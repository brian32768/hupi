<font size="5">Ventilation of Streamlined HPVs (reprint)</font>

<p><img src="FIG01.gif" style="float: left;" alt="FIG 1: Optimized ventilating system. DIAGRAM BY JOHN NOBILE" border="0" height="413" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="260">When
making ventilation holes in the fairing of an HPV, a certain amount of
drag will be induced due to the disruption of external air flow and the
initiation of internal airflow. This increase in drag may be
substantially reduced through the use of a diffuser.<br>
<br>
A diffuser is a device that reduces the velocity of air while
increasing the pressure. If properly designed, an efficiency of about
65% can be expected with respect to conservation of energy.&nbsp;
A nozzle can also be used to reaccelerate the exiting air from the
interior of the vehicle.&nbsp;
Because this set-up allows the minimum amount of air to pass through
the vehicle at a low velocity, the drag caused by this air is very
small.&nbsp;
Also, the air enters and exits at near free-stream velocity, which
minimizes the
disturbance to external air-flow.<br>
<br>
<img src="FIG02.gif" style="float: right;" alt="FIG 2: Diffuser Geometry. Area Ratio = 4; Efficiency = .65 DIAGRAM BY JOHN NOBILE" border="0" height="409" hspace="14" vspace="14" width="277">In
order to design a diffuser of correct size and shape, the minimum
velocity at which it must provide adequate ventilation must be
decided.&nbsp;
It is desirable to have an additional closable vent for very-low-speed
operation (hill climbs) so that the diffusers will not be oversized for
efficient ventilation at normal speeds.<br>
<br>
A minimum effective speed of 15 m/s (33 mph) is chosen, and an air-flow
requirement of 2
liters/sec is considered adequate.&nbsp; By choosing the
ratio of diffuser outlet-to-inlet areas to be four, the velocity of
incoming air will be reduced by a factor of four before it enters the
interior.&nbsp;
There is a corresponding pressure increase associated with this
velocity reduction, which is where the kinetic energy of the air is
stored until the air is reaccelerated out of the vehicle.<br>
<br>
To determine the inlet area required, the volume flow rate is divided by the free-stream velocity;
</p>
<p align="left"><img src="EQ.gif" alt="EQUATION: inlet area = (2 liters/sec) / (15 m/s) = 1.33 cm^2" border="0" height="41" width="225">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The free-stream velocity is equal to the rate of the vehicle if the
inlet is located at the nose of the vehicle. This is the logical place
since the relative velocity of the air is minimal. The value for the
inlet area should be increased by about 12% to compensate for viscous
forces, (1) This gives an inliet area of 1.5 cm2, yielding an exit area
of four times that, or 6 cm2. The only thing left to determine is the
divergence angle, or slenderness ratio, which can be determined from a
diffuser performance map once the geometry is known (2). The diffuser
efficiency is dependent on this angle.<br>
<br>
For a flat-walled diffuser with a square inlet, a length-to-inlet width
ratio of 14 will give an efficiency of 65%. Using a conical diffuser
with a
length-to-inlet diameter ratio of 14 gives about the same efficiency,
which is near maximum.<br>
<br>
As can be seen from this analysis, a properly designed vent opening
will be small and the the drag induced by it will be small. In theory,
if the vehicle were sealed, a nozzle should be placed at the tail to
reaccelerate the air that is being expelled.<br>
<br>
The nozzle may not be necessary in all cases, since in reality there
are openings in the fairing for wheels, which will draw out the air.<br>
<br>
By the using of properly designed diffusers, fully faired human-powered
vehicles can be more efficient and practical for longer rides and for
everyday use.<br>
