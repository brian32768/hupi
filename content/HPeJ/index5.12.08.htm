<b><big><big style="font-style: italic;">Invitation to submit papers to
the
6th European Seminar on Velomobile Design, </big></big><br>

</b><span style="font-style: italic;">Copenhagen, Denmark -- October 16
-17, 2009
<br>

<br style="font-style: italic;">

</span><br>

<div style="text-align: left;"> The series of Velomobile Design
Seminars started in 1993 in Copenhagen. Through 15 years, the seminars
have provided an important inspiration to the development of
velomobiles
for practical transport and sport. <br>

<br>

The need for velomobiles as an alternative, environmental
friendly means of transportation in today's world is more obvious than
ever.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

In
many situations a velomobile can replace a car and offers more cargo
space, increased weather protection, better aerodynamics and higher
speed than an
ordinary bicycle. People require physical activity for health care
reasons, to stay or to become fit thus enhancing one's quality of
life.&nbsp; A
velomobile provides a comfortable and secure means to engage in
necessary healthful exercise. <br>

<br>

The velomobile does not increase greenhouse-gas emissions, a serious
issue gaining greater attention in the last 5 years. <br>

<br>

The United
Nations (Conference of Parties under UNFCCC) has called for the next
Climate Conference to be held the first week of December 2009, in the
Bella
Center of Copenhagen. On this occasion, let us demonstrate the
potential of velomobiles for an environmental friendly lifestyle. The
Velomobile Design Seminars allows discussion of many subjects, such as
social acceptance of velomobiles, solutions for the infrastructure,
technical innovations and vehicle design and styling. <br>

<br>

The seminar organization invites you to present your contributions,
sharing skills and knowledge necessary for further development of
velomobiles. <br>

<br>

Send your abstract (maximum 500 words) to:
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 204); font-weight: bold;">designseminar
&lt;at&gt; liggecykelforeningen.dk</span>
before October 31st, 2008. <br>

<br>

The abstracts will be reviewed by the
program committee consisting of:
Dr. Andreas Fuchs of Switzerland,
M.Sc. Frederik Van De Walle of Belgium and Sweden,
Dr. Stefan Gloger of Germany
and Dr. Carl Georg Rasmussen of Denmark. <br>

<br>

You will be informed not later
than December 31st, 2008, whether your
poposal is accepted. If your abstract is accepted you will receive
instruction for authors. Deadline for submission of final paper will be
August 31th , 2009. The proceedings of the 6th Velomobile Design
Seminar will be published in digital form only by the Human Power
Institute<br>

<br>

It would be great to meet
you 2009 in Copenhagen! <br>

<br>

With kind regards,<br>

Andreas Fuchs<br>
