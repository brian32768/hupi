  <h2><big>Introduction</big></h2>
  <p>Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736 &#8211; 1806) was a French physicist
who is today well-known for his work in the field of electrostatics and
geotechnical engineering. The SI unit of charge (coulomb = ampère
second) and several physical laws are named after him. He was also a
civil engineer and developed models for stress and friction of solids
and soil. <br>
  </p>
  <p>While looking through Coulomb's major work on friction "Théorie
des machines simples", I came across a 43-page section on human power,
or more precisely on the work done by men mainly when elevating loads.
Coulomb presented his research to the Académie des Sciences in Paris
and was a awarded a grand prize in 1781. It is today available in a
368-page book published in 1821. Google Books lists <a

less than eight copies</a>, mostly its own scans of various library
copies in the Public Domain.</p>
  <p>This article <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is</span>
will be a summary of Coulomb's findings and HPeJ also
  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">offers</span> will offer
you perhaps the first freely available translation of this
section.<br>

  <h2><big><b>Coulomb's method</b></big><br>
  </h2>
In his early professional life, Coulomb worked as a civil and military
engineer in France and abroad. He was thus often confronted with teams
of men and animals shifting soil and building materials. With his
scientific mind he immediately began to measure and record the amount
of physical work being done and compared the efficiency of different
situations.<br>
  <br>
Coulomb's interest appears to have been primarly in recording the
maximum amount of daily work which a man can do day after day and not
in increasing the efficiency of the work. Thus he was most interested
in situations where loads were transported uphill, as this the work is
then easy to measure as potential energy. Coulomb included the weight
of the workers themselves and also calculated round trips, so was able
to calculate the efficiencies achieved with respect to the potential
energy gained. In contrast, when transporting loads without elevating
them, the potential energy gain is zero and the efficiency in this
respect is also zero.<br>
