<h2>The Effect of Static Leg Position and Cadence on the Drag of a Cyclist</h2>


<p>Kim B. Blair, Guo-Liang Chew, and Mark Cote
<br />

October 2, 2007</p>



<h4 class="abstract">Abstract</h4>

<p class="abstract">A test was conducted using a wind-tunnel comparing the aerodynamic drag of a bicyclist when pedaling to when not pedaling.</p>



<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>For individual cycling events such as time trials and the bicycling
portion of a triathlon, reducing aerodynamic drag is of the utmost
importance. Two methods commonly used to measure the aerodynamic
performance of a cyclist include wind-tunnel testing and coast-down
tests.</p>


<p>During wind-tunnel testing, the cyclist typically pedals at a
relatively low cadence, about 40 rpm, in order to minimize the effect
of the rider's movements on the drag measurement apparatus. Data is
collected over a sufficiently long time, at least 30 seconds, to
average out the effects of the pedal position.</p>

<p>In the absence of a wind-tunnel facility, a cyclist might make use
of indirect methods such as coast-down tests. While coasting without
pedaling, the cyclist uses a long downhill straight measuring the time
over a set distance. By observing the speed of the descent and the
gradient of the downhill section, the cyclist can determine drag.</p>


<p>In either case, the cyclist does not pedal in the same way during
the aerodynamic test as during competition, where the cyclist would
typically pedal at a cadence of 85 - 95 rpm. In a coast-down test, the
legs are held in a static position. In the wind-tunnel, the pedaling
cadence is about half that of normal racing.</p>


<p>The usefulness of both coast-down and wind-tunnel tests is improved
when test results provide the best insight to actual cycling
conditions. In order to understand the effect of leg position and
cycling cadence on the drag of a cyclist, a short wind-tunnel test was
completed to measure the drag of a cyclist with the legs in several
static positions, and with the legs spinning at different cadences.</p>



<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>All testing was conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's&nbsp;<a href="http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/www/labs/WBWT/">Wright Brothers wind-tunnel</a>
using a specially-designed bike fixture mounted on the tunnel balance
[reference]. The bicycle used during the tests was a standard roadbike
with clip-on aero bars. The cyclist was a male member of the MIT
Cycling Team, seated on the bike in an aero position. The cyclist wore
an aerodynamic helmet, standard cycling jersey, and cycling shorts
[notes 1 - 4].</p>


<p>Wind speed during the tests was set at 13.4 m/s, 0 degree yaw angle.
Static pressure, dynamic pressure, temperature, humidity, drag force,
and side force were measured in the tunnel and all recorded at 1000 Hz.
Each test condition was monitored for 30 seconds, with the average and
standard deviation calculated for each test point. All drag data was
normalized to standard sea level conditions for a nominal wind speed of
13.4 m/s to account for any fluctuation in wind speed during or between
tests. Statistical significance of the drag difference for each test
condition was evaluated using two-sample z-tests (alpha = 0.05).</p>


<p>The first series of tests measured the drag at static crank
positions. Figures 1-4 depict the individual crank positions held by
the cyclist for each measurement at 0, 30, 60 and 90 degrees. The crank
angle was determined by an electronic inclinometer [note 5].</p>

<p>The second series of tests measured the drag of the rider pedaling
with a cadence of 40, 60, 80 and 100 rpm. The rider monitored his
cadence using a bicycle-mounted cycling computer with a wired cadence
sensor [note 6].</p>


<h3>Results</h3>


<p>Table 1 shows the results of the static leg position test. The drag
ranges from 27.4 - 29.3 N and is highest for the crank arms
perpendicular to the ground - the zero degree position. The standard
deviation on each test is less than 0.25 N. The drag difference for
each case was found to be statistically different than the other cases.</p>

<p>Table 2 shows the results of the cadence test. Drag variation
between the cadences is quite small ranging from 27.5 - 27.9 N. The
largest standard deviation for this test was 1 N for the 40 rpm case.
The drag difference between each case and every other case was found
not to be statistically significant.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>


<p>It is not surprising that the cyclist's drag was significantly
affected by crank position. The highest drag occurred for the case of
the crank arms normal to the ground. This position would present the
rider with the largest frontal area. It was somewhat surprising that
the case of the pedals in the horizontal position was not the smallest
drag value, although the positions near the crank arms being horizontal
resulted in lower drag. The standard deviation for each test was quite
small.</p>


<p>The difference in drag between pedal positions varied from 1 - 5%.
As coast-down tests with the rider in a static position are sometimes
used to measure the effect of equipment changes, the results of this
test show that controlling crank arm and leg position is quite
important. The variation between crank arm and leg positions could be
larger than the result expected from a change in equipment.</p>


<p>Pedaling cadence showed little effect on the measured aerodynamic
drag, with only a 1% variation between test conditions. Thus, any
desired pedaling cadence can be used for wind-tunnel testing.</p>


<p>The drag measured for a rider when pedaling is not influenced in a
significant way by the speed of pedaling, in the 40-100-rpm range. The
drag measured while the rider is pedaling turned out to be a little
smaller than the average of measurements taken with the rider's feet
stationary at various positions around the pedaling circle. We do not
know the reason for this difference, but it is quite small. We conclude
that it is valid to take wind-tunnel drag measurements with the rider 
pedaling anywhere in the 40-100-rpm range.
