      <h3>The Niesenlauf</h3>
      <img style="width: 266px; height: 400px; float: left;" alt="Niesen stairs"
        src="niesenstairs.jpg" hspace="10">The peak in the Swiss Bernese
      Oberland known as the Niesen has a funicular railway up its flank. There
      is a flight of steps alongside the whole way, supposedly the world's
      longest.&nbsp;It has 11'674 steps and goes from an altitude of 693 m to
      2336 m, giving a difference of 1643 m. Then there is a footpath to the
      peak itself at 2362 m, giving total 1669 m altitude gain. The organisers
      list 1723 m; there may be some short descents. Since 2004 there is an
      annual opportunity to race up the steps in summer, including the flatter
      bit at the top. Details are provided in German at the website <a target="_blank"
        href="http://www.niesenlauf.ch/">www.niesenlauf.ch</a>. A picture from
      this website shows the bottom part of the steps apparently here covered by
      a metal surface and steepening further up.<br>
      <br>
      The best times up the total 1679 meter climb are around 1 hour for younger
      men and the overall record 55 minutes (2011) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Vaudan">Emmanuel
        Vaudan</a>. &nbsp;Using the equation below, if we assume that these
      contestants have a mass of 80 kg, the average power is about 365 W to 400
      W (record).<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">P [W] = m [kg] · g
        [m/s</span><sup style="font-style: italic;">2</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">]
        · h [m] / t [s]</span><br>
      <br>
      where m is the person's mass, g is the local gravity at the midpoint at
      9.803 m/s<sup>2</sup>, h is the height climbed, and t is the time taken.<br>
      <br>
      This power level is about at the level given by the NASA curve for "first
      class athletes" engaged in foot cranking (see <a title="Human Power Curves"
        href="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0011/HumanPowerCurves.png">here</a>,
      from <a href="http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/45-v13n2-1998.pdf" target="_blank">Human
        Power 45</a> page 18 (3.9 MB PDF download), even though most of the
      contestants are local amateurs. It can be concluded that climbing stairs
      is a pretty efficient way to exert human power.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>
