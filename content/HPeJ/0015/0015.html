    <i>T</i><i>he basic function of a human powered series
hybrid (SH) drive is the same as that of today's electric bicycle
drives, which are parallel hybrids (PH). A SH drive is more versatile
for the same cost. There are no mechanical transmission elements so
that maintenance is simplified. The article covers the history of SH
drives up to the year 2005 and includes a comprehensive reference list.<br>

  <br>
In a parallel hybrid (PH) human-electric drive, an electric motor
converts electricity to mechanical power and this is added to the
mechanical human power by adding the respective torques at a common
element, e.g. wheel or chain wheel. <br>
  <br>
In an electrical series hybrid (SH) human-electric
drive, the human power is converted into electricity using a pedaled
generator, added electrically to the available stored electricity, and
the total converted to mechanical power using an electric motor. The
author and his colleagues first used the term &#8220;chainless
transmission&#8221;
for vehicles which didn't necessarily require the use of a storage
battery. More recently the terms parallel hybrid (PH) and series hybrid
(SH) have been used. The figure to the right shows how the SH drive can
be expanded to systems with multiple inputs and outputs for any mobile
or stationary device.<br>
  <br>
  <small>[Editor's note: In a further type which might be called&nbsp;a
mechanical series hybrid drive, the two inputs are combined using
differential gears by adding the
respective speeds at a common torque. The motor must therefore handle
the torque available in the lowest pedal gear. In use this type is more
similar to the PH drive and is not the subject if this article. This is
an updated, condensed and editted version. The complete text of the

How a Series Hybrid Human Power Drive works</b></p>

 alt="drawing of pedal generator module [Mark Wyss 2001]"
 src="pedalgenerator-1.jpg" hspace="5">Mechanical
human power output is converted into electric power by
a generator driven by pedals and appropriate gearing. The electrical
and hence also mechanical load on the generator is controlled by power
electronics which not only optimises the generator's operating point in
terms of voltage and current, but also the human's, by providing a good
"feel" in terms of resistance (torque) and speed (cadence). The SH
drive is a
transmission in the sense that the electrical energy from the generator
need not be used to charge a battery, but can be fed directly to one or
more motors via suitable electronic controllers. If the vehicle needs
less power than is being produced by the generator, the energy can be
stored in a battery of accumulators or capacitors. These can also be
charged by external sources. <br>

 src="FIG01.jpg" align="left"><br>
The first research with velomobiles was conducted at the University of
Applied Sciences in Berne during 1994 to 1999. The initial research
using mechanical SH drives based on planetary gears was discontinued
because they were thought to be too expensive, unreliable and complex
to be developed further. The electrical SH drive was conceived in order
to radically simplify the drive system. Tests of working models
conducted in 1997 and 1998 yielded positive results and in 1999 to 2005
the
author attempted a commercial realization of the SH drive system.<br>
  <br>
At the time, high torque, low speed,
brushless electric machines of
high efficiency were not available at a reasonable price, so together
with M. Lindegger and J. Gilgen custom prototypes were developed. Today
this type of electric machine is&nbsp; produced by <a target="_blank"
 href="http://www.circlemotor.ch">www.circlemotor.ch</a>. <br>
  <br>
The first generator prototype ran below 1000 rpm. These machines were
too heavy and smaller
generators running between 1000 and 2000 rpm were produced.<br>
  <br>
Between 2000 and 2002, under the name of Autork Ltd., a decentralized
SH control system was developed for the &#8220;Urban Quadracycle&#8221; (early
version shown in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b), using the Circlemotor electric
machines. &nbsp;The associated control system used a serial CAN bus to
distribute the
information signals. Development stopped when a major shareholder of
Autork went into
bankruptcy.<br>

  <img style="width: 444px; height: 500px;" alt="figure 2b"
 src="FIG02b.jpg">
  <p>In 2003 the system was put onto a two-wheeled EZ1 recumbent cycle
equipped with electric machines from <a target="_blank"
 href="http://www.perm-motor.de/index_e.html">www.perm-motor.de</a> to
test if a SH
drive is feasible not only for &#8220;Ultralight-Mobiles&#8221;, but also for
e-bikes.<br>
  </p>
It was found that the range using a typical e-bike battery was
competitive compared to the ranges of commercial parallel hybrid
e-bicycles, as tested by ExtraEnergy in 2001 and 2002 (see <a
 target="_blank" href="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0009/0009.htm">HPeJ
article 9</a>).<br>
During 2004 to 2005 a recumbent tricycle was equipped with a fully
encapsulated SH drive. &nbsp;The gear ratio of the pedaled generator
was no longer around 1:50 as in
the first working models from 1997/98, but 1:30 to 1:20.<br>

  <b><br>
Drive Dynamics</b><br>
  <br>
In a SH vehicle, human and machine (electric motor) are only coupled by
electrical means. The motor of a SH vehicle needs to provide 100% of
the power, that is, the sum of human and electric power. The motor of a
SH vehicle is therefore about twice as strong as in an equivalent PH
vehicle. Any combination of human and electric power is possible
according to
the program defined in the controller.<br>
  <br>
The gear ratio between pedal and wheel of a SH drive is infinity. This
particularly suits velomobiles which are slow uphill and fast on the
flat. Downhill recuperation is standard and saves brakes while
promoting safety.<br>
  <br>
  <b><br>
Efficiency</b><br>
  <br>
The SH drive system does not compare with a purely mechanical chain
drive e.g. of a racing bike but was not made to replace such drives,
but&nbsp;rather to replace mechanically complex hybrid drive systems.<br>
  <br>
The first working models of the SH drive were equipped with brushed
generators with peak efficiencies of between 55 and 70% and with
brushed motors with about 80% peak efficiency. However we were
astonished that we rode about as long and far as typical PH e-bikes.
This was confirmed when Chapelle and collegues measured efficiencies of
PH
e-bikes of between 55% and 95%. Thus it is possible to build SH
vehicles with better efficiencies than the poorer PH bikes.<br>
  <br>
So far we only discussed&nbsp; &#8220;peak&#8221; efficiency. If the average
efficiency during the whole trip is considered, the efficiency of SHs
compared to that of PHs starts to look interesting. <br>
In urban traffic a vehicle is on constant speed only for a minor part
of the travel time. Therefore the advantage of high peak efficiency at
one operating point of a parallel PH remains advantageous only if the
efficiency at other operating points is also good and/or if the gears
are used effectively to stay in the optimal region.<br>
  <br>
People not trained in optimal operation of traditional bicycle gears
often pedal off their peak efficiency because humans have a quite
narrow peak of high efficiency at some power levels.<br>
A&nbsp;major advantage of the SH is that the system can react more
quickly
than mechanical gears. The efficiency of the system can be maximized
electronically at every moment. The human being can be optimally
loaded: the "load-leveling"&nbsp;capability of SH's is very
advantageous from a
physiological point of view. This was borne out by the author and
colleagues and by Daniel Couque
(who constantly pedals a generator while manually operating the
throttle of the electric motor of his velomobile). The experiences are
too few to draw final conclusions yet, but it cannot be easily
discounted
that the physiological advantages of a SH could over-compensate the
disadvantage of peak efficiency of a SH compared to a PH.<br>
  <br>
  <b><br>
Weight<br>
  <br>
  </b>The generator module shown in Figure 3 weighs 4.3 kg including
pedals
and pedal arms. This is about the same as a chain drive with
dérailleur
or less than a drive with 3 x 7 gear hub.
  <p><img style="width: 781px; height: 633px;" alt="figure 3"
 src="FIG03.jpg"><br>
  </p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Cost</span><br>
  <br>
The main difference between a PH drive and a SH
drive is the generator. To compare the cost of these drive systems it
is sufficient to compare the cost of the generator with the cost of a
mechanical bicycle drive system.<br>
  <br>
A pedaled generator can be made for approximately the cost of a hub
wheel motor and motor controller. Compared to continuously variable
mechanical or hydraulic transmissions for bicycles (not on the market),
there is no cheaper and simpler CVT (continuously variable
transmission) than a drive with pedaled generator! A pedaled
generator contains about the same sub-modules as modern electric drills
available at reasonable prices.<br>
  <br>
The main initial cost is that of developing the system (software and
power electronics) and the components not available on the
market. Overall cost reductions are possible by the simplification of
the
vehicular mechanical design. The channels for chains or intermediate
axles can be eliminated completely.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
  <br>
Conclusions</span><br>
  <br>
During the last decade's work on preparing the SH drive system for
industrialization, the author and colleagues recognized that:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>An SH drive can be operated very dynamically.</li>
    <li>The weight difference between SH and PH drives is small.</li>
    <li>An SH drive does not have to cost more than a PH drive.</li>
    <li>The efficiency of an SH drive is sufficient for practical use
and
excellent if physiological effects are taken into account.</li>
