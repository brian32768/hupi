  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  Juice making provides an important way of preserving large quantities of fruit
  and vegetables for human consumption.&nbsp; This can be done with electrically
  powered machines, but many situations exist when human-powered juicing
  represents the most practical option.&nbsp; In my case this begins with an
  apple tree which during several weeks in August delivers 5 -10 kg of fruit
  per day. The apples are a curious variety, which must be processed within a
  day or two to avoid spoiling.&nbsp; This amount is ideal for
  traditional hand-powered equipment.&nbsp; A local juicing service, usually not
  available until later in the harvest season,
  requires a minimum quantity about ten times larger .&nbsp; A hand-operated pulper and press
  allow me to utilize more of the tree's apples and saves making trips to the
  commercial juicer.&nbsp;Much of the information here also applies to grapes
  and other fruit.<br>

  <h3>The juicing process</h3>
The juicing process involves gathering, sorting, washing [fig. 1],
pulping [fig.   2], pressing [fig. 3], and preserving for storage unless quickly
  consumed.&nbsp; Pulping represents the key step,
accomplished with a hopper-fed rotary rasp. The pulper's wooden cylinder
is covered with over 50 sharp stainless steel studs (visible dimensions
about 4 x 4 x 4 mm) [fig. 4]. The interior hopper dimensions are about 10 x 10 x
  10 cm, perfect for small apples.&nbsp; The
interior cylinder diameter is 21 cm, the height 24 cm. The resulting pulp is put into a fabric
  bag placed inside the press, where about 40% of
the weight is extracted as juice&nbsp; [figs. 3 and 5].&nbsp;

  <h3>Human powered juice preservation</h3>
  <h4>Fermentation and traditional preservation </h4>
  <p> Traditionally apple juice may be consumed fresh or preserved by pasteurization in various stages of fermentation (conversion of sugars to alcohol) ranging from sweet through hard cider to apple wine and ultimately apple vinegar.  The dominating yeast cultures influence the taste.  Sometimes other microbial action takes over to render the juice unpalatable.&nbsp;
  Hence, modern standards of taste conformity and hygiene insist on tighter control than was the custom in the past. Today, heating to about 80° C pasteurizes fresh-pressed sweet apple juice.
  Afterward the juice is cooled allowing excessive solids to settle forming a sediment.&nbsp; For harder cider, pasteurized juice
  ferments under controlled conditions utilizing specific yeast cultures.  Further pasteurization halts the fermentation at a chosen point.&nbsp;
  All this heating is of course energy consuming.&nbsp; There is another less energy intensive way.</p>

  <h4>Preservation by pressure</h4>
  <p>Fermentation slows or stops at above 5 - 9 bar, depending on
storage temperature and   the composition of gases present.&nbsp; Because a
  living yeast culture outgases carbon dioxide, a tightly closed container will
  self-pressurize. This increased pressure will temporarily slow the fermentation rate. This is not
  true &quot;pressure pasteurization&quot;,
which requires about 5000 bar. <br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;I simply fill the raw juice into bottles made of glass or
plastic (PET).&nbsp; After a few days, the juice within a closed
container begins to build up considerable pressure.&nbsp; Ordinary
bottles aren't suited for this and could be   dangerous.&nbsp; Out of a
  approximately one hundred, I have had one glass and one   plastic bottle of the 1-liter size
  explode.&nbsp; Thankfully I wasn't around.&nbsp;Thus, I&nbsp; recommend using
  bottles less than 1-liter, unless the juice is to be consumed within a short
  while after bottling.&nbsp; Smaller, thus
stronger, bottles have never ruptured.&nbsp; The greatest danger is to the eyes
  in the event of a glass container breaking without warning. Wearing heavy-duty safety goggles could
prevent serious injury when handling or working around sealed bottles.&nbsp; The pressure
  preserved juice tastes sweet,&nbsp; with a slight alcohol content and
a carbonated tang.&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; Fermentation can be halted even more
quickly and thus with a lower alcohol content by increasing the initial
pressure from an external source and using cooler   storage
conditions.&nbsp; I do this by mounting bicycle tire valves in bottle
caps and pressurizing with a tire pump [fig 6].&nbsp; Opening the
bottles later can be   messy and exciting. A significant volume of
carbon dioxide may be released causing the fluid to foam considerably.&nbsp;
In these cases the reward of juice making is a glass of
apple-champagne!&nbsp; Other times faulty bottle tops leak at
just the right rate for the juice to preserve and then lose pressure
without the formation of hard cider or vinegar.&nbsp; These
fortunate "accidents" have not   been consistently reproducible.<br>

  <p>More efficient and far safer than bottles are special stainless
steel kegs.&nbsp; Mine has 30 liters volume.&nbsp;   Ideally this
container would be filled completely then sealed to help reduce the amount of
  oxygen present, which contributes to the formation of
  vinegar. In order to preserve   quantities of
juice less than 30 liters, I pressurize the less-than-full steel
container using an air pump. However pumping in carbon dioxide rather than the
  ambient air may be more
suitable.&nbsp; Future plans   include injecting the juice day-by-day
under pressure by using a feed pump.&nbsp; All of these notions include
  human-power of course! <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p>A typical run consists of processing 100 small apples (6 kg)&nbsp;
into 2 -   2.5 liters of juice.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The pulper operates most comfortably&nbsp; at about 100 rpm.&nbsp;
The corresponding force on the crank is 40 - 50 N,&nbsp; giving a
torque of 7.6 - 9.5 Nm with the 0.19 m crank.&nbsp; Thus, the power
delivered by the operator equals 80 -100 W.&nbsp; One filling of the
hopper requires about 9 turns, i.e. about 5 seconds.&nbsp;   The force
on the push lever is also 40-50 N, but nearly static.&nbsp; So not much
power is used.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The power required to operate the press is also quite small.&nbsp;
Most effort is spent preparing and handling the tools and materials and
general cleaning. <br>
