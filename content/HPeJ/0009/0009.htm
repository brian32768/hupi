<h1>Analysis and Visualisation of Data Collected from Human-Electric
Hybrid Bicycle-Tests</h1>
<p class="AuthorAndDate">Andreas Fuchs<br>

<p class="Abstract">The German non-profit organization <a target="_blank" href="http://extraenergy.org">ExtraEnergy</a> tested
human-electric hybrid vehicles&nbsp; in 2001 and in 2002, (e-bikes
and pedelecs, see <a href="#Note:">note</a>).&nbsp; This paper
compiles, visualizes and
discusses the resulting data. Such compilations are
helpful to benchmark new vehicles or drive systems, to show what
levels of performance are common and&nbsp; to identify what kind of
products are best suited for the user's intended application. </p>

<h3 style="clear: left;">Test Methods</h3>
<p> A detailed description of these tests appears in ExtraEnergy's test
reports <a href="#Note:">[1]</a> and <a href="#Note:">[2]</a>.&nbsp; Both
trial series took place in realistic field conditions with many
different
riders. The tests were conducted both on mainly level and on mainly
constant slope
courses. On a "mixed track" portion of the testing,
the riders stopped several times to simulate red lights.&nbsp; The
distance vehicles were able to travel (range) was determined by
riding until the batteries were considered discharged. </p>
<p>Differences between both tests were:</p>
<ol>
  <li> In the 2001 test the assist ratio of electric power to human
power wasn't measured.&nbsp; Climbing speed was recorded on two
different ascending grades; one had&nbsp; an average 6.3% slope
(max 8%), the other exhibited an average 8% slope (max 12%).&nbsp;
Range on slopes was not recorded. </li>
  <li>In the 2002 test the assist-ratio was measured by comparing the
power assisted vehicles with similar unassisted bicycles.&nbsp; All
vehicles were equipped with force-measuring pedals.&nbsp; Power
(product of pedaling torque and cadence) was measured at three
different speeds of the unassisted reference bike and for all
assisted bikes. Electrical power used by the system was measured at
the battery.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Test Data</h3>
<p>The format in which the test data was reported was different in 2001
and 2002. For easier analysis most of the data of both tests was
compiled into a table. See <a href="#Appendix:">Appendix</a>.</p>
<p> In 2002 the amount of power assist was reported using the assist
rate (R) and the assist factor (F). The
assist rate is the ratio of the electric drive power (Pe),
measured at the battery to the total mechanical power delivered to
the drive wheel (Pw). The assist factor is the ratio of
electric drive power (Pe) to the human supplied power as measured at
the pedals (Php).&nbsp; If the assist factor is
greater than 1, then the electric power is greater than the human's
power contribution.</p>
<p>The assist rate and factor are derived as follows:<br>
</p>
<p>Php = Human power (pedalling power)<br>
Pe = Power of the electric drive<br>
Pw = Total drive power at wheel<br>
R = Assist rate = Pe / Pw<br>
F = Assist factor = Pe / Php = R / (1-R)</p>
<p>Because the human energy contribution (Php) is measured at the
pedals instead of at the drive wheel, these relationships assume a
pedal drive efficiency of 100% whereas the efficiency of the motor
drive is unknown. [This means that the
assist factor measured here is higher than the actual effective assist
factor. Ed.]</p>
<p>These factors can be used to estimate the contributions of human
power and electric power to range (at the same speeds):</p>
<p>Range using electric power only = total range * assist rate<br>
Range using human power only = total range - range using electric power
only</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p><b>Drive Performance and Energy Expenditure</b></p>
<p>It was found that most parameters hardly differed between the two
tests.</p>
<p>However, in 2002 the average battery capacity was higher than in
2001: 193 Wh instead of 155 Wh.</p>
<p>Bike prices didn't vary much within the same classes. The average
price, excepting the fast Swiss bikes, was about 1500 Euro.</p>
<p>Key results for both 2001 and 2002 were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>About 30 km range and 20 km/h average speed on level/mixed-track</li>
  <li> About 7 km range at a speed of 11 km/h on slope of 7% [about 500
m altitude gain, i.e. total range back to starting altitude would be at
least 14 km, with higher average speed. Ed.]</li>
</ul>

[Table 1] The highest variation (standard deviation divided by average)
is found in weight of battery. Average speed varies relatively little.
</p><p class="ImageCaption"><img src="fig-1.gif" style="border: 0pt none ;" name="figure 1"><br>
[Figure 1] Ranges and average speeds of the tested bikes on the level.
The average of ranges was about 30km and the average of average speeds
was about 20 km/h. The top speed of most vehicles was (by law) under
24km/h in hybrid mode; that of the Dolphin 39 km/h.</p>
<p>Dividing range by battery capacity (see <a href="#Appendix:">Appendix</a>)
gives energy use
(including human power but not considering this in the calculation):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Energy use is about 0.18 km/Wh or 6 Wh/km on the level</li>
  <li>Energy use is about 0.04 km/Wh or 27 Wh/km on the slopes</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the assist rate (calculated from data in Appendix) one can
easily estimate how far the human electric hybrids would have gone
using only electric power (at the same speed): (Range * Assist rate) =
Range using electric power only. The "purely electric range" would
average 16.5 km and the energy use would average&nbsp;12.4 Wh/km on the
level.</p>
<p>If it is assumed that all tested bikes would have the same
aerodynamic drag (effective frontal area assumed to be 0.5 m2) and
rolling resistance (coefficient of rolling resistance assumed to be
0.007), then the ratio of the power needed to go on the level and to
climb can be estimated. On the 7% slope at 11 km/h the total power
required is about 2.5 times larger than on the level at 20 km/h. The
ratio of energy use measured above is however 27 / 6 = 4.5. This is
probably because at higher power levels the actual (in)efficiency of
the electric drive weighs more strongly.</p>
<p class="ImageCaption"><img src="fig-2.gif" style="border: 0pt none ;" name="figure 2"><br>
[Figure 2] Average speed and energy use for various models.</p>
<p>This shows that in general higher average speed leads to higher
energy use (Wh/km) when riding on the level, but with considerable
variations.</p>
<p class="ImageCaption"><img src="fig-3.gif" style="border: 0pt none ;" name="figure 3"><br>
[Figure 3] Assist factor on the level and on the slope for various
models.</p>
<p>On average, the assistance does not change much from the level to
the slope: on the level the assist factor is 1.23, and on the slopes
1.77. These ratios are higher than the 1 : 1 factor much promoted and
discussed in the 1990's.</p>
<p>These figures also show that while in many cases the assist factors
do not differ much between level and slope, those of vehicles made in
the hilly and alpine regions of Europe have much higher assist factors
on slopes than on the level.</p>
<h3>Dependencies between Parameters</h3>
<p>By plotting parameters against others one can try to identify those
most important for the performance.</p>
<p>We plotted the "performance parameters" like range and speed over
the "feature parameters" like price, weight of vehicle, weight of
battery, assist factors in order to identify trends that could exist.
Here are some results of interest.</p>
<p>We would like to know the answers to questions like: "Do the lighter
or the heavier bikes climb better?" "Does range on the level change
much with average speed ?"</p>
<p>In the graphs below, a linear regression line with an upward slope
shows a positive correlation. The figure R<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 9pt;">2</span> gives the
degree correlation between the parameters, from 0 (no correlation) to 1
(strong correlation).</p>

[Table 2] Examples of some stronger correlations between features and
performance of vehicles
</p><p>Examples for unexpectedly weak correlations:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Energy use on slope [Wh/km] versus assist factor [no units]</li>
  <li> Energy use on slope [Wh/km] versus speed [km/h]</li>
</ul>
<p>The vehicles in the 2001 test climbed faster the heavier they were,
since the available power depends on the mass of the motors and
batteries, in contrast to unassisted bikes, where the opposite is true.
[This implies an optimum configuration for each hybrid operating point.
Ed.]</p>
<p>Additionally, if batteries are dimensioned too small, the discharge
efficiency is low at high power levels and therefore the range on
slopes decreases.</p>
<h3>Visualisation</h3>
<p>The data may also be used to visualize general facts for individual
vehicles or average values.</p>
<p class="ImageCaption"><img src="fig-6.gif" style="border: 0pt none ;" name="figure 6"><br>
[Figure 6] Averages of average speed vs. average slope.</p>
<p>Average speed on the level is about 20 km/h (all samples), the
maximum average speed 24.7 km/h (Velocity Dolphin). [Personal
experience with the Dolphin also shows a much flatter curve. Ed.]</p>
<p>At 10 % slope the tested vehicles go nearly 10 km/h.</p>
<p>The dashed line is an extrapolation and suggests a maximum climbing
slope of 18%. Exact values would depend on the actual gearing.</p>
