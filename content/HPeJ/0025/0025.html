original full paper (</span><b style="font-style: italic;"><a

kB). The equation
gives shorter crank lengths than usual even for large persons. A
conclusion is therefore to use shorter than normal cranks if the object
is <span style="font-weight: bold;">peak</span> power.</span><br

  <h3><big>Abstract</big><br>
  </h3>
  <p>The purpose of this paper was to determine: (1) the crank arm
length that would maximize peak power production in an upright cycling
position; (2) the joint angles corresponding to this crank arm length;
(3) which joint angles (minimum, maximum, range of motion of the hip,
knee and ankle) would be the best predictor(s) of the crank arm length;
and (4) develop regression equations to predict the optimal crank arm
length for individuals of different leg lengths. The data from Too and
Landwer (2000) was examined, in conjunction with the data collected in
this study, and combined for use in regression analysis. With stepwise
multiple regression, the following equation was determined to best
predict crank arm lengths that would maximize peak power production in
an upright cycling position for individuals of different leg lengths:<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAL [mm] = (238 [mm] &#8211; 0.25 *
(Tot Leg) [mm] + 0.3 * (Low Leg) [mm]) Â± 22 [mm]<br>
  <br>
As with any prediction equation, caution must be taken when
interpreting and extrapolating the results.<br>
