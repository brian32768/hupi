<h2>Ergonomics of Direct-Drive Recumbent Bicycles</h2>

<p>Jeremy M. Garnet<br />December 21, 2008</p>

<div style="padding: 0pt 40px; font-style: italic;">
	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Abstract</h3>
	<p>The
direct-drive recumbent bicycle has the crank axle concentric with the
front wheel, and a planetary gear front hub. This design offers the
advantage of simplicity, good weight distribution and a large load
capacity&#8212;but has the disadvantage of pedal force feedback to the
handlebars due to the fork mounting of the pedals, and excessive front
assembly mass due to the weight of the rider's feet on the fork-mounted
pedals. This paper explores force feedback as a function of head angle
and a method of calculating an additional centering spring is
presented. A variable-geometry bike is used to give a qualitative,
real-life assessment of the results, and to explore the human-factor
issues unseen in the equations. Finally, a suitable design
configuration is presented.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h3>The direct drive recumbent bike</h3>
<p>The direct-drive recumbent bicycle has the crank axle mounted on the
front fork, concentric with the front wheel axis. Gearing is provided
by a transmission in the front hub. Figure 1 illustrates the basic
layout of the author's direct drive recumbent.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig01.jpg" alt="Figure 1" /><br />Figure 1: A direct-drive recumbent bicycle</p>
<p>This configuration results in a very simple bicycle with no chain,
and it allows a full-size front wheel to be positioned for ideal mass
distribution and braking stability. The result is improved low speed
balancing, a smoother ride, lower rolling resistance, and more
effective braking. In addition, this can all be achieved with a
user-friendly seat height and low bottom bracket, making the design
well suited for in-town riding. The cargo carrying capacity of the
direct drive recumbent is impressive due to the amount of space made
available under the seat.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>A brief history</h3>
<p>The earliest bikes had directly driven front wheel drive. The
ordinary, or high-wheeler is an example. As early as 1892, a planetary
gear hub and a smaller wheel were available to replace the huge front
wheel&#8212;but this design was largely overshadowed by the enormous
popularity of the "safety" rear wheel drive chain driven bike. It was
not until the bicycle design renewal in the 1970s that the idea of a
direct-drive recumbent was seriously explored.</p>
<p>More recently Thomas Kretschmer in 2000 proposed and designed a
direct-drive recumbent with a planetary gear hub for which he has
German patents DE 19736266 and DE 19824745. John Stegmann in 2002
proposed a direct-drive design for cargo-carrying. In the following year the
author built a direct-drive recumbent using a modification of a
Schlumpf Speed-Drive unit.</p>

<h3>Scope of the research</h3>
<p>This research comprises a pedal force feedback analysis, a handling
analysis, an experimental analysis, and conclusions with a recommended
geometry.</p>

<h3>Pedal force feedback</h3>
<p>Since the pedals are mounted on the fork rather than the frame, the
rider's pedaling force generates an alternating steering torque which
the cyclist must resist. A reduction in this would result in a design
that was more user-friendly for new riders and more comfortable.</p>
<p>Kretschmer suggested a shallow head angle to reduce the pedal force
feedback. The shallow inclination aligns the head axis more closely
with the direction of the applied pedal force, reducing the resulting
torque about the steering axis. However this can have an adverse effect
on handling. Therefore it would be useful to find the best compromise
between low pedal force feedback and user-friendly handling.</p>

<h3>Handling</h3>
<p>In a direct-drive recumbent, the mass of the front assembly is
considerably higher than with a regular bicycle and the centre of this
mass is located further from the steering axis.</p>
<p>This increases the torque that is generated around the steering axis
when the bicycle is leaned into a turn or when the steering is turned.
This results in over-control, with more steering response than
necessary for stable hands-free riding. To address this issue, a
direct-drive recumbent requires a different frame and fork geometry.
Kretschmer suggested 2-3 cm of trail (compared to about 5-6 cm in
conventional bikes) and also a centering spring for the steering.</p>

<br />
<h3>METHODS</h3><h3>PEDAL FORCE FEEDBACK ANALYSIS</h3>The pedal force
feedback is evaluated by using the pedal force data of Hull and Davis,
1981.&nbsp; Their data is resolved around the steering axis to obtain
the net torque around the steering axis caused by pedaling.&nbsp; To
translate the data to the recumbent position the concept of the
recumbent angle (figure 2) is introduced.&nbsp; The recumbent angle
indicates the degree of inclination of the recumbent rider relative to
a typical upright bike&#8217;s seat tube angle of 73 degrees.


<p class="figlbl"><a href="fig02l.gif" title="view larger"><img src="fig02.gif" alt="Figure 2" /></a><br />Figure 2: Defining the recumbent angle &#8212; <a href="fig02l.gif">view larger</a></p>

<h3><br />Determining the resulting force restrained by the hands of the rider</h3>
<p>The force that the rider must exert to restrain the net torque around the steering axis depends also on the handlebar position.</p>
<p>Three handlebar positions are commonly used in recumbent bicycles: above-seat, below-seat, and hamster position.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig05.jpg" alt="Figure 5" /><br />Figure 3: Above-seat handlebar position</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig06.jpg" alt="Figure 6" /><br />Figure 4: Below-seat handlebar position</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig07.jpg" alt="Figure 7" /><br />Figure 5: Hamster handlebar position</p>
<p>The above-seat, arms outstretched position &nbsp;(figure 3) allows the arms to be
"locked" in the outstretched position, forming a mechanical brace
between the seat back and the handlebar grips. This reduces the
contribution required of the muscles in the arms, resulting in lower
rider fatigue.</p>
<p>The below-seat position (figure 4) also allows the arms to lock in an
outstretched position, but the plane of the outstretched arms is nearly
parallel to the steering axis. As a result, the advantage of the
mechanical brace of the outstretched arms is lost, and the arms will
instead strenuously resist the pedal induced torque.</p>
<p>The hamster position (figure 5) lacks the bracing advantage of the outstretched
arms, resulting in a greater contribution by the muscle groups in the
arms, and correspondingly increased muscular fatigue.</p>
<p>Therefore, of the three possible positions, the above seat
outstretched arm position is the superior choice for a direct-drive
recumbent. This is also the handlebar position preferred by Stegmann.</p>

<br />
<h3>HANDLING ANALYSIS</h3>

<p>The handling of a bicycle arises from a complex interaction of gravitational, inertial and gyroscopic forces.</p>
<p>For a given head angle, the front wheel trail and the steering
centering spring will determine how a direct-drive recumbent handles.
At low speed, gyroscopic forces are low, and a static analysis of the
applied gravitational forces on the steering can be used to set the
front wheel trail and design an effective centering spring.</p>
<p>When a stationary bike is held vertically and the steering is turned
from the centre, a torque is generated about the head axis (figure 6).
A steering torque is also generated when the bike is leaned to one side
with the steering held on-centre (figure 7). These two effects, which
can be investigated separately, are known as steering-induced torque
and lean-induced torque, respectively. Steering induced torque is also
commonly referred to as "fork flop".</p>
<p class="figlbl"><a href="fig08l.gif" title="view larger"><img src="fig08.jpg" alt="Figure 8" /></a><br />Figure 6: Steering-induced torque &#8212; <a href="fig08l.gif">view larger</a></p>
<p class="figlbl"><a href="fig09l.gif" title="view larger"><img src="fig09.jpg" alt="Figure 9" /></a><br />Figure 7: Lean-induced torque &#8212; <a href="fig09l.gif">view larger</a></p>
<p>The steering-induced torque and lean-induced torque result from two
applied gravitational forces: the force of the ground on the front
wheel and the force due to the offset mass of the front assembly.
"Offset mass of the front assembly" means that the centre of gravity of
the front assembly (i.e. all the parts that swings with the steering)
is offset from the head axis.</p>
<p>The design challenge is to reduce the steering-induced torque and
lean-induced torque to a level that is similar to that of an upright
bike. There are several ways of achieving this reduction.</p>

<h3><br />The question of negative trail</h3>
<p>Jim Papadopoulos in 1987 suggested that a bicycle with a large
offset front assembly mass may benefit from some negative trail. With
negative trail, the ground force on the front wheel produces a torque
in a direction opposite to the torque coming from the offset front
assembly mass, counteracting the effect of excessive front assembly
mass and leading to a manageable torque for good handling.</p>
<p>The difficulty with this approach stems from the exclusion of all
forces except gravity. Lateral forces also act on the front wheel due
to uneven pavement, bumps and ridges. Since the resistance to these
forces is inertial and, at higher speed, also gyroscopic, this produces
a bike that may be quite stable on a smooth flat surface, but jittery
and unsettling to ride on a rough surface.</p>
<p>Experiments with the variable geometry bike described below confirm
this. A negative trail value that has this desired counterbalancing
effect is about 60mm for a 56 degree head angle. The steering is well
constrained on smooth turns, but the overall response of the bike is
highly unfamiliar, particularly at low speed and on uneven surfaces.
Therefore, in spite of the theoretical advantages of negative trail in
controlling excessive front assembly mass, it is rejected because it
lacks overall user-friendliness and stability.</p>

<h3><br />The question of a counter-balance mass</h3>
<p>Another way of balancing the offset front assembly mass is to add a
counter-balance mass. This mass would have to be considerable, however,
and therefore this idea is rejected also.<br /></p>

<h3>Determining trail and centering spring constant</h3>Excluding these
options, the trail and centering spring constant are determined by
equating the steering-induced torque of a direct-drive recumbent to
that of a reference upright bike.&nbsp; This ensures that at least the
fork-flop characteristics of the direct-drive recumbent will be similar
to a regular upright bike&#8212;increasing user-friendliness.<br /><br />
<h3>EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS</h3>

<p>The purpose of the experimental part of this study is to assess the
calculated results qualitatively. To do this a variable geometry bike
(figure 8) was constructed to test the head angles with the corresponding trail
values and spring constants. The bike employs the wheels, seat,
handlebars, brakes, and transmission of the author's bike of figure 1.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig10.jpg" alt="Figure 10" /><br />Figure 8: Variable geometry test bike</p>
<p>The frame of the variable geometry bike is constructed so that
changes in head angle and trail do not affect the positioning of the
major frame members, and so that the position of the rider on the bike
remains unchanged. This is done by using a headset hinge (A) which can
be located in a range of positions on the "down tube" of the frame. The
down tube is, in fact, not a tube but rather it is composed of four
plates: two upper plates (B) and two lower plates (C) which sandwich
the respective hinge flanges. At the opposite ends the lower plates
sandwich a flange attached to the main horizontal frame member, and at
the upper end the upper plates surround a flange attached to the fork
assembly. The plates are accurately machined and held to the flanges by
shoulder bolts. Thus by changing the four plates both the head angle
and the trail can be changed.</p>
<p>A torsion bar spring (D) is placed between the two top plates and
the two bottom plates to act as the centering spring. It is generally
hat-shaped, with the vertical parts, which are parallel to the head
axis, acting as torsion bars. The active length is thus the sum of the
vertical lengths.</p>

<br />
<h3>RESULTS</h3>

<p>Table 1 lists the input values for the direct-drive recumbent bike.
These values are based on the variable geometry frame and may, of
course, differ in a possible future production bike. Also the mass of
the front assembly will probably be less than the measured 19.5 kg
(including feet) with a production bike. It is unlikely, however, that
the front assembly mass will ever be much less than 15kg for an adult
rider. Measurements were taken from an actual rider, (male, 1.83m tall,
89 kg) so these will also vary.</p>

<h3>PEDAL FORCE FEEDBACK ANALYSIS</h3>

<h3>Steering torque variation with crank position</h3>
<p>The pedal force feedback varies as the crank rotates. Figure 9
shows a typical variation with crank position. The head angle is 62
degrees to the horizontal (author's bike - figure 1). Note that the
zero degree position is when the right crank is aligned with the head
angle, and facing downward and forward.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig11.gif" alt="Figure 11" /><br />Figure 9: Torque vs. crank angle</p>
<p>Figure 9 indicates that the pedaling torque feedback to the
handlebars follows an approximately sinusoidal curve, with a maximum
value when the right pedal crank is oriented at about 120 degrees
counterclockwise (CCW) from the inclination of the head axis. There is
a considerable flat portion of the curve extending from 120 to 150
degrees. Since the head angle in figure 11 is 62 degrees to the
horizontal, this range is from 2 to 32 degrees after the top vertical
position in the normal clockwise sense of the rotation of the right
crank.</p>

<h3><br />Maximum steering torque due to pedaling</h3>

<p>The severity of the pedal force feedback can be expressed as the
maximum torque generated about the steering axis for each 360 degree
rotation of the cranks. Figure 10 depicts this torque as a function of
the head angle, when only the components acting in the plane of
rotation of the cranks are included (in-plane only), and when all the
components are included (all components). The out-of-plane forces are
of a double benefit to the direct-drive recumbent designer: they reduce
the force feedback and increase the effectiveness of reducing the head
angle. This out-of-plane effect is predominately due to the outward
lateral force which is generally in phase with the principal pedal
force.The outward lateral pedal force arises from the direction
applied by the rider's foot to the pedal. The line of this force passes
through the center of pressure of the rider's body on the seat,
creating an outward component at the pedals. </p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig12.gif" alt="Figure 12" /><br />Figure 10: Peak torque vs. head angle</p>

<p>Figure 11 illustrates the peak torque around the steering axis
expressed as a percentage of the peak torque applied to the crank axis.
This gives a sense of how much of the torque required for propelling
the bike is returned to the handlebars. &nbsp;As shown, shallow head
angles can reduce this to a little less than 20 percent.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig13.gif" alt="Figure 13" /><br />Figure 11: Peak torque as a function of peak pedaling torque</p>
<p>Figure 12 depicts the peak restraining force per hand expressed as a
percentage of the peak pedal force. This figure shows that the peak
restraining force per hand can be as low as 13% of the peak applied
pedal force. This underscores that riding a direct-drive recumbent is
not a tug-of-war between the rider's legs and arms&#8212;the force
transmitted back to each hand is about an order of magnitude less than
that applied to the pedals.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig16.gif" alt="Figure 16" /><br />Figure 12: Peak restraining force per hand as a percentage of peak pedal force</p>

<h3><br />Comparing to other moving bottom bracket (MBB) bikes</h3>
<p>It is instructive to compare the direct-drive recumbent with other
recumbent bikes with moving bottom brackets (MBB). These other designs
usually have a bottom bracket mounted generally above and in front of
the front wheel, with a chain extending back to a front hub or
derailleur gear. Examples are the Flevobike, Cruzbike&#8482;, Python (see
Openbike (2008)), and bicycles developed by Tom Traylor (see for
example United States design patent D277,744). Compared to a
direct-drive recumbent, the steering axis is much further behind the
pedals and thus the lateral outward pedal forces have a greater
leverage around the steering axis, leading to reduced pedal force
feedback. The distance from the steering axis to the bottom bracket can
be in the range of 40-50 cm.</p>
<p>Figure 13 compares the pedal force feedback of two chain-driven MBB
bikes with that of the direct-drive recumbent. The first chain-driven
MBB bike is typical of a full size wheel (700C) configuration, with a
steering axis to the bottom bracket distance of 47 cm. The large front
wheel dictates a high bottom bracket and thus a recumbent angle of 73
degrees is typical (bottom bracket at hip pivot height). The second
chain-driven MBB bike is typical of the small front wheel design, with
a low bottom bracket giving a recumbent angle of 53 degrees and a
steering axis to the bottom bracket distance of 40 cm. An above seat
handlebar position similar to that of the direct-drive recumbent is
assumed for both designs.</p>
<p>Comparing the curves in figure 13, a chain-driven MBB bike has a
considerably lower (about one third) restraining force than a
direct-drive recumbent, except in the very shallow head angle range
where the poor leverage in the plane of the outstretched arms overrules.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig20.gif" alt="Figure 20" /><br />Figure 13: Direct-drive compared to chain-driven MBB bikes</p>

<br />
<h3>HANDLING ANALYSIS</h3>

<h3>Trail as a function of head angle</h3>
<p>Figure 14 shows trail as a function of head angle as calculated. The
trail of the front wheel varies very little in the head angle range of
interest (52 to 62 degrees). This also agrees with the 2-3 cm proposed
by Kretschmer (2000) for shallow head angles.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig21.gif" alt="Figure 21" /><br />Figure 14: Trail vs. head angle</p>

<h3><br />Centering spring constant vs head angle</h3>
<p>Figure 15 depicts the spring constant for the centering spring as a function of head angle, as calculated.</p>
<p>The centering spring rate increases rapidly with decreasing head
angle. For example, the spring rate required for a 50 degree head angle
is double that of a 62 degree head angle. This illustrates the
importance of a centering spring as the head angle gets shallower.</p>
<p class="figlbl"><img src="fig22.gif" alt="Figure 22" /><br />Figure 15: Spring rate vs. head angle</p>

<br />
<h3>EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS</h3>

<p>The results of the test runs are of necessity somewhat subjective.
The rider is the author in each case. The test runs are done using the
variable geometry bike (figure 8) with a front wheel trail
of figure 14 and, except as noted, a centering spring rate of figure 15. The first test (62
degree head angle) is the author's direct-drive bike (figure 1) which
has no centering spring and a trail of 28.6 mm (1.125 in). No clips or cleats were used.</p>
<ul><li><b>62 degree head angle</b> (author's bike of figure 1):&nbsp;</li><ul><li><b>Force feedback</b> is quite manageable, but&nbsp;a secure grip on the handlebars is required most of the time.&nbsp;</li><li><b>High speed tracking</b> (stability) is good, but&nbsp;</li><li><b>hands-free coasting</b> is virtually impossible, with the bike over-controlling (turning more into the fall than required).&nbsp;</li><li><b>Low speed tracking</b>

<br />
<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

<p>Figure 16 presents a convenient way of visualizing the pedal force
feedback results. As shown in the figure, the rider exerts a pedal
force extending in an outward-V from the centre of pressure of the
rider on the seat to the pedals. The angle of this V produces the
outward lateral pedal forces. Clearly, the closer the steering axis is
to the rider's centre of pressure, the lower the resulting pedal force
feedback. This is due to the correspondingly smaller lever arm around the
steering axis as the steering axis approaches the vertex of the V. Thus
the goal of the designer is to minimize the distance L in figure 16.
This is consistent with Openbike (2008), who imply that in order to
avoid any pedal force feedback, the steering axis should be aligned
between the rider's hip pivots. As can readily be seen, the distance L
in figure 16 can be minimized by any of three ways: a) moving the
steering axis further back (i.e. decreasing the trail); b) decreasing
the head angle; and c) increasing the seat height.</p>
<p>Unlike other moving bottom bracket bikes such as the Flevobike, the
direct-drive recumbent designer does not have the luxury of translating
the steering axis back toward the seat to reduce pedal force
feedback&#8212;this would produce too much negative trail. Instead the
designer is left with the approaches above and also the option of increasing the
handlebar width and reducing the tread. Therefore the practical limits
of all these are critical to the design.</p>

<p>From the test runs, it is clear that 56 degrees is the minimum
practical head angle for user-friendly riding. Further reduction slows
the steering response and causes a handlebar motion that is
inconsistent with the plane of the outstretched arms of the rider.</p>

<h3>Maximum seat height</h3>
<p>The maximum seat height is determined by two criteria a) the rider's
feet must still be comfortably placed on the ground, and b) the centre
of mass of the bicycle and rider must remain low enough for effective
braking.</p>
<p>From the author's own riding experience, a compressed seat height of
56 cm ensures that the rider's feet can be placed on the ground without
discomfort. Given the author's size (1.83 m tall, 0.841 m hip pivot to
bottom bracket), this seat height corresponds to a recumbent angle of
53 degrees, where the compressed seat height is defined as 76 mm below
the rider's hip pivot.</p>
<p>Therefore a recumbent angle of 53 degrees is considered to be a good
compromise between rider comfort/safety and reduced pedal force
feedback.</p>

<h3>Maximum handlebar width</h3>
<p>The author's direct-drive recumbent and the variable geometry bike
both have a handlebar width of 465 mm between the handlebar grip
centers. Given an inverted U or W handlebar design, this width could be
increased to 560 mm without being unduly cumbersome. The inverted U or
W shape allows the center of pressure of the hands to be further apart
for a given overall width, and provides greater knee clearance.</p>

<h3>Minimum tread</h3>
<p>A tread value of 297 mm (centre-of pedal to centre-of-pedal) is
based on an adaptation of a commercially available planetary chain ring
unit (Schlumpf Speed-Drive®), so the tread is similar to that of a
regular upright bike with a standard 68 mm wide bottom bracket. It is
not really practical to reduce the tread to less.</p>

<h3>Wheelbase</h3>
<p>Kretschmer suggested a wheelbase of 1200 mm for a direct-drive
recumbent, and Stegmann 1450 mm. The author's direct-drive recumbent
has a wheelbase of 1524 mm, and the variable geometry bike one of 1475
mm. With the shorter wheelbases there may be traction problems on hills
due to the lightly loaded front wheel.</p>

<br />
<h3>CONCLUSION&#8212;RECOMMENDED DESIGN</h3>

<p>Table 3 presents the recommended design parameters for a user
friendly direct-drive recumbent, based on the results of this study.</p>

<p>This design returns only 12% of the peak applied pedal force to each hand of the rider.</p>
<p>The resulting bicycle is shown in Figure 17.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The
fork extends continuously from the front wheel to an integral steerer
tube, to which the inverted-U handlebars are attached.&nbsp;</li><li>An
intermediate tube connecting the fork to the head tube is attached
behind the fork, and located at the lowest possible location on the
fork to ease step-over.&nbsp;</li><li>Both the fork and head tube are
inclined at 56 degrees to provide a simplified perpendicular attachment
for the intermediate tube.&nbsp;</li><li>The head tube contains a torsion bar which is easily exchangeable to give a spring rate adjustment.&nbsp;</li><li>On
the other side of the head tube, the frame follows in the same
direction of the intermediate tube until the bend upward for the seat
support section of the frame. The seat section slopes up at 20 degrees
to give a consistent recumbent angle of 53 degree, regardless of seat
position on the tube.&nbsp;</li><li>Approaching the rear wheel, the frame splits into the rear fork and slopes down to the rear wheel dropouts.&nbsp;</li></ul>
