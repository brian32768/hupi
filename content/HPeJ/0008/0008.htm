  <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Measuring Airspeed on a Bicycle<br>
  </h2>
  <small>Julian Gordon<br>
  February 22, 2005</small><br>
  <br>
  <p>Bicycle computers have reached a very sophisticated level considering their
  recent ancestry as the simple cyclometer. Top of the line models now measure
  speed, altitude, temperature, pulse rate, and power meters are also available
  (ref 1). However, at this time, the only practical way of measuring wind
  effects is in a wind tunnel. Wind effects and drag are important in
  determining how much energy one is expending, and clearly it would be
  advantageous to have real time-determination.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Airspeed determination is also critical to avionics, and methods of
  determination have been established since the ‘20’s. See for example ref.
  2. I initially considered the avionics experience would be a valuable
  precedent, and the Pitot-static method has the advantages that (a) there are
  no delicate moving parts (b) and that bicycle computers already utilize an air
  pressure sensor in the form of an altimeter. However, I did not have the
  capability of putting these ideas together in the form of a practical device.
  Also, in order to evaluate a prototype, I needed the capability of downloading
  data into a PC in order to establish the validity of the methodology. Once the
  methodology is established, a real time display will be useful. I found a
  preliminary solution in the form of an anemometer sold for use in
  air-conditioning engineering. This device made by the company Extech has a
  rugged fan-type anemometer device and a display which incorporates a
  data-logger with capability of storing data and downloading to a PC ( fig.
  1).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>It
  is not optimal for use on a bicycle, but could at least prove useful for
  trying out some ideas and establishing proof of principle. I&nbsp; mounted the
  two components on the handlebars alongside my conventional CatEye bicycle
  computer to measure speed and distance in parallel. Thus, the anemometer gives
  a reading of apparent or indicated airspeed (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span>)
  and the bicycle computer routinely measures and displays groundspeed (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gs</span>).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> is not the same as the airspeed
  some distance from the bicycle because to get this, the device would have to
  be mounted clear of any parts of the bicycle influencing the air flow. This is
  obvious from over 80 years of avionics practice, where the Pitot tube is
  mounted ahead of the leading edge of a wing and clear of any fuselage parts
  that may disturb the airflow. Nevertheless, if there were a monotonic
  relationship between <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> and the
  undisturbed airspeed one would be able to derive one from the other by
  applying a correction factor. Thus we call this airspeed the corrected
  airspeed or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span>. Ideally, in the
  absence of wind,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Cas = Gs</b> [equation 1]</p>
  <p>Such a condition seldom occurs in practice, especially not in the Chicago
  area.</p>
  I decided to attempt to average out the effect of wind by selecting a
  straight, relatively sheltered course of about 1 km, and making the assumption
  that wind effects would average out by being equal and opposite when
  traversing the course successively in opposite directions. Thus, I took the
  pairwise averages of the average <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gs</span>
  and average <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> in each direction,
  repeating this at speeds ranging from the lowest compatible with biking
  stability to the fastest I could go. In the following the averages are denoted
  as &lt;Gs&gt;, &lt;Ias&gt; and &lt;Cas&gt;.<br>
  I set out to determine whether the averaging gave &lt;Gs&gt; as a reproducible
  and monotonic function of &lt;Ias&gt;:
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>&lt;Gs&gt; = f(&lt;Ias&gt;)</b> [equation 2]</p>
  <p>If that were the case, then the function can be used in a calibration
  procedure, and permit the determination of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span>
  from any observed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias.</span></p>
  <p>In practice, I obtained linear relationships between &lt;Ias&gt; and
  &lt;Gs&gt;, similar for similar bicycle types, and also reproducible when done
  under relatively calm conditions or relatively gusty conditions. This first
  set of data with three riders and three bicycle models is summarized in Table.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;In practice, it is then a simple procedure to obtain <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span>
  by multiplying <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> by the slope of
  that linear regression. I had thus collected enough data with a non-optimal
  device to convince myself that, in principle, an anemometer device could be
  used for routine <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span> determination.</p>
  <p>About
  this time, a device came on the market, which could be more practical. This
  was a handheld weather station, the ADC (&quot;Atmospheric Data Center&quot;)
  Summit sold in the US by Brunton and in Europe by the parent company Silva.
  See Fig 2. It measures temperature, altitude, barometric pressure, windspeed
  and even compass direction. It has the capability of collecting data and
  downloading to a PC via an ir port. It also comes with a lanyard strap. I
  removed the strap and used the slot to attach the device to the handlebars
  with cable ties. The advances over the Extech device are:</p>
  <p>1. One unit to mount instead of two<br>
  2. More compact<br>
  3. Easy mounting.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>A disadvantage appears to lie in the fact, that, in order to face the frontal
  wind squarely, it needs to be mounted vertically. In this position,
  the display is almost unreadable. I therefore investigated the effect of tilt
  angle. Surprisingly, the regression curve was not&nbsp; significantly different
  between the vertical position, and a 45 degree tilted position, where the
  display is easily readable. These results are shown plotted in Fig 3. Finally,
  the bicycle-to-bicycle variation is much smaller than for the Extech, Fig 4.<p>&nbsp;

  <p>&nbsp;<p>To
  a first approximation, it may be possible to have a universal <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span>
  to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span> correction factor built into a
  device, so one would not necessarily have to perform the calibration procedure
  described for every individual bicycle. This would be analogous to the wheel
  circumference measurement for a bicycle computer. One can input standard
  values for specified tires, or, the more fastidious user can determine the
  circumference directly.
  <p>In summary, my experience to date shows no reason why one cannot have a
  bicycle computer that will measure airspeed by very simple means. My plans are
  to use it to determine drag coefficients when I get out again in warmer
  weather, and also to persuade some bicycle computer company to incorporate
  airspeed measurement as an adjunct to the other functions of a standard
  bicycle computer. Then, for example, a real time display of the difference
  between <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gs</span>
  will give an objective measurement of whether wind is favorably or adversely
  affecting performance.</p>
  <p>The material in this paper has been filed as part of a US Provisional and
  an International Patent Application, which will be published later this year.
  The patent applications include more extensive data.</p>
