  <h2>Introduction</h2>
​
  <p>While windsurfers routinely oscillate their sails (a process known
as “sail pumping”) to increase speed in light winds or to provide a
burst of acceleration to hasten the transition to planing, sail pumping
has been the topic of research only in the context of the physiological
response to the pumping. No research that we are aware of has been
conducted on the efficiency of pumping sails.</p>
  <p>As environmental concerns become more important, sail or airfoil
pumping may become a viable method of propelling future sailing ships
when wind conditions are light. Once wind conditions are stronger, the
foils could be
used as sails. <br>
  </p>
  <p>In this work we investigate the efficiency of human-powered sail
pumping in zero wind conditions using a windsurfer sail and mast/boom
assembly mounted on a wheeled cart, as shown below. The sail
is
not completely rigid and the top part twists as it is pumped.<small>
[This automatically gives the shape of a
propeller blade to some extent and is appropriate, as during the
stroke the sail momentarily acts as a one-bladed propeller. Ed.]</small><br>
  </p>
  <p>The bottom of the mast is attached to the platform using a
windsurfer
articulated joint, and the mast <span style="font-style: italic;">rolls</span>
from side to side to provide
translational motion to the sail, which also simultaneously <span
 style="font-style: italic;">yaws</span> about the mast.<br>
  </p>

The general term “wing” will be used to denote what is being
oscillated: a sail, fin, airfoil or flipper.<br>

  <br>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">There are two general
types of stroking methods: oscillation and flapping. In oscillating
motion, the
wing is attached to the body at its leading edge, as in the tail fins
of fish, whales and dolphins. In flapping motion, as in bird wings or
the the
fins of sea turtles, the wing is attached to the body at its root or
base. Sail
pumping involves flapping since the mast is attached to the base of the
sail.&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The pitch Θ (Theta) of the sail is the angle of the wing relative
to the direction of vehicle motion <small>[not to be confused by the
pitch angle of the rig relative to the ground, Ed.]</small>, while α
(alpha) is the angle
of the wing into the resultant flow due to the translational motion of
the wing and the forward motion
of the vehicle, as shown below. The angle α is referred to as the angle
of attack of the wing. <br>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="width: 553px; height: 471px;" alt="fig 3" src="fig3.jpg"><br>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>​<br>
The translational displacement of the wing is referred to as
heave
h, and has a value of zero at the midpoint of the foil’s translation.
The maximum heave is denoted by h₀ and represents one half of the total
amplitude of the foil translation at a given point. The heave is
normally measured at
the leading edge of the wing (the center of rotation or pivoting or
yawing axis). The parameter h₀/c is used
in this and other studies as a dimensionless parameter for the heave, c
being the wing's chord (= its width as viewed from the side).</p>
  <p>The phase angle φ is an important parameter, and describes the
difference in phase between the pitch of the wing Θ as it leads the
heave of the foil h. A phase angle of 0 degrees results in the heave
and pitch angle reaching their maximum values at the same time (the end
of the stroke), while a 90 degree phase angle results in the wing at
its minimum angle when the heave reaches its maximum at the end of a
stroke.<br>
  </p>
  <p>An important parameter is the Strouhal number St, given by:</p>
  <p><i>St = f A / V</i><br>
  </p>
  <p>Where f is the frequency of oscillation of the wing, A is the
amplitude
of the stroke, usually measured at the point of the foil rotation, and
V is the speed of the craft. The Strouhal number can also be thought of
as half of the ratio of the average translational speed of the wing to
the speed of the craft.<br>
  </p>
Since the mast and sail in this work are rolling in an arc about the
bottom of the mast, the amplitude of oscillation of each point
depends
on the height over the bottom. The sail thus experiences a range of
Strouhal numbers. For the purposes of this study we will report the
Strouhal number using the amplitude at 0.7 times the sail height or
span, as this was the method used in the flapping foil literature to
capture properties at the center of effort of the sail. <br>
  <br>
In addition to the amplitude measured at the leading edge of the sail,
one may consider a Strouhal number measured at its trailing edge:<br>
  <p><i>St<sub>TE</sub> = f A<sub>TE</sub> /
V</i> </p>
which uses the maximum translational amplitude A of the foil occurring
at the trailing edge of the foil. Studies of Strouhal numbers made on
aquatic animals and birds typically use this version of St. <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Previous work</h2>
D.A. Read, F.S. Hover and others (see references in <a
 href="HumanPoweredSailPumpingV7.pdf">complete article</a>) have
found that computer-controlled rigid <span style="font-style: italic;">oscillating</span>
foils can achieve high propulsive efficiencies - we stress that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">flapping</span>
foils are different. J.M. Anderson and others found even higher
efficiencies: 86%
at St = 0.3, as compared to 72% at St = 0.16 for Read and 64% for Hover
at St= 0.25. <br>
  <br>
They also discovered that the maximum heave to chord (h₀/c)
ratios they tested (1.0 for Read and Hover, and 0.75 for Anderson)
resulted in peak efficiencies, as did maximum angles of attack α
between 15 and 20 degrees.&nbsp; In addition, they found that a peak in
the efficiency is found when the phase angle is around 90 degrees.
These xperiments performed with the foil
heaving linearly, with end caps at the foil tips to simulate an
infinite aspect ratio.<br>
  <br>
Hover experimented with a variety of stroke-timing schemes,
concluding that controlling the foil angle of attack with a sine
function (as opposed to controlling the pitch angle with a sine
function) gives optimal results.&nbsp; Read found that the lateral
forces could be up to 4 times greater than the generated thrust forces.<br>
  <br>
For foils undergoing flapping motion (more similar to the windsurfer
rig), V. Polidoro found that a foil aspect ratio of about 4
provided optimal thrust.&nbsp; S.C. Licht and others discovered that
flapping motion with additional forwards and backwards movement can
result in significant
increase in efficiency at maximum angles of attack of 40 degrees. The
motion involves a thrust producing stroke downstream and a feathered
stroke upstream, and mimics the stroking of sea turtles.<br>
  <br>
Nature also appears to pay close attention to the Strouhal number.
G.S. Triantafyllou, J.J. Rohr, G. Taylor and others reported that
dolphins, sharks, bony fish, birds, bats and insects, swim or cruise at
0.2&nbsp;
&lt; <i>St<sub>TE </sub></i>&lt; 0.4.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <h2>Methods</h2>
Experiments were conducted using a Gaastra 6.5 m² windsurfing sail
mounted on a large skateboard using a conventional windsurfer mast and
wishbone boom rig. The resulting oscillations classify as flapping. Due
to the twisting of the top portion of the sail the behaviour is
different than with rigid folis. The sail height is 4.5 m, and the
chord length at its widest point is 1.7 m, with an
average chord of 1.1 m. The sails's aspect ratio is 4.1 and its center
of effort (CE) is located 2 m over the deck, the same as its centroid
height at 44%.<br>
  <br>
Experiments were first conducted on a windsurfer, but we found that the
side lift forces caused considerable
periodic yawing which adversely affected efficiency. Rather than
modifying the windsurfer board in order to minimize this effect, we
decided to conduct our experiments on land, using a large skateboard
constructed for this purpose. <br>
  <h4>Power needed for propulsion</h4>
We determined the total drag force (rolling resistance plus air
resistance) of the board and rider by measuring the tension on a spring
scale pulled by a bicycle at various speeds over a wooden gymnasium
floor. The tests were performed with the rider on the board, without
the sail rig. The drag force from the sail rig was calculated by
treating the rig as a vertical cylinder with a drag coefficient (Cd) of
1, using the average diameter of the mast. The figure below shows the
drag
force of the board and rider with and without the sail, as a function
of constant-velocity values obtained after acceleration. It shows the
total drag force results for pilot 1 (1.83m (6 ft), 77 kg (170
lb))
with and without the sail rig, as a function of speed. The error in
measuring the drag force was probably around ±5%. The data for the
total drag are well-fit by a 2nd degree polynomial:&nbsp; Drag (N) ~
1.8 - 0.092 V + 1.9 V²&nbsp; (V in m/s).<br>
  <br>
The power in W at any given point of the curve is simply the drag times
the velocity or ~ 1.8 V - 0.092 V² + 1.9 V³&nbsp; (V in m/s).<br>

  </div>
  <h4>Human power calculated via force and movement measurements<br>
  </h4>
  <p>We measured force applied to the windsurfer boom by a pressure
sensor connected to an inflated bladder (see photo below). As force was
applied to
the bladder, a laptop computer carried on the pilot’s back recorded
pressure readings
every 0.003 seconds. The sensor was calibrated by hanging weights from
the bladder.
The sensitivity of the instrument depended on the inflation pressure,
and a
pressure of ~128 kPa (18.5
psig) was found to be adequate.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Bladder for measuring force
applied by pilot, attached to the boom. In this configuration the pilot
pushes on the bladder for the stroke. For measuring the pulling stroke,
the bladder
is mounted on the inside of the boom.</blockquote>
  <br>
Only one sensor was used, secured to the boom at a position where one
of the pilot’s hands would grip.&nbsp; For each of 4 runs, the sensor
location was moved and four sets of data taken (each left and right
hands in
push and pull configurations). The power input to the boom was
calculated as force multiplied by the stroke velocity. <br>
  <br>
The windsurfer rig rotates about the roll and yaw axes while
oscillating back and forth. We used the gyroscope sensors of a
smartphone to measure yaw and roll of the rig, with a SensorLog app for
processing and displaying the data. The sensor output was tested
against measurements made with slow motion videos of sail pumping, as
well as experiments in which the yaw and roll were simultaneously
changed through arcs of the same magnitude encountered in our runs. The
sensor values were found to be well within 5 degrees of measured
angles. Data were collected at a sampling rate of 30 Hz and uploaded to
a PC after a run was complete.<br>
  <br>
The yaw data from the sensors were used directly to calculate the pitch
angle Θ. The heave (translational position of the sail) was calculated
by simple geometry relating the roll angle to displacement. The
translational velocity of the sail was calculated by computing the
time-dependent change in heave readings.
The angle of attack was calculated at each sampling time by finding the
resultant of the incoming air speed into the board and the
translational velocity of the foil.<br>
  <br>
  <h4>Human power estimated from heart rate</h4>
We also measured pilot power output by measuring heart rates. J. Achten
and A.
Jeukendrup report that the heart rate can be a reliable method of
determining human power output, but care must be taken to avoid
“cardiac drift”, where the heart rate increases after 5-10 minutes of
uninterrupted exertion. H. Hilliskorpi et al. showed that the mode
of the exertion was not important –
heart rate measurements from hand cranking, pedaling or rowing should
give similar power results. We confirmed this by comparing the power
output from a cycling dynamometer with that from an elliptical trainer
using hand and leg motion, resulting in virtually identical power
results from the same heart rates. We measured the
relationship between power output and heart rate for the pilots using
two Matrix exercise bicycles having an accuracy specified by
the manufacturer to be within 5%. The figure below shows the
relationship between human power
output and heart rate for two of the three pilots used for the study. <br>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 71%; height: 71%;"
 alt="fig 6" src="fig6.png"><br>
  </div>
The figure below shows the heart rate-estimated power of Pilot 2 as a
function of stroking speed and cart velocity. Other pilots had very
similar results. <small>[It is also seen that a minimum of 75 W is
required to achieve a speed of 1.685 m/s and that faster stroking
increases the speed but at a lower efficiency. Ed.]</small><br>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 71%; height: 71%;"
 alt="fig 13" src="fig13.png"><br>
  </div>
None of the pilots was aware of his Strouhal number at the time the
experiments were conducted. The pilots were not world-class athletes,
but individuals in fairly good physical condition. Pilots 1 and 3 were
about 20 years of age, and the age of pilot 2 about 3 times that.<br>
  <br>
All the pilots experienced some initial difficulties learning to stroke
properly and practiced about one half to one hour over several
sessions. Stroking the sail was hard work at the
beginning, with resulting heart rates over 150 beats per minute (~200
W). After some experience, the pilots were able to stroke in a more
relaxed mode, with typical sail pumping heart rates between 106 –120
beats per minute (~50-100 W).<br>
  <br>
  <h2>Results</h2>
The efficiency η (eta) of propulsion with stroking is defined as: η =
propulsive power needed / human power needed<br>
  <br>
The power needed for propulsion is the thrust times the vehicle
velocity. The thrust was assumed equal to the drag measured at the same
time as this velocity. <br>
  <br>
Using the heart rate result of 75 W needed to achieve 1.685 m/s (pilot
2) and the power required for propulsion at this speed of 11.85 W (from
the polynominal fit equation), this gives η = 11.85 / 75 = 15.8 %.<br>
  <br>
In a similar manner, the efficiency using sensor data is calculated,
the human power being the force measured by the bladder sensor times
the
velocity at this instant. Averaging over the strokes of the four runs
(one each pulling and pushing for the left and the right arm), the data
of pilot 2 give 17.8 %.<br>
  <br>
The results for two pilots are summarized below, and show that the
efficiencies measured using the heart rate are within 15% of those
measured using the sensor. This is an important finding for further
tests that may be conducted on the water, because of the ease with
which heart rate data can be taken.<br>

The table shows that the pilots stroked nearly in the range of&nbsp; as
found in nature (0.2&lt; St<sub>TE</sub>&lt;0.4 (Taylor
(2003)), a range shown to be the most efficient, and in the same range
of phase angle found efficient in Anderson, Read, and Hover. <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Froude efficiency</h4>
We now
address the efficiency results, which are quite low compared to the
maximum efficiencies cited in the literature for oscillating and
flapping foils. Using a hot-wire anemometer, we measured the maximum
speed of the air exiting the sail as 4 m/s relative to the board, with
the board moving at 2.25 m/s relative to the ground, at about 1-2 m
behind the sail and 2 m above the deck. From this we calculate the
Froude efficiency:<br>
  <br>
η<sub>Froude</sub> = 1 / (1 + 0.5
(V<sub>increase through propulsor </sub>/ V<sub>board</sub>)) = 72 %<br>
  <br>
The Froude efficiency assumes frictionless flow and
considers only the inherent kinetic energy
losses behind the propulsor. The equation shows that a propulsor is
most
efficient when it increases the speed of the incoming fluid as little
as possible. According to Stinton(1984),
modern aircraft propellers can achieve efficiencies of about 0.8
times the Froude efficiency <small>[propellers for human powered
aircraft even over 0.9. Ed.]</small>, which suggests that our sail
pumping could reach an efficiency of about 58 % on this basis. It is
clear that with sail pumping there are irreversibilties that cannot be
attributed to
excess exit velocities. It appears that the phase angle, exit velocity
and Strouhal number can be eliminated as possible causes for the low
efficiencies, and we next address the maximum angle of
attack. [for this see <a href="HumanPoweredSailPumpingV7.pdf">complete
article</a>]<br>
  <br>
  <h4>Efficiency vs. St and h<sub>o</sub>/c</h4>
The figure below shows the results from various experimental runs in
which the stroking style was varied. They include very slow stroking,
stroking with a feathering return, stroking with more exaggerated
pitch, and normal stroking. A peak in the efficiency can be seen at
Strouhal number of 0.3 for the normal stroking of Pilot 2.
This peak is similar to that found in the literature results at about
the same Strouhal number.<br>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
It is at first glance remarkable that the pilots naturally stroked
at St<sub>TE</sub> values (0.4 and 0.5) very close to those used in
nature (0.2 to 0.4
with efficiency peaking at about 0.3). Humans and animals seem to
naturally find this "sweet spot". While it may be tempting to attribute
this to some form of primordial connection between humans
and animals, the reason that humans stroke in the most efficient range
is probably that we feel subtle feedback as we stroke. If St gets
too high or too low we work harder, and the body may sense the
difference.<br>
  <br>
G.S. Triantafyllou et al. also showed that the preferred St range has a
theoretical basis. They demonstrated that optimal stroking efficiencies
are achieved at foil oscillation frequencies that result in maximum
amplification of the unstable average wake behind the foil, which
occurred at 0.25&lt; St<sub>TE</sub>&lt; 0.35. The authors also showed
that many fish species stroked in exactly this
range.<br>
  <br>
See the <a href="HumanPoweredSailPumpingV7.pdf">complete article</a>
for further discussion.<br>
  <br>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
Human-powered sail pumping efficiencies of nearly 20% were measured at
Strouhal numbers of 0.3 and 0.4 (at 0.7 of the mast height and the
leading edge) and 0.4 and 0.5 (at the trailing edge). This is about in
the St range considered
efficient in the literature as well as that used by animals in nature.<br>
  <br>
The low efficiencies of human-powered sail pumping (compared to the
maximum efficiencies measured in the flapping foil literature of about
80%) can be attributed to several factors manifested during the
testing: high maximum angles of attack, low heave to chord ratios, and
the poor aerodynamics of a sail compared to a rigid foil.<br>
  <br>
The heave to chord ratio may be improved to some degree by using a sail
with a smaller chord. The aerodynamics and maximum angle of attack can
also be modified. We estimate that it may be possible to achieve
efficiencies of about 70% using a rigid wing and the proper angle of
attack.<br>
  <br>
Our results show that operating in the correct Strouhal number range
does not necessarily preclude inefficient operation. The twist in a
sail during pumping may be beneficial as in the case of the tests
performed here, it brought the angle of attack near the top of the sail
into an efficient range. However, the angle of attack near the center
of effort of the sail ​​​​​​​​​​(where there is little or no twist) was
too high.<br>
  <br>
The heart rate of the pilots was found to give power input readings
that were within 15% of readings taken using an electronic force-data
acquisition system. This is a very useful finding, especially when
measurements need to be performed on the water or anywhere electronic
equipment is impractical.<br>
  <br>
We are in the process of building a rigid sail to determine if sail
pumping efficiency can be improved. Our goal is to eventually construct
a small boat to test sail pumping under marine conditions and low wind
speeds. It is hoped that sail pumping will be more efficient as an
auxiliary power source for sailboats in light wind
conditions than conventional marine propellers.<br>
