[Editorial introduction by David Gordon Wilson: The first known pedaled
bicycles came from France around the middle of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; They had pedals at the ends of cranks connected
directly to the front wheels.&nbsp; Thus the pedal motion was
circular, and almost all the billions of bicycles that have been made
since then have followed this lead. Chain drives came in the 1880s that
preserved the linear relationship between the distance moved by the
pedal and and by the wheel-rim.&nbsp; At different times people
have experimented with non-circular chain-wheels aimed at producing
more power from human legs. Some strong claims were made but these were
never proved in careful tests, and they have not been adopted by
bicycle racers. At a time close to 1890 someone in Germany produced a
system in which the pedals moved along an oval path.&nbsp; This has
been revived in Britain as the "K Drive", and races of streamlined
human-powered vehicles have been won using this drive. A contributor to
the journal Human Power thought that the good results were more because
the oval motion allowed better streamlining than because of any
increased power output from the riders. Again, no experimental data
have been published. However, such data have been taken comparing
rotary pedalling with linear rowing motions using hands and feet, and
increased power for short periods has been demonstrated.&nbsp; We
suspect that the additional power comes from the contribution of the
arm muscles, which have been found to add between ten and twenty
percent to the maximum power that can be produced when rotary arm
cranking is added to rotary pedaling. Beautiful recumbent bicycles
using hand-and-foot linear and arcuate motions have been made by the
Thys brothers in The Netherlands and used in "class" races. I have not
seen comparative race or test data between this class of bicycle and
others.]<br>

Introduction</h3>


&nbsp;In the drives currently used for bicycles and recumbents, the
riders&rsquo; power is not effectively utilized because the
direction of
the force applied to the pedal differs from that of
the crank normal at almost all the crank angles except a limited
region,
as shown in Fig. 1 below. This is a clock diagram of a well
trained cyclist of a standard bicycle, illustrating the actual and
effective forces applied to a pedal. The actual forces
exhibit appreciable magnitude in the wide region of crank angles
between about&nbsp;90 and 210 degrees from the top, whereas the
tangential
components of the actual forces, i.e. effective forces, coincide with
the actual forces only in more limited regions of crank angles. <br>


All&nbsp;the forces in these regions act mainly downward. It might
be
thought that centrifugal forces take part in this, however you can
easily realize that the magnitude of the centrifugal
forces does not change greatly during the pedal revolutions.&nbsp;<br>


Thus, the actual forces measured relate mainly to muscular actions and
it is presumed that the direction of force which an individual, even a
trained
cyclist, can apply to a pedal, is not in the direction of rotation
but mostly straight downward. Fig. 2 below is a a corresponding force
effectiveness pattern.&nbsp;
    <br>

    <a href="sdv-ani.gif"><i><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 280px; height: 280px; float: left;" target="_blank" alt="image of SDV drive" src="sdv.gif" hspace="20"></i></a>If the direction of the
motion of a pedal in its power phase is
designed to coincide with the direction in which a rider can most
easily apply force to the pedal while stretching his or her legs, and
if there is least loss of momentum at both ends of pedal
travel,&nbsp; without
delayed reapplication of force at the beginning of the
power phase, it is expected that the energy transmission efficiency
from the rider to the machine would increase appreciably. <br>


    <br>


We can derive a more desirable force effectiveness pattern as shown in
Fig. 4 from Fig.
2 by stretching the peaks. Then we obtain Fig. 3 corresponding to Fig.
1 of the conventional drive, which we can call an
oval clock diagram of the SDV drive. The radii of two circles are the
same
and smaller than that of Fig. 1. A mechanism comprised of two sprockets
and a chain is introduced to realize Fig. 3 in practice. Fig. 4 was
prepared
assuming such a combination of two sprockets with 39 teeth and a looped
chain comprised of 76 links those of which are available as bicycle
components. Click on the drawing to the left from the&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bike-sdv.com/">bike-sdv.com</a>

In Fig. 3, if A &ndash; B&nbsp;, the direction of force applied
to the
pedal coincides closely with that of the motion of the pedal
in the power phase. The area S of Fig. 4 is 1.35 times of S in Fig. 1,
which means that a SDV drive represented by Fig. 4 delivers 1.35 times
larger output power than that of a conventional drive represented by
Fig. 1, assuming that pedal speeds are equal in both the drives.

    <h3>Measurement of force patterns</h3>


    <img style="width: 600px; height: 450px; float: left;" alt="figure 5" src="fig5.jpg" hspace="8">Fig.
5 shows tests with a
SDV bicycle Alpha-ls at Waseda University. The rear
wheel was exchanged for the flywheel of an ergometer.
The pedal forces were measured by piezoelectric instruments. The saddle
position allows the rider to move the foot along the chain.
The seat post angle is
86 degrees and the pedal path angle 71 degrees&nbsp;from the
ground.
The two sprockets have 39 teeth and the chain 70 links. The total
length of the track is 889
mm and the total stroke 355 mm. The pedal cranks are 170 mm giving a
circular pedal path of 1068 mm. <br>


    <br>


    <br>


Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show the force&nbsp;versus
pedal location for a student pedaling at 200 W, 60 rpm with
conventional and SDV drives, respectively. On the x - axis
0 and 100 are the top position of the pedal. The y- axis shows the
force in Newtons.&nbsp;
    
    <p><img style="width: 500px; height: 348px;" alt="figure 6" src="fig6.png"></p>


    
    <p><img style="width: 500px; height: 337px;" alt="figure 7" src="fig7.png"> </p>


When comparing the areas beneath the curves of effective force, the
area of Fig. 7 is larger. The ratio of these areas is inversely
proportional to
the ratio of the pedal paths of both drives as the output powers
and pedal rpms are kept equal. In Fig. 6, the applied and effective
forces coincide at 23% as in Fig. 1. In Fig. 7, they overlap from 14 %
to 42 %, corresponding to the
rectilinear portion of the oval track. Comparing Fig. 4 with
Fig. 7, in the latter the forces increase more
gradually,
corresponding to the knee
being extended. A sharper increase is possible by using larger
sprockets such as with 42 or 43 teeth.
    
    <h3><br>


Local maximum output power (LMP)</h3>


    
    <p>To find out the difference in output powers between a SDV
and a
conventional drive, a local maximum output power (LMP) against
cadences&nbsp;for a certain heart rate was searched for both the
SDV
drive and
conventional drive by employing a mechanical ergometer, thus obtaining
sets of LMPs for different heart rates.
Two test subjects, an experienced cyclist and non-cyclist, were
involved in the experiments.&nbsp; LMPs versus heart rates of the
subjects were chosen as the criterion for comparing the performance of
the drives.&nbsp; Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the obtained LMPs versus
heart
rates for the non cyclist and the experienced cyclist
respectively.&nbsp; Logarithmic approximation lines are added. <small>[for
derivations and full results see <a href="Closed-form-Vmax-bike.pdf">full
paper</a>, Ed.]</small></p>


    <img style="width: 500px; height: 316px;" alt="figure 8" src="fig8.png"><img style="width: 500px; height: 306px;" alt="figure 9" src="fig9.png"><br>


    
    <p> The duration of each experiment was two minutes. Each
experiment was started with stabilized&nbsp;heart rate after having
warmed up. It took them about two weeks to obtain
relatively stabilized data both for the conventional and SDV drives. In
Fig. 8, the data was obtained in three days and those for the
conventional
drive were obtained in five days. The cadences varied from 21.5 rpm to
35.1 rpm as heart rate increased and
those for the conventional one vary from 22.6 rpm to 65.6 rpm. In Fig.
9, the data was
obtained in two days and for the conventional drive&nbsp;
in one day. The cadences for LMPs of the SDV drive vary from 20.8 rpm
to
38 rpm as heart rate increases and those for the conventional one vary
from 35.3 rpm to 88.9 rpm as heart rate increases.&nbsp;</p>


    
    <p>Judging from the plotted points:<br>


    </p>


    
    <ol>


      <li>At lower heart rate regions, the LMPs of the SDV drive
are 1.5
&ndash; 1.8 times of those of the conventional drive,</li>


      <li>At higher heart rate regions, the LMPs of the SDV drive
are 1.1
&ndash; 1.2 times of those of the conventional drive. Using the
logarithmic approximation lines, the LMPs of the SDV
drive are 1.2 &ndash; 1.4 times of those of the conventional drive.</li>


    
    </ol>


    
    <h3><br>


Discussion and conclusion</h3>


    
    <p>When comparing LMPs versus heart rates for both systems,
the
SDV
drive delivers more power than the conventional drive.&nbsp; As
heart
rate has a close correlation with energy expenditure of an individual,
the above conclusion is valid from the standpoint of gross efficiency
which
is the ratio of useful work performed to energy expenditure. <br>


There are other estimates of efficiency, one which is termed work
efficiency which is the ratio of the useful work performed to the rest
of the energy expenditure, after subtracting the energy just moving the
legs.&nbsp; According to the gross efficiency, optimum cadences are
very low and according to the work efficiency, optimum cadences are
much higher. In fact, in some racing conditions, riders prefer higher
cadences such as 80 &ndash; 100 rpm for conventional bicycles and
50
-70 rpm for SDV bicycles. These values are much higher than those
obtained at the laboratory tests described in the previous section. It
is also the case that among recreation oriented cyclists there are many
who prefer lower cadences less than 60 rpm even in conventional
bicycles. In the SDV, judging from a limited experience, we feel the
cadences of 50 &ndash; 70 rpm is also the case for recreation
oriented
cyclists.<br>


The reason of lower cadences of the SDV drive than those of the
conventional drive in general are that in SDV you can apply a larger
sustained force to the pedals, resulting in higher ratio of
output power to cadence. We think the geometry of SDV makes riders
use larger muscles, giving lower cadences than we
expected. <br>


Regarding knee joint loads, troubles have not been reported
among about 80 SDV bicycle users.<br>


SDV research and application are just at the threshold. The geometry
has not been optimized yet.&nbsp;We would also like to investigate
the effect of the
direction of the gravity on the riders&rsquo; position. Obtaining
data
on SDV recumbents are another area of interest. </p>
