<blockquote> <b>Introduction</b>
  <br>

  <br>

In order to maximize performance in HPVs, designers need to understand
not only how to minimize&nbsp;friction and drag, but also how to
maximize power production and propulsive forces. A biomechanical model
describing the factors affecting HPV performance was presented (<a target="_blank" href="http://ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp54-2003.pdf">Too
&amp; Landwer, 2003</a>). This model included a flowchart of the: <br>

  
  <ol>

    <li>factors affecting cycling performance; </li>


    <li>environmental factors
contributing to resistive forces, and </li>

    <li>internal biomechanical
factors affecting power and torque production. </li>

  
  </ol>

From the model, it was
determined that the forces, torque, and power produced to propel HPVs
are a function of how internal biomechanical factors (muscle length
with different hip, knee, and ankle angles) interact with external
mechanical factors (seat-tube-angle, seat-to-pedal distance, crank arm
length).<br>




  <br>


The interaction of these internal biomechanical factors with external
mechanical factors was discussed. (<a target="_blank" href="http://ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp55/">Too and Landwer
(2003-2004)</a>). This included a review of muscle
force-length-velocity-power relationships; how muscle force is produced
and modified with changes in joint angles (due to changes in muscle
length); and how changes in seat-tube-angle, seat-to-pedal distance,
and crank arm length affect joint angles and power production, by
changing where, when, and for how long the muscles are active in the
force-length-velocity curve during a pedal cycle.&nbsp;<br>




  <br>




This paper will review, compare and summarize various published
research on both upright and recumbent cycling positions, incorporating
and expanding upon the previous information. This will include a
discussion of the interaction between changes in muscle length and
force production affecting cycling performance due to changes in: <br>

  
  <ol>

    <li>hip angle with changes in seat-tube angle; </li>

    <li>hip, knee, and ankle
angles with changes in seat-to-pedal distance; and </li>


    <li>hip, knee, and
ankle angles with different crank arm lengths. </li>

  
  </ol>

This will also include a
discussion of: <br>

  
  <ol>

    <li>the interaction between crank arm length,
load/resistance, pedaling rate, and work/power output; and </li>

    <li>potential topics and direction for future HPV research in this area.</li>

  
  </ol>

  <b>Seat-Tube-Angle, Hip-Angle, and Cycling Performance</b><br>



  <br>



Based on the force-length relationship, a muscle can produce its
greatest force at its resting length. With increasing or
decreasing distance from resting length, the force a muscle can
produce will decrease. To determine the hip angles (minimum, maximum,
range) during a pedal cycle that would optimize muscle length to
maximize force production (as determined by cycling performance), Too
(1990, 1991) examined the effect of a systematic change in seat-tube
angle on hip angle and cycling performance when other variables were
controlled (i.e., the trunk/seat backrest kept perpendicular to the
ground, and the seat-to-pedal distance maintained at 100% of leg length
as measured from the greater trochanter to the ground). With a
systematic increase in seat-tube angle from 0 to 100 degrees (see
Figure 1<img style="width: 640px; height: 480px; float: right;" alt="" src="Figure1.jpg">), there was a systematic decrease in hip angle (see Figure 2<img style="width: 640px; height: 480px; float: right;" alt="" src="Figure2.jpg">).
It was determined that cycling performance (aerobically and
anaerobically) was maximized in the 75 degree seat-tube-angle, with the
following hip-angles during a pedal cycle (minimum = 55 degrees,
maximum = 97 degrees, range = 42 degrees). The accompanying knee angles
for the aforementioned hip angles were: minimum = 65 degrees, maximum =
142 degrees, range = 77 degrees. It should be noted that these hip and
knee angles are values combined from the angles reported in the aerobic
(Too, 1990) and anaerobic study (Too, 1991). An inverted U shape curve
was found to best describing cycling performance when there is a
systematic increase in seat-tube angle (from 0 to 100 degrees)
resulting in a systematic decrease in mean hip angle (from 131 to 59
degrees). To determine or predict the optimal seat-tube angle and hip
angles (minimum, maximum, range) to maximize cycling performance in a
recumbent position, regression analysis would be required (but was not
undertaken by Too, 1990, 1991), and is certainly a topic for additional
HPV research.<br>



  <br>



If a HPV is to be designed to incorporate these angles (seat-tube, hip,
and knee), the hip position should be located above the crank spindle
(i.e. &ndash; bottom bracket) because Too (1989, 1994) reported cycling
performance, both aerobically and anaerobically, to decrease when the
hip position was located below the crank spindle. It had been
speculated that this decrement in performance may be attributed to: (1)
an additional unmeasured energy requirement related to the extra force
required to overcome a greater portion of the weight of the lower
extremity during a pedal cycle (Too, 1994); (2) a decreased body/leg
weight contribution to the total pedal force applied (Too, 1994); (3)
changes in muscular forces/torques developed and applied to the pedals
(Too, 1994); (4) a change in trunk angle relative to the ground (if the
same hip and knee angles were to be maintained); (5) the use of pedal
toe-clips instead of some other foot-to-pedal interface (Reiser &amp;

Peterson, 1998-1999).<br>



  <br>








  <b><br>



seat-to-pedal distance, Joint Angles, and Cycling Performance</b><br>



  <br>



Unlike changes in seat-tube-angle where only the hip-angle is affected,
changes in seat-to-pedal distance will affect angles of the hip, knee,
and ankle during a pedal cycle. Based on the force-length-relationship,
a more complex interaction occurs between muscle length and force
production when multiple joints and multi-joint muscles that cross the
hip/knee and knee/ankle (e.g., rectus femoris, hamstrings,
gastrocnemius) are involved. From the literature, it appears that with
a traditional upright cycling position, the seat height (as measured
from the pedal spindle to the top of the seat along a straight line
formed by the crank, seat tube, and seat post) that maximizes aerobic
cycling performance varies from 96% to 100% of trochanteric leg length
(Borysewicz, 1985; Hull and Gonzalez, 1990; Nordeen-Snyder, 1977;
Shennum &amp; deVries, 1976). On the other hand, Thomas (1967) reported
the optimal seat height for anaerobic high intensity work of short
duration in the upright cycling position to be 109% of the leg from the
floor to the symphysis pubis. Because joint angles were not reported in
the literature for these investigations, it is unknown as to what hip,
knee, and ankle angles will maximize cycling performance in upright
cycling positions, or how joint angles will change with different seat
height. It can be speculated that if the initial seat height was set at
100% of trochanteric leg length, a systematic decrease in seat height
would result in a systematic decrease in the minimum and maximum joint
angles of the hip and knee, whereas the joint angle range of motion of
the hip and knee would remain the same. On the other hand, if the seat
height was increased from 100% trochanteric leg length, it can be
speculated that accommodations would have to be made at the ankle, with
greater ankle extension during a pedal cycle.<br>



  <br>


For a recumbent position (i.e., a 75 degree seat-tube-angle and a
backrest perpendicular to the ground), Too (1993a, 1993b) did measure
joint angles when the effect of five seat-to-pedal distance (90, 95,
100, 105, and 110% of trochanteric leg length) on peak and mean power
production were examined. Too (1993b) reported that with a systematic
increase (5% increment) in seat-to-pedal distance from 90&ndash;110% of
trochanteric leg length: (1) the minimum and maximum hip angle during a
pedal cycle increased while the range did not change; (2) the minimum,
maximum, and range of knee angles increased; (3) the minimum ankle
angle increased, the maximum ankle angle increased until 105% of leg
length and then decreased, whereas the range of ankle angles remained
fairly similar from 90-100% of leg length and then increased with
increasing seat-to-pedal distance; (4) peak power increased from
90-100% leg length and then decreased with increasing leg length
(although no significant differences were found between the 100, 105,
and 110% leg length conditions); and (5) mean power increased (although
no significant differences were found between the 100, 105, and 110%
leg length) (see Figure 3<img style="width: 640px; height: 480px; float: right;" alt="" src="Figure3.jpg">).<br>



  <br>



This reveals that in a recumbent position, with a systematic increase
in seat-to-pedal distance from 90-110% of trochanteric leg length, the
minimum, maximum, and range of joint angles of the hip, knee, and ankle
do not change the same way to affect peak and mean power production.
Part of the reason for this may be the use of seat-to-pedal distance
increments as a percentage of leg length, as opposed to a fixed or
absolute value. For example, a 5% increase (based on leg length) in
seat-to-pedal distance for a tall individual (with long legs) will
result in a significantly greater absolute change in seat-to-pedal
distance when compared to a very short individual. In fact, some tall
individuals were unable to complete all 5 seat-to-pedal distance
conditions because they were unable to pedal in the 110% leg length
condition. They were already at full knee extension and no further
accommodation at the ankle could be made when seat-to-pedal distance
was further increased. In addition, some individuals appeared to make
adjustments in their seating positions during the test in order to
perform at the 110% leg length condition. This may have affected the
accuracy and validity of some of the joint angle measurements, and
would help explain why joint angles (and power production) changed the
way they did (Too, 1993a,b).<br>



  <br>



An alternative investigation to determine how changes in seat-to-pedal
distance would affect joint angles would be to manipulate seat-to-pedal
distance based on an absolute or fixed value (e.g., 35 mm increment for
each seat-to-pedal distance). However, the same concerns over
differences in leg length between very tall individuals and very short
individuals would have to be addressed. A 35 mm increment in
seat-to-pedal distance would be a greater percentage of the leg length
of a very short individual and would result in a greater change in
joint angles during a pedal cycle than when compared to a very tall
individual. Since it is not the actual/absolute seat-to-pedal distance
that is important (or the percentage of leg length that is important),
but rather the joint angles that result in the most effective
interaction between muscle length and force production, a better
alternative would be to manipulate seat-to-pedal distance based on a
systematic change in joint angles (but record the seat-to-pedal
distance as an absolute distance and as a percentage of leg length) to
determine the seat-to-pedal distance that would result in the most
effective joint angles to maximize power production and cycling
performance. Once the most effective hip, knee, and ankle angles to
maximize cycling performance are known, then individual adjustments to
seat-to-peal distance can be made to reproduce these joint angles.<br>



  <br>



Future research in this area of HPV could include an investigation to
determine whether the same trend in cycling performance (and in joint
angle changes) with increasing seat-to-pedal distance in a recumbent
position would be found if a maximal aerobic test was used instead of
an anaerobic power test. Based on force-length relationships, it may be
speculated that similar trends would be found for a maximal aerobic
test. However, when force-velocity relationships are considered, this
may not be the case due to a possible interaction between load and
pedaling rate. Because velocity (pedaling rate) is generally fixed
while force (load) continually increases in an aerobic cycling test,
and load is generally fixed while pedaling rate continually varies (and
decreases with fatigue) in a maximal anaerobic power test, this
suggests an interaction between load and pedaling rate (based on the
force-velocity curve).<br>



  <br>


Since joint angles have not been reported in studies where seat height
was manipulated in an upright position, additional areas of research
could include investigations as to how joint angles (hip, knee, and
ankle) and cycling performance (aerobically and anaerobically) change
with changes in seat height, and whether trends found are similar to
those in a recumbent position. In fact it would be interesting to
compare cycling performance, joint angles changes, and trends between
the upright and recumbent position with different seat-to-pedal
distances, both aerobically and anaerobically. This information would
provide a great deal of insight regarding how various muscle groups of
the hip, knee, and ankle interact with different joint angles, (as a
result of different seat-to-pedal distance and cycling position
combinations) to produce force. This would help explain why cycling
performance is different when different cycling positions (i.e.,
recumbent or upright) are combined with different seat-to-pedal
distances. <br>



  <b><br>



  <br>



Crank Arm Length, Joint Angles, and Cycling Performance</b><br>



  <br>



Changes in crank arm length, similar to changes in seat-to-pedal
distance, will affect both hip and knee angles. However, the effect on
the minimum, maximum, and joint angle range on the hip and knee will be
different. In an upright cycling position with a fixed crank arm length
(where the seat-to-pedal distance selected is already at the maximum
distance that can be pedaled in), seat height can then only be
manipulated to result in a decrease in seat-to-pedal distance. A
decrement in seat height (seat-to-pedal distance) will result in a
decrement in minimum and maximum hip and knee angles during a pedal
cycle, with the joint angle ranges remaining the same. Cycling
performance would be maximized with a joint angle range (minimum and
maximum hip and knee angles) where contraction of the muscles occur in
the most effective portion of the force-length curve (i.e., resting
length). This apparently varies somewhere between 96-100% of
trochanteric length for aerobic work (Borysewicz, 1985; Hull and
Gonzalez, 1990; Nordeen-Snyder, 1977; Shennum &amp; deVries, 1976) and
109% of the medial aspect of the inside leg from the floor to the
symphysis pubis for anaerobic work (Thomas, 1967).<br>



  <br>



On the other hand, if the same maximum seat-to-pedal distance is used,
but the crank arm length is free to vary, then the crank arm length
(unlike seat height) can be increased or decreased. However, any
changes in crank arm length must then be accompanied by a corresponding
but opposite change in seat height if the same seat-to-pedal distance
is to be maintained (i.e., if the crank arm length was to be increased,
then the seat height must be decreased by the same amount to maintain
the same seat-to-pedal distance). With changes in crank arm length, the
maximum hip and knee angle in a pedal cycle would also remain the same
(with the same seat-to-pedal distance). But, the minimum hip and knee
angle would decrease with an increment in crank arm length, while the
hip and knee range of motion would increase (Too &amp; Landwer, 2000)
(see Figure 4<img style="width: 720px; height: 960px; float: right;" alt="" src="Figure4.jpg">).
The reverse would be true if the crank arm length was to be decreased
(i.e., the minimum hip and knee angle would increase, whereas the hip
and knee range of motion would decrease). Based on the force-length
relationship, this would mean that differences in cycling performance
with different crank arm lengths (using the same seat-to-pedal
distance) would be attributed to muscle contraction of the hip and knee
occurring over greater or lesser portions of the force-length curve
during a pedal cycle (i.e., greater portion with longer crank arm
lengths, and smaller portion with shorter crank arm lengths). This
could explain why certain crank arm lengths are more effective than
other crank arm lengths in an upright and/or recumbent position.<br>



  <br>



However, if the hip angle was manipulated due to changes in seat-tube
angle (to result in a recumbent position), then performance differences
between an upright and recumbent position with different crank arm
lengths may be attributed to, not just muscle contractions of the hip
and knee occurring over greater (or lesser or equal) portion of the
force-length curve during a pedal cycle, but to different parts of it
as well. This would result in more (or less) effective force-length
interactions and provide explanations regarding why some cycling
positions (i.e., recumbent) are more effective and efficient than
others (i.e., upright). For example, with the same crank arm length,
muscle contraction in the recumbent position may occur over an equal
but different (and more effective) portion of the force-length curve to
produce force when compared to an upright position. On the other hand,
with a different crank arm length (i.e., shorter crank arm), muscle
contraction in the recumbent position may occur over an unequal (i.e.,
smaller) and different portion of the force-length curve that might
even be more effective in producing force when compared to an upright
position where a longer crank arm is used (as observed by an increase
in cycling performance). This appears to be supported by a comparison
of maximal cycling duration between a recumbent position (Too &amp;
Landwer, 1998) and an upright position (Too &amp; Landwer, 1999) when
different crank arm lengths are used in an aerobic test.<br>



  <br>


In a recumbent cycling position (i.e., a 75 degree seat-tube angle and
a backrest perpendicular to the ground, and seat-to-pedal distance
adjusted to 100% of the total leg length, as measured from the right
greater trochanter to the ground), an inverted U-curve was found to
best describe the trend in cycling duration for a maximal aerobic test
with incrementing crank arm length (i.e., 110, 145, 180, 230, 265 mm)
(Too &amp; Landwer, 1998). The longest cycling duration in the
recumbent position was found with the 145 mm crank arm length (mean
time = 737 seconds) and with joint angles for one pedal cycle as
follows: hip (minimum = 69 degrees, maximum = 102 degrees, range = 33
degrees); knee (minimum = 85 degrees, maximum = 142 degrees, range = 57
degrees); ankle (minimum = 89 degrees, maximum = 100 degrees, range =
11 degrees) (Too &amp; Landwer, 1998). When the cycling duration in the
recumbent position of this study (mean time = 737 seconds) is compared
to the cycling duration in an upright position with the same 145 mm
crank arm length (mean time = 541 seconds) (Too &amp; Landwer, 1999),
quite a contrast can be observed (with the cycling duration in the
upright position being only 73.4% of that in the recumbent position).
The joint angles in the upright position with the 145 mm crank arm
length were reported to be: hip (minimum = 103 degrees, maximum = 136
degrees, range = 33 degrees); knee (minimum = 80 degrees, maximum = 135
degrees, range = 55 degrees); ankle (minimum = 90 degrees, maximum =
110 degrees, range = 20 degrees) (Too &amp; Landwer, 1999). When the
joint angles between the recumbent and upright position are compared
over one pedal cycle, the minimum hip angle can be observed to be
distinctly different (60 degrees for the recumbent position; 103
degrees for the upright position), as well as the maximum hip angle
(102 degrees for the recumbent position; 136 degrees for the upright
position). Since the hip range of motion in the recumbent and upright
position was the same (33 degrees) while the minimum and maximum hip
angles were different, this would suggest that muscle contraction of
the hip in the recumbent and upright position occurred over an equal
but different portion of the force-length curve, with contraction in
the recumbent position occurring in an more effective part of that
curve.<br>



  <br>



With changes in crank arm length (110, 145, 180, 230, 265 mm) in the
upright position, the longest cycling duration (mean time = 565
seconds) was reported to occur with the 230 mm crank arm length and not
with the 145 mm crank arm length (mean time = 541 seconds) (Too &amp;
Landwer, 1999). This would suggest that in the upright cycling
position, increasing crank arm lengths from 110 mm to 230 mm not only
resulted in greater hip and knee angle ranges of motion (and smaller
minimum hip and knee angles), but also resulted in muscle contraction
over a greater (and probably more effective) portion of the
force-length curve. As the crank arm length increased from 230 mm to
265 mm, the continued decrease in minimum hip and knee angle result in
muscle contraction to be initiated from the force-length curve where
the muscles are in an elongated position, and therefore, not in an
effective length to produce force, resulting in a decreased cycling
duration.<br>



  <br>



Since the longest cycling duration in the upright position found with
the 230 mm crank arm length (mean time = 565 seconds) is greater than
the cycling duration with the 145 mm crank arm in the upright position
(mean time = 541 seconds) (Too &amp; Landwer, 1999), but less than the
longest cycling duration in the recumbent position with the 145 mm
crank arm length (mean time = 737 seconds) (Too &amp; Landwer, 1998),
this would suggest that: (1) in an upright position, muscle contraction
of the hip and knee occurred over a greater and more effective portion
of the force-length curve (during a pedal cycle) with the 230 mm crank
arm than when compared to the 145 mm crank arm length; and (2) in a
recumbent position with a 145 mm crank arm, muscle contraction of the
hip and knee occurred over a smaller and different, but more effective
portion of the force/tension-length curve during a pedal cycle, when
compared to the crank arm length (230 mm) that maximized cycling
duration in the upright position. This would also suggest that
increased cycling duration in the recumbent position with the 145 mm
crank arm length may be attributed to not just greater force production
in this portion of the force-length curve, but also to less fatigue.
(It should be noted that the joint angles obtained during a pedal cycle
with different combination of crank arm lengths and cycling positions
can result in an overlap where muscle contractions occur in the
force-length curve). <br>


  <br>

  <br>


Interaction of Crank Arm Length and Seat-to-Pedal Distance to Affect Joint Angles and Cycling Performance<br>








  </b><br>



The results and trends in cycling performance (as reflected by peak
power production) found with incrementing crank arm lengths in the
upright and recumbent position when anaerobic power tests were used,
were similar to those found with aerobic tests by Too and Landwer
(1998, 1999). An inverted U-curve determined from regression equations
was reported to best describe the trend in peak power with incrementing
crank arm length in an upright position (see Figure 5<img style="width: 480px; height: 360px; float: right;" alt="" src="Figure5.jpg">)
(Too &amp; Landwer, 2000) and in a recumbent position (see Figure 6)
(Too &amp; Williams, 2000). Similar to the aerobic study (where the
longest cycling duration in the recumbent position was found with the
145 mm crank arm length), the largest peak power was also produced
(1144 W) in a recumbent position with the 145 mm crank arm length when
an anaerobic test was used (Too &amp; Williams, 2000). Although joint
angles were not reported by Too and Williams (2000), a post-hoc
examination and comparison of the joint angles with the 145 mm crank
arm revealed it to be very similar to the joint angles found for the
same recumbent position and 145 mm crank arm length in the aerobic
study by Too and Landwer (1998). The mean joint angles (calculated from
the aerobic and anaerobic study) with the 145 mm crank arm length that
maximized cycling performance (peak power and cycling duration) in a
recumbent position during a pedal cycle are as follows: hip angles
(minimum = 66 degrees, maximum = 99 degrees, range = 33 degrees), knee
angles (minimum = 83 degrees, maximum = 138 degrees, range = 55
degrees), and ankle angles (minimum = 92.5 degrees, maximum = 103.5
degrees, range = 11degrees). This again, would suggest that muscle
contraction of the hip and knee for an anaerobic test occurred over a
more effective portion of the force/tension-length curve during a pedal
cycle with the 145 mm crank arm length than when compared to the other
crank arm lengths.<br>



  <br>



However, unlike the aerobic study (Too &amp; Landwer, 1999) where
cycling duration was maximized in the upright position with a 230 mm
crank arm length, the largest peak power in the upright position with
an anaerobic test was found with the 180 mm crank arm length (Too &amp;
Landwer, 2000). This dissimilarity may be due to the use of a greater
seat height (109% of leg length as measured from the ground to the
symphysis pubis) in the anaerobic power test when compared to the lower
seat height (100% of leg length as measured from the floor to the
greater trochanter) that was used in the aerobic test. (Note: in the
recumbent position the same seat-to-pedal distance was used for both
the aerobic and anaerobic study). This is supported by the larger
minimum hip and knee angles, and larger maximum joint angle and range
of motion of the hip, knee, and ankle in all crank arm length
conditions of the anaerobic study when compared to the aerobic study
(Too &amp; Landwer, 1999, 2000). This result and trend in joint angles
with an increase in seat height in the upright position is similar to
that found with incrementing seat-to-pedal distance with a fixed crank
arm length in a recumbent position (Too, 1993a, 1993b).<br>



  <br>



Different seat heights were selected and used for the aerobic (Too
&amp; Landwer, 1999) and anaerobic (Too &amp; Landwer, 2000) studies
because these were the seat-to-pedal distances reported in the
literature to maximize aerobic (Shennum &amp; deVries, 1976) and
anaerobic (Thomas, 1967) cycling performance in an upright position.
These two different seat heights (with different hip, knee, and ankle
angles), interacting with different crank arm lengths, resulted in the
180 and 230 mm crank arm lengths to maximize anaerobic and aerobic
cycling performance, respectively. Based on force-length relationships,
the important criteria to consider should be the joint angles of the
hip, knee, and ankle (minimum, maximum, range of motion) to maximize
force production with changing muscle length, and not the actual seat
height or crank arm length. Therefore, regardless of different seat
height and crank arm length combinations, the optimum joint angles to
maximize cycling performance aerobically and anaerobically in the
upright position should be fairly similar (such as the joint angles
observed for the aerobic and anaerobic tests in the recumbent
position). But this was not the case. The difference in seat height
between the aerobic and anaerobic test in the upright position resulted
in different joint angles over a pedal cycle when the same crank arm
length (i.e., 180 or 230 mm) was used and compared.<br>



  <br>



Based on the results of the aerobic study (Too &amp; Landwer, 1999) and
anaerobic study (Too &amp; Landwer, 2000) in the upright position, it
appears the most effective joint angles to maximize cycling performance
are found: (1) with a 180 mm crank arm length using a higher seat
height (i.e., 109% of leg length measured from the ground to the
symphysis pubis) for anaerobic performance; and (2) with a 230 mm crank
arm length using a lower seat height (100% of leg length measured from
the ground to the greater trochanter) for aerobic performance. A
comparison of the joint angles (minimum, maximum, range of motion) of
the hip, knee, and ankle between the 180 mm crank arm (with greater
seat height) and the 230 mm crank (with lower seat height) reveal the
joint angles to be dissimilar. Minimum joint angles were smaller with
the longer crank arm (230 mm) and lower seat height, whereas maximum
joint angles were larger with the shorter crank arm (180 mm) and
greater seat height. This is consistent with what would be expected
with a systematic increase in seat height or crank arm length. With any
given seat height, an increase in crank arm length (while maintaining
the same seat height) would result in smaller minimum and maximum hip
and knee angles, whereas with any given crank arm length, an increase
in seat height (assuming the maximum seat height that can be pedaled in
has not been reached) will result in larger minimum and maximum hip and
knee angles. In other words, a longer crank arm length (i.e., 230 mm)
would be expected to result in smaller minimum joint angles over a
pedal cycle, whereas a greater seat height would be expected to allow
the hip, knee, and ankle to extend further during a pedal cycle and
result in greater maximum joint angles. In addition, the range of
motion of the hip and knee using the 230 mm crank arm with a lower seat
height was greater than that of the 180 mm crank arm with a greater
seat height, and this is also consistent with the expectation for a
longer crank arm. On the other hand, the ankle range of motion was
greater using the 180 crank arm length with a greater seat height then
when compared to the ankle range of motion using the 230 mm crank arm
length with a lower seat height. This was unexpected, but logical since
a seat height greater than leg length would require greater extension
of the ankle while pedaling, resulting in a greater ankle range of
motion over a pedal cycle (than when compared to a lower seat height).<br>



  <br>



Since the joint angles (minimum, maximum, range of motion) between the
two upright cycling positions (aerobic test using a 230 mm crank arm
with a lower seat height, and an anaerobic test using a 180 mm crank
arm with a greater seat height) are dissimilar, this would suggest that
muscle contraction in the two upright positions occur over different
and unequal portions of the force-length curve. When compared to the
230 mm crank arm length, muscle contraction of the hip and knee for the
180 mm crank arm appear to occur over a smaller portion of the
force-length curve due to the smaller range of motion, while
contraction of the muscles of the ankle appear to occur over a greater
portion of the force-length curve due to a greater range of motion
(from greater ankle extension with a greater seat height). On the other
hand, the opposite would be true for the 230 mm crank arm length when
compared to the 180 mm crank arm length (i.e., muscle contraction of
the hip and knee for the 230 mm crank arm would occur over a larger
portion of the force-length curve due to the greater range of motion,
while contraction of the muscles of the ankle would occur over a
smaller portion of the force-length curve due to a smaller range of
motion as a result of less ankle extension from a lower seat height).
Since minimum and maximum joint angles of the 180 mm crank arm length
(anaerobic test with a greater seat height) and 230 mm crank arm length
(aerobic test with a lower seat height) in the upright position were
different, muscle contraction with the two different crank arm length
would occur over different parts of the force-length curve (with some
overlap).<br>



  <br>



The muscle length (represented by minimum and maximum joint angles) in
the recumbent position with the 145 mm crank arm length that maximized
cycling performance aerobically and anaerobically, can be used to
create a reference frame or model on the force-length curve (to
represent maximal cycling performance). Muscle lengths, based on joint
angles obtained from different combinations of crank arm lengths and
seat-to-pedal distance can then be compared to this model. If muscle
length (based on joint angles) with the180 mm crank arm (anaerobic test
with a greater seat height) was compared on this force-length curve
reference frame to the 230 mm crank arm (aerobic test with a lower seat
height), the following would be found: (1) muscle length of the hip for
the 230 mm crank arm would occur in a more effective portion of the
force-length curve when compared to the 180 mm crank arm; (2) muscle
length of the knee for the 180 mm crank arm would occur in a more
effective portion of the force-length curve when compared to the 230 mm
crank arm; and (3) greater extension of the ankle in the 180 mm crank
arm (due to the greater seat height) may result in a more effective
muscle length of the ankle extensors to affect cycling performance when
compared to the 230 mm crank arm (and/or when compared to the 145 mm
crank arm in the recumbent position). This may explain why and how two
different crank arm lengths with two different seat heights, resulting
in different joint angles and muscle lengths could both maximize
cycling performance in the upright position. The joint angle and muscle
length of the hip is more effective with the 230 mm crank arm length
(with a shorter seat height), whereas the joint angle and muscle length
of the knee is more effective with the 180 mm crank arm length (with a
greater seat height), and a greater seat height (regardless of crank
arm length) may allow a greater contribution of the ankle extensors to
force production.<br>


  <br>



The results of different crank arm lengths maximizing performance in
the upright position with different seat heights suggest an interaction
between crank arm length and seat height (i.e., seat-to-pedal distance
in the recumbent position) to affect joint angles and cycling
performance. To investigate these interactions would require a series
of studies where the seat-to-pedal distance is systematically
manipulated with different crank arm lengths. The effect on joint
angles and cycling performance, aerobically and anaerobically, in the
upright and recumbent position could then be compared. This would
provide additional information and insights regarding how seat-to-pedal
distance and crank arm length interact to affect joint angles, and how
to maximize cycling performance.

Crank Arm Length, Load/Resistance, Pedaling Rate, and Power Production</span><br>

  <br>



In a maximal aerobic test, pedaling cadence is generally controlled
(i.e., fixed) while the load is varied and continually increased until
the pedaling rate can no longer be maintained. At this point the test
is terminated. Cycling performance is then determined based on work
output (as a function of load and cadence) and/or cycling duration. On
the other hand, in a maximal anaerobic test such as the Wingate power
test, the load is fixed (i.e., selected based on body mass), and the
pedaling rate is free to vary, with the goal to pedal as many pedal
revolutions as possible in a given time interval (i.e., 30 seconds for
a Wingate power test). Peak power is then determined based on the
largest number of pedal revolutions in any 5 second interval (relative
peak power) or largest power output in any 5 second interval based on a
combination of load and pedal revolutions (absolute peak power). Mean
power is determined from the average number of pedal revolution during
the total test interval. Since pedaling rate is generally fixed while
load is varied (and continually increased) in an aerobic test, and if
load is fixed while pedaling rate is varied (i.e., decreasing with time
and fatigue as the test progresses) in an anaerobic test, this suggests
that some interaction exists between load (force) and pedaling rate
(velocity) to affect cycling performance. This interaction between
pedaling rate, load, and power output appear to be supported by
Seabury, Adams, and Ramey (1977).<br>



  <br>



The addition and use of different crank arm lengths would increase the
complexity of this interaction by affecting torque production and
pedaling rate. For example, a longer crank arm length in an aerobic
test with a fixed pedaling rate would result in a greater torque to be
applied to the pedals (allowing a greater load/resistance to be
overcome), whereas a shorter crank arm length in an anaerobic test with
a fixed load would allow a greater number of pedal revolution to be
completed (resulting in greater power production). This interaction
between load, pedaling rate, and crank arm length to affect
force/toque, power/work output, and cycling performance would require
an examination of not just the force-length relationship, but the
force-velocity- power relationship as well.<br>



  <br>



Since the goal of the Wingate anaerobic power test is to maximize peak
power and mean power over a 30 second interval (by pedaling as many
revolutions as possible with a fixed load based on body mass), a
shorter crank arm would be more advantageous to achieve a higher number
of pedal revolutions (and greater peak power). However, if the load was
increased, and continually increased for repeated tests, a resistance
will eventually be reached where (based on the force-velocity-power
curve) pedaling rate (velocity) would decrease. At this point, a longer
crank arm would be more effective in maximizing power production by
allowing the pedaling rate to be maintained with the greater load.
Similarly, in an aerobic cycling test where a low fixed pedaling
cadence (e.g., 50 rpm) is used (instead of a fixed load), a longer
crank arm would be more effective in maintaining the cadence as the
load increased (since a longer crank arm would allow a greater torque
to be applied to the pedals with the same force). Conversely, if a high
fixed pedaling rate (e.g., 100 rpm) is selected for an aerobic test, a
long crank arm would not be very effective in minimizing energy cost
when there is no load (or with a minimal load at the beginning of the
test). With minimal load and a high fixed pedaling rate, it would be
more advantageous to use a shorter crank arm length. However, as the
aerobic test progresses and the load continually increased, a
resistance will be reached where the cadence cannot be maintained with
a short crank arm (because insufficient torque is produced to move the
pedals). At this point, a longer crank arm would be required to pedal
at the required cadence, and work/power output would increase as the
load is further increased. In summary, in a maximal aerobic test where
the load is continually increased until the cadence can no longer be
maintained, low fixed pedaling rates would favor the use of longer
crank arms, whereas high fixed pedaling rates would favor the use of
shorter crank arms. On the other hand, in a maximal anaerobic power
test (i.e., Wingate power test), the use of very high fixed loads would
favor longer crank arms to maximize power production, and very low
fixed loads would favor shorter crank arms. This interaction between
load (force), pedaling rate (velocity), and crank arm length (joint
angles and muscle length) to maximize power production in an anaerobic
task, or to maximize work/power output in an aerobic task is consistent
with what has been reported in the literature regarding the interaction
between load, pedaling rate, and power output.<br>



  <br>



According to Seabury et al. (1977), with a standard crank arm length:
(1) there is a most efficient pedaling rate for each power output; (2)
the most efficient pedaling rate increases with power output; (3) the
increase in energy expenditure when pedaling slower than optimal is
greater at high power outputs than at low power outputs; and (4) the
increase in energy expenditure when pedaling faster than optimal is
greater at low power outputs than at high power outputs. Therefore,
with the inclusion of crank arm length as a variable, it can be
expected that: (1) an optimal pedaling rate and load exists to maximize
work output for different crank arm lengths in an aerobic test; and (2)
an optimal load exists to maximize power production (peak power and
mean power) for different crank arm lengths in an anaerobic test (such
as the Wingate power test).<br>


  <br>



An optimal load that can maximize power production for different crank
arm lengths in an anaerobic test is supported by Too, Williams,
Wakayama, and Landwer (2000). Power production in a recumbent cycling
position was examined with three crank arm lengths (110, 180, 250 mm)
and seven load conditions (75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165 gm/kg of
body mass) using a Wingate anaerobic power test. It was determined that
peak power production for the 110, 180, and 250 mm crank arm length
occurred with a load of 90, 105, and 120 gm/kg BM, respectively (Too et
al., 2000). In other words, with increasing loads, the optimal crank
arm length to maximize power production also increased, and is
consistent with what is expected based on force-velocity-power
relationships. If the crank arm length was not increased with
increasing loads, a resistance would be reached where the pedaling rate
would have to decrease. It should be noted that females were used in
the study by Too et al. (2000), and the optimal load for maximizing
peak power in the different crank arm length conditions might not be
the same for males, or for an upright cycling position (and topics for
additional research in this area).<br>



  <br>



The loads that maximized power production for different crank arm
lengths in a recumbent position when an anaerobic power test was used
may not necessarily be the same for an upright cycling position. The
greater power production found in a recumbent position (Too &amp;
Williams, 2000) when compared to an upright one (Too &amp; Landwer,
2000) would suggest a more effective force-length interaction in the
recumbent position. This more effective force-length interaction
(between muscle length and joint angle to produce force) in turn, would
suggest that the optimal load to maximize power production in the
recumbent position would not be the same, but would have to be greater
than that in an upright position for any given crank arm length. This
appears to be supported when the results of these two studies (Too

&amp; Landwer, 2000; Too &amp; Williams, 2000) are compared. Both
studies (one using an upright position, and the other using a recumbent
position) examined peak power production for 5 crank arm lengths (110,
145, 180, 230, 265 mm) when a load of 85 gm/kg of body mass was used.<br>



  <br>



In the upright position, Too and Landwer (2000) reported the largest
peak power (968 W) to occur with the 180 mm crank arm length, and with
a decreasing trend in peak power with increasing and decreasing crank
arm length (from the 180 mm crank arm length). This was supported by
regression equations to predict power production with changes in crank
arm length (Too &amp; Landwer, 2000) (see Figure 5). This would suggest
that if the load was increased, the largest peak power produced would
occur with a longer crank arm length, and if the load was decreased,
the largest peak power would be found with a shorter crank arm length.<br>



  <br>



On the other hand, in a recumbent position, based on regression
analysis of peak power production (from Wingate power tests using the
same load of 85 gm/kg of body mass as in the upright study) with 5
crank arm lengths, Too and Williams (2000) predicted that the largest
peak power would be found with the shortest crank arm length (110 mm),
and a descending trend in peak power with increasing crank arm length
(see Figure 6<img style="width: 480px; height: 360px; float: right;" alt="" src="Figure6.jpg">).
However, the results of the actual data collected revealed that peak
power was found with the 145 mm crank arm (1144 W) and not with the 110
mm crank arm (1139 W), with no significant differences between the two
crank arm lengths. (Note: this peak power of 1144 W in the recumbent
position with the 145 mm crank arm length is much greater than the
largest peak power of 968 W reported in the upright position with the
180 mm crank arm length). This would suggest that the maximal load (85
gm/kg of body mass) to maximize peak power had been found for the
shortest crank arm length (110 mm) and that any further increase in
load would result in a greater decrement in peak power for the 110 mm
crank arm length, but would result in an increase in peak power with
the longer crank arms (if the maximal pedaling rates could be
maintained).<br>



  <br>



Although there is no literature available regarding what is the most
effective pedaling rate to maximize work/power output in a recumbent
(or upright) position using an aerobic test with increasing load for
different crank arm lengths, it can be assumed that based on the
force-length-velocity-power curve, an optimal pedaling rate exists for
different crank arm lengths. However, whether the optimal pedaling
rates will be same for different crank arm lengths in the upright and
recumbent position is unknown, and would be just one of many topics and
directions for future research in this area.<br>







  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>








  <br>







Conclusions</span><br>



  <br>



Based on the force-length-velocity-power curve and the complex
interaction of muscle length, joint angles, and force/torque/power
production with load, pedaling rate, seat-to-pedal distance and crank
arm length, one obvious area for future research involving human
powered vehicles is to investigate these interactions. Currently, it is
unknown as to what is/are the optimal load(s) and pedaling rate(s) for
different crank arm lengths and seat-to-pedal distances to maximize
power output and performance in speed and/or endurance events. With
different crank arm lengths and seat-to-pedal distances, what is/are
the optimal load(s) and cadence(s) to maximize work and power output
while minimizing energy expenditure? What is the optimal crank arm
length, seat-to-pedal distance, pedaling rate, and load (based on
different leg lengths, and proportion of thigh to lower leg length) to
maximize cycling duration and performance? Is there one optimal crank
arm length, seat-to-pedal distance, load and pedaling rate to maximize
power output and performance (based on optimum hip, knee, and ankle
angles) for an anaerobic event (e.g., 200 meter sprint) and/or an
aerobic/distance event (e.g., 100 km, 1, 6, 12, 24 hour records)?
Answers to these questions become important if new speed, time and
distance records are to be set for HPV competitions. Of course, these
same questions can be asked and applied for investigations involving
more traditional upright cycling positions.<br>


  <br>



Based on the literature published, other potential topics related to
this area of HPV research include: (1) examining the interactions
between changes in trunk angle/orientation and seat tube angle on joint
angles and cycling performance; (2) generating regression equations to
determine the crank arm length, seat tube angle, seat-to-pedal distance
and joint angles that would maximize cycling performance, both
aerobically and anaerobically, in an upright and recumbent position;
and (3) comparing cycling performance (and determining whether any
interactions exists) between upright and recumbent positions with
changes in crank arm length, seat to pedal distance, load, and/or
pedaling cadence.<br>



  <br>



Novel areas of research could include how the leg length ratio between
the thigh and lower leg affect hip, knee and ankle angles over a pedal
cycle with different crank arm lengths and seat to pedal distances. The
ratio between the thigh and lower leg could be 50/50 or the thigh could
be longer or shorter than the lower leg. Individuals of the same height
(or different heights) could have: (1) the same leg length, (2)
different leg lengths, (3) same leg length but different leg length
ratios; (4) different leg lengths but the same leg length ratio; or (5)
different leg lengths and different leg length ratios. It would be
interesting to compare (or examine and compare groups of) individuals
of different heights, leg length and/or leg length proportions to
determine if similar joint angles and systematic changes in joint
angles over a pedal cycle (by manipulating seat to pedal distance,
crank arm length, seat tube angle, trunk angle, etc.) would result in
similar changes in cycling performance, aerobically and anaerobically
(whether in an upright or different recumbent positions). This could
involve examining systematic changes in seat to pedal distance and
crank arm length based on a percentage of leg length or on a fixed
value.<br>



  <br>



From a more theoretical perspective, studies involving electromyography
(EMG) and electrongoniometers (ELGONS) could be undertaken to determine
how muscle activity patterns and joint angles changes, respectively,
over a pedal cycle with changes in seat to pedal distance and crank arm
lengths in the upright and recumbent position. This information would
be needed to explain why certain joint angles, crank arm length, seat
to pedal distance, seating positions are more effective than others.
These EMG and ELGON studies could include observing: (1) when different
single and multi-joint muscles of the hip and knee are active and
inactive during a pedal cycle, and the duration of activity as a
percentage of the pedal cycle; (2) what are the hip, knee, and ankle
angles when different single and multi-joint muscles of the hip and
knee are active and inactive during a pedal cycle; and (3) when does
the minimum and maximum hip, knee, and ankle angles occur relative to
the crank arm position (e.g., top dead center) during a pedal cycle.
This information, in conjunction with the force-length-velocity-power
curve can be used to provide insight and a greater understanding
regarding how the body (i.e., internal biomechanical factors such as
joint angles of the hip, knee, and ankle) interact with the external
mechanical variables (i.e., seat-tube-angle, seat-to-pedal distance,
and crank arm length) of the vehicle to affect power production and
cycling performance.<br>



  <br>



This knowledge can then be applied to other types of HPV (e.g., arm
powered vehicles), as well as provide direction for the development and
application of more effective seating positions (whether it is using
human power to generate electricity or set new speed, distance, and
time records). Regardless of the topic and direction for future
research in the area of human powered vehicles, a lot still needs to be
done if the limits of human performance are to be achieved.<br>
