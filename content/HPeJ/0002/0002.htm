Powered Vehicles </font>(condensed version)

    <p align="center"><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </p>
    <p><i>Streamlined Human Powered Vehicles are often poorly
ventilated. This is most obvious from the heated faces of riders and the
steamed-up windows of the vehicles during long duration races and record
events. Rider overheating not only affects performance but can also
pose a serious health risk. These consequences are avoidable as a
well-designed ventilation system can provide adequate cooling without
requiring much power.</i><br>

<blockquote> <b>The necessity of cooling and ventilation</b><br>
  <br>
The human engine operates within a narrow temperature range. An
increase of the body temperature of only a few degrees leads to a strong
decrease of performance. In an investigation of professional cyclists
who could generate an average of a half horsepower (373 Watt) during a
one hour race, it was found that they were only able to sustain that
level for 5 to 15 minutes on a stationary bicycle ergometer operated
indoors. A world hour record attempt in a state-of-the-art streamlined
HPV requires similar power levels. Obviously adequate cooling is then
required.<br>
  <br>
The thermal efficiency of humans is less than 25%. An effective power
output of 373W therefore results in the production of at least 1119W of
excess heat which has to be removed by cooling, i.e. by air flowing past
the rider and by the evaporation of sweat. This leads to an increase of
temperature and humidity inside the fairing.<br>
  <br>
The following expression for the airflow S required for cooling is
derived in the <a href="ventilation2.pdf"> full article</a>.<br>
  <br>

 alt="[equation one]">&nbsp; [equation 1]<br>
  <br>
Here f is the efficiency, P is the rider's mechanical power, rho the
air density, cp the isobaric heat capacity = 1004 J/kgK, T the
temperature, L = 2.42 MJ/kg, e = 0.622, p the atmospheric pressure, rh
the relative humidity, and es the saturation vapor pressure, which can
be looked up in the spreadsheet file. The index i indicates the
conditions within the fairing, the index o the environmental conditions.<br>
  <br>
The effect of various conditions can be studied by programming the
equation for the cooling airflow in a spreadsheet. As an example the
airflow S for typical conditions To = 15&deg;C, Ti = 25&deg;C, rho =
60%, rhi = 80%, p = 101325 Pa, P = 373 W and f = 0.25 is calculated to
be S = 28 liter/s.<br>

  <p> The warm humid air in the fairing will have a tendency to condense
when it comes into contact with a cool window. With the preceding
airflow calculation the relative humidity at a window with T = To is
found to be<br>

 alt="[equation two]"> [equation 2]<br>
  <br>
Condensing water vapor will fog up the window unless this is prevented
by direct  ventilation of the window with unsaturated air.<br>
  <br>
The liquid that is removed by ventilation is produced by the athlete.
In the given example the rider loses 1.15 liter of fluid per hour. An
adult human can tolerate a fluid loss of about 1.5 liter. Larger losses
will quickly lead to a  performance loss.</p>
  <p> &nbsp; <br>
  <b> The power required for ventilation</b><br>
  <br>
The additional drag on the HPV results from the internal ventilation
flow and the accompanying losses.<br>
  <br>
The ventilation of a streamlined HPV requires power D x V which is
derived in the <a href="ventilation2.pdf"> full article</a> to be:<br>
  <br>
  <img border="0" src="EQ3.gif" width="310" height="72"> [equation 3]<br>
  <br>
where D is the drag, m the mass flow, V the velocity of the vehicle,
Aex and Ain the cross sections of the exhaust and input ducts,
respectively.<br>
  <br>
From this equation it follows that the amount of power required for
ventilation can be minimized by restricting the airflow to the minimum
required by cooling and by making the exit duct small and the input duct
large. This equation also indicates that the maximum power lost to
ventilation under the conditions used in the previous calculations and
at a vehicle velocity of 80 km/h is D x V = m x v2 = 14W. The power loss
is thus limited even in the worst case. If the input and exhaust ducts
are of the same size, the loss here would be 14W x 0.29. It should be
remarked that here only internal flow losses are taken into account.
See the last section of this article for considerations of the losses
due to the disturbance of the external flow.<br>
  <br>
The internal losses are predominantly dictated by the flow velocity
within the fairing. It is beneficial to keep this velocity as low as
possible. In practice there are two important limitations to the size of
the intake: the allowable disturbance of the external flow (see below)
and the minimum airflow velocity around the body of the rider that is
required to achieve efficient evapotranspiration and cooling. Assuming a
minimum internal velocity of 3 m/s, a cooling surface of 1.8 m2, and
the values form the previous calculations, we arrive at duct sizes
leading to a ventilation power loss of only D &times; V = 0.15 W. This
loss is minimal and there is no reason to deny the rider adequate
cooling and ventilation, provided that care is taken in the design of
the ventilation system, in particular to avoid unwanted disturbances of
the external flow.</p>
  <p> &nbsp;</p>
  <p> &nbsp;<b>Design considerations</b><br>
  <br>
In the previous sections it has been demonstrated that the power
required to provide adequate cooling is in all cases small, even with a
disadvantageous ratio of the intake and exhaust sizes. However the
external losses must also be minimized with careful  design of the ducts.</p>

  <p> <b>Placement of intake and exhaust</b> </p>
  <p>The best choice for the placement of the exhaust is at the back of
the vehicle, where the ventilation air is blown out backwards directly
into the vehicle wake. If the flow velocity in the wake is noticeably
lower than the free stream velocity the injection of ventilation air at
practically the free stream velocity may even lead to a drag reduction. </p>
  <p><br>
The intake velocity must be low. Because the external flow near the
stagnation point at the front of the fairing already has been retarded,
the immediate surrounding of the stagnation point is the obvious place
for the intake. There is then no need to slow down and thereby disturb
the flow at some other point on the fairing. As an alternative to a
stagnation point intake sometimes a so called &#8217;NACA submerged duct&#8217; is
used.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Figure 2 gives an example of a NACA duct on an HPV. Such an
intake sucks in the &#8217;dirty&#8217; boundary layer air.<br>
  <br>
Apart from the intake and exhaust, the fairing has to be airtight to
avoid unintended outflows and disturbances. Extra openings for the
ventilation of the window should be avoided. It is better to tap the
windscreen ventilation air from the stagnation point intake.</p>
  <p> &nbsp;</p>
  <p> <b>Size of the intake and exhaust</b></p>
  <p> The minimum size of the intake can be calculated from the required
volume and speed range of the airflow. The minimum speed of the airflow
was given above to be 3 m/s. Using values from the previous examples the
minimum cross-sectional area of the intake is 28cm2, corresponding to a
diameter of 6cm.<br>
  <br>
The optimal size of the (ideally variable) exhaust can be calculated
from the fixed size of the intake using the equations given above and is
found to be of the same order as the intake.</p>

Shape of the intake and exhaust</b>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>For the ducts to be effective, they must have the right shapes.
Sharp edges on the inflow side of the air channels will cause flow
separation and choke the channel. The inflow edges of the intake and
exhaust must therefore be sufficiently rounded. Sharp bends and
obstructions should be avoided. The air channels should be hydraulically
smooth to avoid the build-up of a thick boundary layer.</p>

  <p>A sketch of an intake conforming to these principles is given in
figure 3.</p>
  <p> Figure 4 suggests how a smooth constriction in the tail of the
fairing can be used to accelerate the internal ventilation flow to
almost the vehicle velocity before it is blown straight backwards into
the vehicle wake. In this sketch the exhaust is placed at the top of the
tail, because this shortens the route from the head and shoulders, where
the ventilation is aimed at, to the exhaust, thus limiting the internal
flow losses. </p>
  <p> <br>
  <b>Directed cooling and ventilation</b> </p>
  <p> The need for ventilation can be limited by using it as effectively
as possible. The airflow therefore should be directed at the head and
shoulders of the rider, as those are the prime areas of the body for
heat exchange. This can be achieved by connecting the intake with a tube
that ends near the rider&#8217;s face. Finally as has been demonstrated
before, part of the ventilation flow will have to be directed at the
window to avoid condensation. </p>
