  <h3>Introduction</h3>
Numerically Controlled Routing&nbsp; (NC)&nbsp; is a form of milling
intended for working large sheets of plastic, foam, timber or other
soft material.&nbsp;   The material being cut is held down onto the
mill's working platform by a vacuum while a rotating cutter, or mill,
cuts shapes   according to a pattern programmed into the machine. The
cutter moves in three dimensions, but generally only cuts shapes in one
horizontal plane at   a&nbsp; time.
  <p>As an engineer I've designed NC routed parts for storage boxes,
airplane engines,   telephones, military applications, and hydraulic
and medical equipment.<br>
  <br>
As with laser cutting, programs or drawings can be transferred to the
cutting machine via   a computer&nbsp; file (DXF format) generated
using a Computer Assisted Design   (CAD)&nbsp; program.&nbsp; Unlike
most other forms of plastics processing, there is no specific tooling  
required, so relatively small jobs can be done economically.<br>
  </p>
  <h3>Types of Cuts<br>
  </h3>
  <p> There are several types of cuts that make up an NC routed part:</p>
  <h4> Depth cuts and Hatching</h4>
  <p> The mill drills down to a certain depth, then proceeds to cut out
a shape.  The shape can be a single pass of the cutter or a hatched out
area. Hatched out areas will have a minimum corner radius equal to the
tool radius. It is simplest to make depth cuts in only one side of the
part: routing can be done on both sides, but the part has to be turned
over and secured in exactly the right position for this to occur.</p>
  <h4> Dowel pin holes</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;If a part is needed that's thicker than the raw material
you're cutting, the part can be built up in layers of material. A
common pattern of dowel pin holes placed in each successive layer of
material makes it easy to join the parts accurately once all layers
have been completed.</p>
  <h4> Through cuts&nbsp;</h4>
  <p> The mill skims along the top of the vacuum board, cutting a part
free from its parent material.  Through cuts are usually done last, so
the part only breaks free from the vacuum board at the last moment.</p>

  <h3>Bicycle parts produced with an NC router</h3>
  <p> Examples of bike parts I've designed using NC routing include bike
rack ends, recumbent seat supports and stoppers for tube   ends.&nbsp;</p>

  <p> Another application for NC could be making a male plug mould for a
streamliner from foam layers.   If you wanted to make a very accurate
plug mold for producing a fairing, the next step up would be to use a
surfboard shaping machine which is nothing   more than a fancy type of
NC router. Look up "John Gillis surfboard" [ref 1] on the net and you
will find links to a machine that makes surfboards automatically with
input from   CAD files, but imagine plug moulds instead of  
surfboards!&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Recently, I found an NC routed wooden lowracer bicycle frame on
the   internet [ref 2].&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
If a plastic bike part were to be produced in very large quantities
(1000's), an   injection-molding tool would make these sort of parts
cheaper and lighter than   NC.&nbsp;   But the cost for the tooling
would be huge.&nbsp; Until the day you need thousands of plastic bits
made to our designs, NC routing is the way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Firms who have NC routing machines include caravan, furniture,
cabinet and kitchen - makers.&nbsp;   These sort of small firms will
often give you a good price to custom produce a few, small NC routed
items.<br>
