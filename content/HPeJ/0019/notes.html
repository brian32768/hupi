      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span></h3>
      <p>HPeJ is pleased to publish this ground-breaking paper by Junghsen Lieh!
        While the basic assumptions are well known, his method of analysis and
        the resulting equations are probably unique. Most readers will not be
        able to follow the derivations and may find the resulting equations too
        cumbersome to use with a manual calculator, but the provided script(s)
        readily allow the detailed evaluation of the braking performance of most
        vehicles by changing input values&nbsp; and running on a PC. These notes
        show that the scope is not just road vehicles, but also guided rail
        vehicles and by some stretch of imagination, even human powered tree
        climbing apparatus!<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Scripts</h3>
      <p>The original script is <a target="_blank" href="closed_form_brake_bike_sample.m">closed_form_brake_bike_sample.m</a>.
        Unaltered, it will plot the four diagrams shown in <a target="_blank" href="02.png">figure
          2</a> of the paper using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>.
        Other similar programs can also run the script, but may not be able to
        plot the four graphs. The following modified scripts plot one diagram
        each and have been tested to work with the open source program <a target="_blank"
          class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a>.
        They sometimes also run on this <a target="_blank" class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
          href="http://hughesbennett.co.uk/Octave">online-version</a>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="closed_form_brake_bike_velocity.m">closed_form_brake_bike_velocity.m</a>
        plots velocity vs. time.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="closed_form_brake_bike_braking_distance.m">closed_form_brake_bike_braking_distance.m</a>
        plots distance vs. time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="closed_form_brake_bike_deceleration.m">closed_form_brake_bike_deceleration.m</a>
        plots deceleration vs. time.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="closed_form_brake_bike_braking_efficiency.m">closed_form_brake_bike_braking_efficiency.m</a>
        plots braking efficiency vs. time.</p>
      <p>The output diagrams show three distinct cases: front (axis) braking <span
          style="font-style: italic;">only</span>, rear (axis) braking <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>,
        and <span style="font-style: italic;">simultaneous</span> both axis
        braking. They do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> show the
        simultaneous front and rear brake performance during the full brake
        case.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>The paper concentrates on vehicles which do not slide or tip over. The
        first condition is simply defined by the invariant choice of the
        coefficient of friction μ, both front and rear. The second condition has
        to do with μ and the mass and geometry of the vehicle, in particular the
        height of the center of mass (or center of gravity) h, to some extent
        also the aerodynamic parameters and the road gradient. In particular, if
        Wr (equation 2a in the full paper) becomes zero, the tip-over condition
        is reached and a cyclist would either have to ease up on the brakes or
        be tipped over the front wheel. How can this condition be identified?</p>
      <p>Using the original data in the sample file, h is 0.4 m and the vehicle
        cannot tip. It is seen in <a target="_blank" href="02.png">figure 2</a>
        that if only one axis can be braked, the rear brake is the more
        effective one. Leaving all parameters as they are except h and changing
        this to 1 m, gives the following figure 5, which shows that the front
        brake alone is now more effective than the rear brake alone; the green
        (front brake) and red (rear brake) curves have roughly switched
        positions. The full brake (blue) curve is always the same, as this shows
        the maximum braking possible for a non-tipping road vehicle with the
        specified coefficient of friction. This implies that the distribution
        between front and rear braking is optimal.<br>

          of mass: h = 1.0 m</small></p>
      <p><small></small><br>
        <small></small>If h is increased further to 1.2 m, figure 6 below shows
        the front-brake-alone curve approaching the full-brake curve. This means
        the rear wheel is almost completely unweighted and the tip-over
        condition almost reached. Actually it probably is already reached at
        high speeds in this graph, as we didn't adjust the height ha of the
        aerodynamic center of effort.<br>
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><small>Figure 6: Vehicle nearing the
          tip-over condition with h = 1.2m<br>
          <br>
        </small></p>
      <p>(Do not be confused as I was, that the rear wheel curve is not much
        flatter, tending toward very long times : this is the rear brake <span
          style="font-style: italic;">only</span> curve and has nothing to do
        with the other cases. In fact, this curve shows that a vehicle will
        never tip over if only the rear brake is used, as the braking force is
        automatically diminished as the rear axis is unweighted. However this
        should not be used as an argument for not using front brakes.)</p>
      <p>What happens if we increase h even further? Obviously at some point a
        normal road vehicle will tip over with hard front braking. In the case
        of a rail vehicle with vertically guided rear wheel(s), the vehicle can
        however not tip over. This might be for example a car from a roller
        coaster. The rear restraint allows the deceleration force to load up the
        front wheel(s) more and achieve a higher braking force. Figure 7 below
        shows the result when h increased to 1.5 m: the time needed to brake the
        vehicle is more than halved using the front brake alone. The rear brake
        alone however has become a little less effective (for a non-tipping road
        vehicle). The curve for full braking is no longer applicable, neither
        for road nor rail.<br>
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><small>Figure 7: Tip-over condition
          exceeded with front-only braking with h = 1.5 m<br>
          <br>
        </small></p>
      <p>What happens if the height of the center of mass is increased even
        further? The following figure 8 shows the result of h = 1.74 m. The
        stopping time with front-only braking is approaching zero, as almost all
        deceleration force is turned into braking force. Therefore by adjusting
        the vehicle geometry, a vertically-guided rail vehicle can achieve any
        desired braking force, even with poor coefficients of friction and
        without resorting to brakes which clamp onto the rails. Provided of
        course that the structure (and passengers) can withstand the large
        forces!<br>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"> <small><img alt="figure 8"

        </small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="text-align: center;"><small>Figure 8: h= 1.74 m, indicating
            a very large front braking force and jamming above this value.</small><br>
          <small> </small></div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
        </div>
        <small> </small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">What happens if h is increased further?
        Using h = 1.75 m or more gives no more curves to plot, indicating a
        singularity. In practice it means the vehicle has jammed itself onto its
        rails. Clearly this is of no use dynamically, as huge inertial forces
        break the structure. However the principle is useful for quasi-static
        mechanical friction-lock devices e.g. for pulling ropes or climbing
        poles and trees. With a bit of lateral thinking, the script could be
        used to evaluate the required geometry of such a clamp, even if it could
        be considered a misuse of the elegant equations including inertial and
        aerodynamic forces, to solve a problem of statics!</p>
