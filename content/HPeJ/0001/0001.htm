  <b>Introduction</b><br>
  <br>

The following equations are intended for exploring how different Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) drag 
parameters in conjunction with a constant power input influence the velocity result.  These calculations 
depend on several assumptions: a constant rate of travel occurring in a forward linear direction,  a zero 
or positive (uphill) slope, and no wind present .

  <p> 
  <b>Discussion</b></p>

  <p>
The total power required to propel a land HPV at a constant velocity is easily calculated when the sum of 
losses and gains is also known [reference1].  Solving for velocity posses a slightly greater challenge.<br>

  </p>


  <p>
In the equation depicting power due to aerodynamic drag [equation 1], Cd is the aerodynamic drag 
coefficient, A is the vehicle's reference area, air density is the local current air density, and velocity 
represents the vehicle's ground speed when traveling through still air.<br>

[equation 1]&nbsp;<br>

  <br>

Because velocity is presented as a number to the third power finding its value, when unknown, requires 
manipulating a "depressed" cubic equation of the form:<br>

  <br>

[equation 2]<br>

  <br>

The cubic formula was "first published by Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) in his Algebra book Ars 
Magna" [reference 2].  By applying several ingenious substitutions and observations Cardano made it 
possible to solve for velocity by employing the better-known quadratic formula as an intermediate step.<br>

  <br>

  <br>

  <b>
Method</b><br>

  <br>

To determine  velocity begin by collecting values for the following inputs (S.I. unit): effective drag 
area, Cd&middot;A (m&sup2;); current local air density, air density (kg/m&sup3;); combined rider and vehicle mass, mass 
(kg); local acceleration of gravity, g (m/s&sup2;); coefficient of rolling resistance on the local surface, Crr (N/N); 
roadway slope, slope (radians); input power to drive train, power (watts); and drive train efficiency, 
efficiency (decimal).&nbsp;<br>

  <br>

Perform the following intermediate steps. Conclude by solving for velocity (m/s).<br>

Concluding Remarks</b><br>

  <br>

As presented, this handling allows input only of a non-negative slope value. Notice that the 
determination of the value of "M" is the adaptation of the quadratic formula to a cubic equation.<br>
