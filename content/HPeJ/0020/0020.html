  <h3><big>Introduction</big></h3>

  
  <p>Recent internet videos [2, 3] posted by Mr. Vi Vuong astonished
the human-powered-vehicle community. He had mounted cycle wheels "in
the place of pedals" on cranks on a working bottom bracket and used the
resulting assembly as the rear axles of a self-leaning delta trike. See fig. 1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Since seeing the videos I have built my own version of the trike, see fig. 2.
Riding it feels just like my equivalent bike [1] with the rear wheels
letting the vehicle lean in corners, cope with camber on roads and give
a suspension effect. The rear axle makes it feel like there's a
"virtual rear wheel" midway between the actual rear wheels.<small> [Editor's note: Steve has documented his progress with his trike then called Vicycle, starting <a href="http://modularbikes.blogspot.ch/2013/08/starting-some-new-bikes.html" target="_blank">here</a> and in further blog posts.]</small><br>
&nbsp;<br>
This rear-wheel mechanism makes braking or driving of the rear wheels
difficult, however it seems to be suitable as a variation on most
front-wheel-drive recumbent bikes. These include Python and
moving-bottom-bracket (Cruzbike) styles as well as fixed-bottom-bracket
direct styles (Bevo bike). There's no reason it should not work as well
on indirect-drive and other front-wheel-drive recumbents (e.g. Zox,
Raptobike, Handcycles).<br>

  <h3><big><b>Handling</b></big><br>
  </h3>
  <p>

The layout and steering arrangement of these new iLean tilting trikes
is shown in fig. 3 together with those of other leaning delta trikes and
non-leaning delta and tadpole trikes. <br>

In curves, the axes of all three wheels should meet at a single point.
This principle is called Ackermann steering [4], and unless this
condition is fulfilled, the tires scrub and resist forward motion. A
frequent demonstration of wheel scrub is in a tadpole trike with poorly
aligned (toed in or toed out) front wheels. Most delta trikes have
innate Ackermann steering, however iLean trikes do not. They have "good
enough" Ackermann which is dynamic and depends on the lean of the trike
as well as the trike's geometry. With good geometry, the trike's wheel
alignment improves when cornering at speed.  </p>

  <br>
<p>Handling and behaviour of
these trikes include:<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">On flat ground, straight ahead</span>,
the rider is constantly turning and balancing, just as in normal bike
operation.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">On cambered roads</span>,
additionally, seat and rider stay upright as the back wheels assume
different heights. Height differences between wheels are often small.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leaning during turns</span>,
the rider leans and the rear wheels assume significantly different
&#8220;heights&#8221; when seen from a plane parallel to the rear wheels. When seen
from the side, the horizontal distance between the back wheels is
foreshortened, reducing the wheel-scrub effect of the geometry.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suspension.</span> When one
rear wheel hits a bump, it raises the back of the trike in a lever
motion. The rear-wheel bottom-bracket assembly goes up only half the
height of the bump, and this is what the rider feels. On 20&#8221; (500mm OD)
wheels on a 10mm bump, the average rate of rise the rider feels is
close to that of a 2000mm wheel and the effective height of the bump is
still halved. This seems to indicate an effective suspension. (Refer to
complete article or suplemental spreadsheet for calculation.)<br>
      <small>[Editor's note: Part of the principle involved seems to be
that of the bogie, a modular subassembly attached to a vehicle,
carrying wheels and axles. Each two-wheel bogie halves the motion of a
single disturbance.]</small><br>
      <br>
    </li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simultaneous Actions.</span>
When riding, none of these behaviours occur in isolation. They all
happen simultaneously, but the mechanism seems to cope.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><big><b>Dimensions and Geometry</b></big><b></b><br>
  </h3>
  <p>
The relevant dimensions of iLean trikes are:<br>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lateral distance between the rear-wheel ground-contact points,
"Q" after the familiar pedal distance.</li>
    <li>Wheel diameter, "D"</li>
    <li>Crank length, "P"</li>
    <li>Longitudinal distance between the rear-wheel ground-contact
points, "B"<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notable, changeable influences on the geometry are:<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Q" can be made wide by splitting the crank axle and bottom
bracket of the simple "pedal" construction. The resulting wide space
can allow for a large load-carrying platform and improve the steering
characteristic by allowing "B" to reduce dramatically when the trike
leans in corners.</li>
    <li>"P" can be made short to improve wheel-scrub performance
without much compromise to suspension performance. This shortening was
done on the author's trike and wheel scrub (drift) disappeared when
170mm cranks were swapped for 90mm cranks.</li>
    <li>Suspension seems good enough that "increasing the effect of a
bump" by moving the rear axle close to the rider would not compromise
comfort.</li>
    <li>At least on paved roads, suspension seems good enough that
reducing the rear-wheel size from 20" to 16" would not compromise
comfort.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3><big><b>Static Stability</b></big><b></b><br>
  </h3>
  <p>
Preventing the rotation of the rear pedal mechanism around the bottom
bracket stops the leaning and gives the trike static stability. This
allows the rider to be stable when stopped at traffic lights or going
very slowly. The iLean trikes seen so far are not equipped with this
ability.<br>
  <br>
  </p>

  
  <h3><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scope</span></big><br>
  </h3>
  <p>
This study only considers trikes where the cranks making up the rear
axle are mounted on opposite sides. Other mounts are possible and these
can deliver different trike dynamics. One is with the cranks mounted at
90 degrees to each other as shown in S. Alexander Petraj's video. <br>
