  <h3><big>Abstract</big><br>
  </h3>
  <p>Recumbent bicycles can be more aerodynamic than standard safety
bicycles, and therefor travel faster for the same effort.&nbsp; They
also offer ergonomic alternatives by providing a large seat to support
the back, buttocks and shoulders while putting little stress on the
crotch, arms and hands. With careful design, chain
forces stressing the frame can be confined to small areas, permitting
lighter and alternative frame constructions.&nbsp; While forces caused
by rider weight dominate recumbent frame forces and chain forces are
smaller, chain forces can be the dominant force in particular
directions and flex the frame. When frames flex, energy is lost, so a
frame that does not flex can improve pedalling efficiency. <br>
  <br>
Recumbents confine
chain forces in different ways and this article explains and compares
the differences.&nbsp; The author's front wheel drive cycles and their
timber and aluminium frames are discussed.&nbsp; Although they use
untreated aluminium RHS or structural plywood monobeams as frames and
are homemade, they have endured for thousands of kilometres. Management
of chain forces contributes to their rideability and longevity.<br>
  <br>
This is a qualitative guide to chain induced forces in recumbent
cycles. Confining chain forces in recumbents to small frame regions can
result in lighter, simpler, less energy absorbing frames and extra
possibilities for frame joins and materials.&nbsp; <br>
