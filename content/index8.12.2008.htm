<div style="text-align: left;"><h2>Email from Richard Ballantine, chairman IHPVA</h2><h3>Date: 08.12.2008</h3><h3>To: IHPVA Board (International); Record Committee; HuPI/Human Power e-Journal</h3><br>As
some of you already know, a few days ago, Al Krause of the US HPVA took
control of the IHPVA.org domain name. I was on vacation and off line
when this happened. On learning of the take-over, I asked web master
Brian Wilson to get in touch with the IHPVA Board -<br><br>&gt; Late yesterday, Al Krause of the California version of the IHPVA took<br>&gt; control of the registration for the domain name "IHPVA.org"<br>&gt; I have not heard anything from Al in many months. I have not heard<br>&gt; anything yet from the previous registrant (Richard Ballantine) and I<br>&gt; don't know what the response will be from the international IHPVA<br>&gt; board.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don't want to be in the middle any more. I am therefore ceasing all<br>&gt; volunteer efforts on behalf of both groups, now. There is a mirror of<br>&gt; the existing site at WHPVA.org created when we tried to convince the<br>&gt; international board to change names but frankly I have no interest in<br>&gt; keeping things going just by changing the name. I want out. I have<br>&gt; other more interesting projects going. I am not sure what happens to<br>&gt; the existing content now.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Services that I provide currently on IHPVA.org including the mailing<br>&gt; lists for the international board and VPH (France HPV) will probably<br>&gt; stop working as soon as Al has traffic redirected to his site.<br>&gt; Hopefully this note reaches you in time so you know what is going on.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; One of the reasons that I moved the other (hpv,trikes,velomobile,etc)<br>&gt; mailing lists to bikelist.org was in anticipation of this day. They<br>&gt; will be unaffected.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The domain was listed as "locked" but the registrant "godaddy.com"<br>&gt; forked it over in less than an hour without any advance notice to the<br>&gt; registrar.<br>&gt; I recommend anyone who has a domain to protect that is using this<br>&gt; company's service to move it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hopefully Al will make good use of his new domain name.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Brian Wilson<br>&gt; ihpva.org webmaster 1996 (or so) - 2008<br>&gt; Corvallis Oregon<br><br><br>The question being asked by IHPVA Board members is: how was Al Krause able to do this? We thought the web site was protected.<br><br>The
web site was registered to me, and held in trust for the IHPVA. As
correspondence from the registrant firm Godaddy.com indicates, there
was a notice to Brian Wilson (administrator) that a change was
proposed, and an invitation to file any objection within 15 days. Brian
immediately filed an objection, but the response from Godaddy was that
the change had now been made and could not be reversed. Further
objection will have to be through arbitration. (copies below)<br><br>The
transfer of the ownership of the domain name IHPVA.org without adequate
consultation or any explanation may or may not have been 'legal' under
US laws. I have no knowledge in this area. To determine whether the
transfer was legal or illegal, it would be necessary to consult a
lawyer. To contest the change would also require the services of a
lawyer. The arbitration process is complex. Please see:
http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/<br><br>Other Board members with greater
experience or knowledge of the legal position re domain name ownership
may be able to offer further information on possible courses of action
open to the IHPVA Board. However, it seems to me that the Board has
clear choices.<br><br>We can choose to contest the take-over. I think
that will require the services of a lawyer, and that is likely to
require money. I know a good lawyer in Boston, who we used to check on
copyright for publication of the Human Power archive. To consult with
this person, I would need a mandate from the Board, and there would
need to be an operating fund.<br><br>We can choose to say good-bye to
the IHPVA.org domain, in which case a change of name would be sensible;
the World Human Powered Vehicle Association (WHPVA) proposed
previously, is one possibility. We already have the WHPVA.org domain
registered (and not with Godaddy!).<br><br>An important point to keep
in mind is that Brian Wilson has resigned from running the IHPVA web
site. Whether we seek to recover IHPVA.org, or open a new site with a
different name, someone will have to run and maintain the site. That
means having clear objectives. Do we promote technological innovation
and development for human powered vehicles by sanctioning competitions
and record attempts? Would we perhaps like to expand to promoting more
general use of human powered vehicles?<br><br>Setting straight-line
speed records is a specialised activity, limited to a few competitors.
There is only one site and one event -- Battle Mountain -- at which it
is possible to set a world record. This is of interest to the top
competitors, but not to the majority of HPV enthusiasts. Any effective
promotion of human powered vehicles has to move beyond Battle Mountain,
and beyond the limited activities of the HPVA. After all, Battle
Mountain is a premier site not because of technological innovation, but
simply because of geography; the 5-mile run-up provides some 200 Watts
of power assist from gravity.<br><br>It is said that when one door
closes, another opens. The take-over of IHPVA.org by Al Krause and the
HPVA could be an opportunity to initiate change and new approaches to
promoting human powered vehicles. There is a lot of positive energy and
vitality in the European HPV organisations, and indeed, right around
the world to Down Under (Australia). I would like to see us actively
promote human powered vehicles to new members in new countries.<br><br>Fight
the HPVA . . . or build anew. Either direction will require resources
and energy. I have copied this letter to the Record Committee, and also
to HuPI, publisher of the Human Power e-Journal, on behalf of the IHPVA.<br><br>Discuss!<br><br>[The best place for open discussion would be at the IPVA-mailing list <a href="http://whpva.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ihpva" target="_blank">http://whpva.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ihpva</a>]<br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Richard Ballantine<br><br>++++++++++<br><br>FILE OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN BRIAN WILSON AND GODADDY.COM<br><br>&gt; ---------- Forwarded message ----------<br>&gt; From:&nbsp; &lt;supportATgodaddy.com&gt;<br>&gt; Date: Thu, Dec 4, 2008 at 2:08 PM<br>&gt; Subject: Change of Registrant Initiated<br>&gt; To: brian AT wildsong.biz<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Dear Brian Wilson,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This message is to confirm that a change of registrant has been<br>&gt; initiated for the following domain name(s):<br>&gt;<br>&gt; IHPVA.ORG<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The email address for the new registrant of the domain is<br>&gt; a.krause AT sbcglobal.net.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>&gt; If for any reason this information is incorrect or you feel this<br>&gt; change of registrant request was made in error, you may cancel the<br>&gt; change request.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; To cancel this change of registrant request:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
