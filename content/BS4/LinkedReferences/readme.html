<p>The files in this folder contain links to those references from Bicycling Science 4rth Edition for which they are available at the time of publishing, 2nd May 2020. We have tried to find open access links if possible, or if not available, at least the Worldcat entries for libraries holding the item or the publisher's entry for purchasing it. References which are out of print, not in the library catalog, and not available anywhere else, are not listed here.

Whenever an organisation redesigns its website, besides ruining it, it usually loses most previously available documents. In those case we have listed the archive.org copy when available.

Links which have changed compared to the entry in the printed book, or have become newly available, are <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">highlighted yellow</span>.</p>
