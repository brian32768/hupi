<div style="text-align: left;">As announced in the news release in <a href="HuPIannounce.pdf" target="_blank">Human Power
55, page 5</a>, the Human Power Institute (HuPI), was formed in
January 2004 in order to promote the development and use of human power
for an environmentally sustainable and socially just
society. Primarily a virtual presence on the internet,
especially with <a href="HPeJ/index.htm">Human Power
eJournal</a>, HuPI also produced the <a href="http://www.whpva.org/HParchive/index.htm" target="_blank">Human
Power Archive CD</a>,&nbsp; a complete archive of past issues
of Human Power from 1977 to 2003. The archive was sponsored by Dave
Wilson and is fully indexed and searchable. Other intended projects
were described in the original <a href="HuPIbackground.pdf" target="_blank">background
information</a>. Founders of HuPI were Richard
Ballantine, Theo Schmidt, John Snyder, Elrey John Stephens, Brian
Wilson and David Gordon Wilson.<br>
