<h1>CROSS WIND, FORCE and VELOCITY VECTORS</h1>
<p>HPeJ REFERENCE (after Nigel Jones), AUG 02, 2004</p>

<p><img border="0" src="NEW-7.gif" style="float: left" hspace="10" width="355" height="452">Consider
a model train boxcar placed on a section of rail track. The wheeled vehicle may
move forward or backward in a straight line but not sideways or any other angle,
when rolled upon the track.</p>
<p>An air fan could be set to one side and slightly forward of the section of
track. When turned towards the boxcar the flow of air (wind) will provide a
force that will push against the boxcar. Because the vehicle's wheels are
constrained to a single pair of tracks,&nbsp; the direction that the boxcar
might move will not necessarily be the same direction or angle as the wind's
force originates from. Thus the direction of the fan's force can be understood
as being divided into two different directions; in line with the the track (f'
or force prime) and at a right angle to the track (f&quot; or force double
prime) . Only force prime (f') could cause motion in the direction of travel
which is determined by the tracks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How strong (magnitude) the fan's wind force is and how it is redistributed
may be<img border="0" src="NEW-5.gif" style="float: right" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="11" width="457" height="248">
understood&nbsp; by drawing a right angle triangle that depicts the original
force and it's resulting two components.</p>
<p>If the relative angle (radians or degrees) to the track and the magnitude (newtons)
of &quot;Force wind&quot; is known then the portion of that force directed
against the side of the tracks (f&quot;) and the portion of the wind's force
directed upon the vehicle in line with the tracks (f') may be solved for.&nbsp;
These are force vectors.&nbsp; In other words, a vector describes three relative
qualities &quot;magnitude&quot;, &quot;direction&quot;, and
&quot;angle&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-8.gif" hspace="10" style="float: left" width="400" height="176">Thus
far only the concepts of force and force vectors has been explored, we have not
yet accounted for the boxcar actually moving. Velocity is a vector as well,
which refers to a certain a speed&nbsp; (magnitude) occurring in a particular
direction.</p>
<p>Now turn to imagine a bicyclist traveling on a windless day.&nbsp; As he or
she pedals along through the otherwise still air an artificial wind blows past
the the cyclist that is of the same speed as the bicycle's speed over the road.
The direction of this artificial wind occurs is in the same direction as the
direction of travel.&nbsp; Thus the apparent wind velocity equals the
bicyclist's velocity (same speed, same angle, opposite direction, in other words
a headwind.)</p>
<p>Now add to the vision, if the natural wind were to blow towards the cyclist
from the same direction as the direction of vehicle travel. In this situation we
could simply add the bicycle's speed and the natural wind's speed together to
determine the bicyclist's air velocity. For example if the cyclist where
traveling towards the Southeast (135 degress azimuth) at 3 m/s and the natural wind where
blowing from the Southeast (135 degrees azimuth) at 2 m/s the flow of air
over the cyclist would be 5 m/s; as 3 m/s + 2 m/s = 5 m/s.&nbsp; The resulting
force vector due to air resistance acting in opposition to&nbsp; the cyclist's
forward motion would also occur at the same angle relative to the direction of
travel. Referring back to the above triangle depicting force vectors, f double
prime (the sideways force) would equal zero and f prime would have a value not
equal to zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the natural wind were to blow from any angle other than a &quot;pure&quot;
head or tailwind the force vector existing at a right angle to the direction of travel
will be greater or less than 0.00 newtons. Like the boxcar on rails, bicycle tires
roll freely in the line of travel and resist sideways motion. In extraordinary 
conditions such as slick ice and a strong cross wind, this force component could 
concievably contribute to the tires slipping sideways over the road surface.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-1.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10" style="float: left" width="291" height="500">The
diagram to the left depicts velocity vectors related to a bicycle traveling in
the presence of a cross wind.</p>
<p>&quot;V&quot; is the natural wind's speed. &quot;alpha&quot; is the angle
that the wind blows from relative to the direction of the bicycle's travel.
&quot;B&quot; is both the speed and the velocity of the bicycle. &quot;AW&quot;
is the apparent wind speed. &quot;beta&quot; is the apparent direction of the
wind when accounting for both the natural wind and the motion of the bicycle.
&quot;S&quot; is the side component of the natural wind's speed (much like
f&quot; above) which acts at a right angle to the direction of travel.
&quot;F&quot; is the portion of the natural wind's speed in conjunction with the
rate of travel&nbsp; over the road that acts in opposition to the forward motion
of the bicyclist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of these values only &quot;B&quot; (ground speed), &quot;V&quot; (wind speed)
and &quot;alpha&quot; (wind relative angle to the direction of travel) need to
be defined or measured by direct observation.</p>
<p>Two of the values might be better understood as being velocity components
rather than observable phenomena. That is &quot;F&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are
portions of the wind's velocity that act in specific directions.&nbsp;
&quot;F&quot; may be defined as being a the sum of the bicycle's velocity and
the component of the natural wind's velocity acting in opposition to forward
travel;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-9.gif" style="float: left" width="222" height="34"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And &quot;S&quot; is the component of the natural wind's velocity acting at a
right angle to the direction of the bicycle's&nbsp; travel. &quot;S&quot; may
simply be defined as follows.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-10.gif" style="float: left" width="152" height="30"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;AW&quot; (apparent wind speed) could be actually observed and measured
with instrumentation installed on the bicycle. It's value may be predicted with
the Pythagorean theorem describing the relationship of the sides of right
triangles.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-11.gif" width="187" height="38"></p>
<p>The cosine of &quot;beta&quot; (the apparent wind angle, or sometimes called
the angle of attack) may now be determined with:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-13.gif" width="172" height="29"></p>
<p>The reason for defining &quot;cosine beta&quot; rather than just
&quot;beta&quot; will be readily apparent in few more steps. A tuft of yarn or a
pendant attached to a bicycle will tend to assume angle &quot;beta&quot; in
response to the natural wind and the forward motion of the bicycle (that is if
other factors such as air flow patterns around the bicycle do not interfere.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-2.gif" hspace="10" style="float: left" width="269" height="492">The
previous wind velocity components as now defined can be brought together to help
predict how the presence of wind will effect aerodynamic drag, a force.</p>
<p>The right triangle diagram to the left depicts two forces. &quot;d&quot; is
the force associated with the apparent wind (AW). &quot;beta&quot; is the angle,
as previous defined as cosine beta of the apparent wind. And &quot;E&quot; is
the portion of the apparent wind's force that acts in opposition to forward travel
of the bicycle.</p>
<p>The equation to determine &quot;d&quot; may be familiar, as it is the force
due to aerodynamic drag: CdA is the coefficient of drag times reference area,
rho is air density, and AW is the apparent wind speed.. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-12.gif" width="250" height="34"></p>
<p>The portion of that force directed in opposition to the direction of travel
(E) is found in the following manner.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-14.gif" width="162" height="30"></p>
<p>The determination of force acting in opposition to the direction of travel,
as described above,&nbsp; may be simplified by using a single equation:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="NEW-4.gif" width="435" height="39"></p>
<p>When CdA is assumed to be a constant for all possible values of
&quot;beta&quot; and &quot;alpha&quot;, this mathematical handling is sometimes
known as the <b>cylinder model</b>, as a vertical cylindrical or spherical form
will exhibit constant air drag no mater how it is turned into an air flow.</p>
