Hi Angus,

For whatever reason, we never got your first message to the company
website.  In future you can email me direct at: bd427@bfn.org  (bike stuff
is my personal hobby).

I believe that the answer is that the data was measured and is presented
in bike axes, not wind axes.  The three load cells in my balance (I had to
build it for the tests) were mounted to the rotating portion of a
turntable that was installed in the wind tunnel and turned as the bike was
yawed.

Does this answer your question?  If not, I can go back to the original
report for Moulton (larger than the version published in IHPVA) and check
further.

** I have a separate question for you -- What is the point of HuPI when
there is already a perfectly good IHPVA and HPVA?  And, is HuPI using
copyrighted material from IHPVA without permission?  Certainly I was never
contacted about reuse/web-publishing of my original paper in the 2nd
Scientific Symposium volume.  Since I don't believe that any special
arrangements were made, there is a good chance that I hold USA Copyright
which is heavily in favor of original authors.

Haven't got time now to read over the HuPI website, but I will take a look
later.  Would appreciate your comments on this question of copyright.

Best wishes,

The first message was sent to bd427@freenet.buffalo.edu.  That was the 
problem.

No, my question is about the output of the two Fy sensors and how to 
combine them.  I want to say that Fy, the combined force perpendicular  to
the bike, is just Fyf + Fyr.

But that leads to an inconsistency which can be resolved mathematically 
by taking Fy = (Fyf+Fyr)/2  This of course doesn't make any physical 
sense, as far as I can see, unless the sensors were linked in some way 
that wasn't mentioned in the paper.
Please refer to this following link for the details.
http://members.shaw.ca/bicyclescience/CrossWind2/Milliken_analysis.html


As an aside:
The direction in which I wanted to take my paper was to show that the 
cylinder model of a bike in a crosswind was a rough approximation and if 
a term including the lateral cross section was incorporated a better 
model would result.  This is alluded to in Wilson 3rd ed page 149; "A
cosine approximation to the retarding force offered by the wind has  been
shown to be reasonable for an unfaired bicycle (see Milliken and  Milliken
1980)"
but that's it; the reader is left dangling.  After getting access to  your
Moulton paper I still see nothing explicit about cosines.  Perhaps  it's
in the unabridged version.

Getting back to my question about the total force in the y direction,  the
model I developed was looking very good using Fyf+Fyr, until this 
question popped up and spoiled things for me.

So that's all I want to know right now, is Fy equal to Fyf + Fyr?
If it is true then then I'll have another question for you tomorrow.

I'm not connected with either HuPI or HPVA.  There is some wrangling 
between the two bodies that I'm not privy to.  As far as I know there 
will be no copyright material on the HuPI site until the legalities are 
sorted out.  Unfortunately it will leave unaffiliated people like myself 
out in the cold in getting access to to the archives until matters are 
solved.  John Snyder has given me access to certain material, such as 
your own, but it isn't available to the public.

I have forwarded your email to John with the request that he deal with 
your questions directly.

Thanks for your time,

Angus Cameron

Hi Angus,

I got a nice letter back from Theo on HuPI and answered him, so you are
off the hook on that "hot" topic.  Of course you can still buy (as far as
I know) the Second Symposium volume from HPVA, so you have access to my
original paper (for nominal cost) whether you are a member or not.  The
money goes to duplication and other HPVA projects and the club is really
struggling right now--it would be nice if you supported the club that has
made all these things possible for the last 30+ years.
   Enough politics!

The two Fy load cells were pointing the same direction and were 62 inches
apart.  The front and rear forces should be added to give the total Fy on
the test bike.

One other thing is that the wind speed was a constant 20 mph (we corrected
in the data acq computer for slight variations from 20 mph) for all our
testing, so that when the bike and turntable was rotated, the x and y
components (in bike axes) of the wind speed varied.  Maybe this is causing
your problem?

I don't know anything about the comments in Bicycling Science 3rd Ed. Dave
Wilson was nice enough to get me a copy, but I've not had time to study
it.  Could that be one of the sections writen by Jim P?

Long after the test program, I calculated a hand written spreadsheet on an
HP programable hand calculator to look at the power required at constant
bike speed, with varying wind direction (constant wind from different
directions relative to the bike path).  The transforms involved some trig,
which I'm sure you can also work out for yourself (I might have notes
somewhere, but this was never published).

OK.  Just as it should be.

No that's not the problem either.  It was clearly stated in the paper 
that 20 mph was used.

Here are my assumptions:
- The yaw angles, forces and wind speeds were measured with high precision
- The Fx and Fy sensors were exactly perpendicular to one another and 
correctly oriented along their respective axes
- The resultant force can be calculated using (Fx^2+Fy^2)^0.5
- The direction of resultant force was in the direction of the wind, 
which, relative to the bike, is the yaw angle
- The x component of the calculated resultant must be equal to Fx at  each
angle

Can you see any errors so far?  Anything that I've missed?  If not then 
we are still faced with a pesky problem.

I'll give the link again:
http://members.shaw.ca/bicyclescience/CrossWind2/Milliken_analysis.html

Look at the the 2 graphs in the left column titled 'std bike sum' and 
'Moulton sum' (the 'sum' means the Fy values have been added together)

(Ignore the two graphs on the right; their Fy's were averaged not added.
  The nice correlation they show has been a real puzzle for me.)

Getting back to the link, why are the Fx's more or less equal at 0, 10 & 
20 deg, then diverge around 30 deg before reconverging at 90 deg? 
According to Pythagoras that shouldn't happen.

If I haven't made any error in logic (it's been known to happen) then  the
divergence must be due to to some anomaly in the data.  Gulp, there  I've
said it.

I like the general shape of the pink lines because they imply an
increase in effective cross sectional area as the yaw angle increases, 
just like a model I'm trying to verify.  The blue data points do show a 
slight rise at 10 and 20 deg, looking to me as if they were struggling  to
climb higher.

It's far fetched but there any chance that the something could have been
  interfering mechanically with the proper operation of the Fx sensor?
Or causing it to bind whenever there was a large lateral force?  I'm 
grasping at straws here as you can see.

It isn't always obvious to me who wrote what.  Jim's prose tends to be a 
little more formal than Dave's.

Why didn't you publish it?  This is just where I'm trying to go with  this
HuPI paper.  I haven't found much published on bicycles that I can  refer
to.  Your wind tunnel data is the only yaw information out there  as far
as I can see (by I, I really mean John S.  He is my research  librarian as
well as my editor).

Hi Angus,

You might like to assume that the bike and rider is a cylinder or some
other simple geometric shape--but it _isn't_.  I don't see any reason why
this should be true:


> - The direction of resultant force was in the direction of the wind, 

which, relative to the bike, is the yaw angle

With bluff bodies (some attached flow and large amounts of flow
separation) many nonlinear effects are present, including some small
amount of "lift" which will rotate the resultant force vector.  As an
experimentalist (not much of a theorist), I'm get annoyed when someone
takes the highly complex flow field around a bike and reduces it to an
extremely simple model.  That is the reason we continue to use wind
tunnels, starting with the Wright Brothers!  Some day, modeling (CFD)
might be up to the analysis task, but not yet (that I've seen).

Maybe you can use my data to disprove some of the various simplistic
analyses that have been presented in the past?

I'm confident that the data is good (within our max errors of a couple of
ounces, usually much less).  The three load cells were connected to the
platform with long wires and calibrated with dead weights (and pulleys) as
a complete system.  There wasn't much crosstalk between the load cells and
I believe that our calibration process took this into account, along with
tares for the platform with the wind on it.  The tunnel I used was run by
Dr George Skinner, a highly experenced aerodynamicist who was a friend
Paul MacCready when they both were at Cal Tech.

I never published the further analysis of x-force in various winds because
Moulton paid for it (he also paid for the data you are using) and he's the
one that would have to decide to publish.  I've done a lot of wind tunnel
work with bikes since then, but it's all done with customers that don't
want to publish.

Best wishes,
-- Doug

Hi Doug,

Thank you so much for your quick reply.  The fog is beginning to clear.
  More below . . .

So that's where I went wrong; the direction of the resultant force is  not
in the direction of the wind, not even for a standard bike.  Very 
unexpected to say the least.

Yes, that would seem to be the logical direction that my paper for HuPI 
should now be taking. My own 'simplistic analysis' will probably never see 
the light of day.  It was looking so good though . . . <grin>

[quote snipped -- jcs]

That's a shame isn't it.  There seems to be a lot of research, in every 
field, not just bikes, that could be released into the public domain 
without the sponsor losing any competitive edge.  The money has been 
spent, so why not get some added return in the form of good will and  free
advertising?  And that sentiment also applies to HPVA/HuPI.

It would give 'amateur scientists' like myself more data to play around 
with.  Who knows, perhaps one of us amateurs could even come up with 
something new.

Again thanks for the time you've spent in explaining things and for 
steering me in the right direction.

Cheers,

Angus

Hi Angus,

Before I did the wind tunnel work or built the streamlined Moultons, I
started my reading with:

Hoerner, Dr.Ing. S. F.  "Fluid-Dynamic Lift".  Hoerner Fluid Dynamics,
7528 Staunton Place, NW, Albuquerque, NM  87120. 1975.
  and
Hoerner, Dr.Ing. S. F.  "Fluid-Dynamic Drag".  Hoerner Fluid Dynamics,
7528 Staunton Place, NW, Albuquerque, NM  87120.  1965.

Both are classics and (as far as I know) long out of print, suggest you
hound your local librarian (interlibrary loan) or maybe hunt used books
online.


A summary of a lot of low speed aerodynamics for vehicles can be found in
this newer book:
