Hello,

First, my congratulations to all involved in putting the HP archives  online.  
I believe that making it accessible will lead to an avalanche  of new interest 
in the technology of human power.

However startup glitches are, unfortunately, unavoidable, and there is a  
serious glitch on pages 3 to 10 inclusive in hp55-2004.pdf.

I tried both acrobat reader v4 and acrobat v5. I haven't looked at the  
other files yet.  Hopefully they are all right.

Later,

Angus Cameron

Hi Angus,

Thank you for the kind comments. I too am hopeful that the information will 
ultimately open a renewed interest in HPV technology.

The PDF files are all subject to improvement. Thank you for pointing out the 
glitch!!! If you happen across any other errors please let me know as it will 
help make the archives more complete and useful.


Thank you,

John Snyder

John,

I've had more success today.

1.  Laptop with Acrobat 5.0 (full version) now opens it correctly for  
some reason, but only after a message box pops up with the warning,  
"This file nay contain newer information than this viewer can support  ...".  
Yesterday there was no such warning message.

2.  Desktop with Acrobat 4.0 still screws up.  So I downloaded Reader 
 6.0 and now it works ok, as it should.

I guess I should have checked for the update first.  But this is the  first file 
I've encountered that Acrobat 4 has failed to decode  properly.  I've remained 
with version 4 because it supports 'paper  capture' (ocr) whereas the newer 
versions don't.  Adobe is getting as  bad as micro$oft for building in 
obsolescence.

Sorry for ruining your weekend.  ;)

Angus

Hi Angus,

You helped made my weekend good! It is super that you are able now to 
open the files, and that you were able to upgrade to version 6. Myself, am 
content to live with Reader v5.1 until I upgrade my operating system.

When opening with Reader version 5 and below, many of the PDFs will 
return the same error message you saw, but should still be readable.

If you want to, also download issues 41 and 47 where your articles appear.

On the Index html page there is a link to a PDF Index that David Gordon Wilson 
wrote that can help identify other issues you might find interesting.

Best Wishes,

John Snyder

Hi John,

I see that there are copyright problems.  Does that mean you will have  to contact 
every individual author for his blessing before the archives  can be remounted?  If 
you need permission for my two efforts, you have it.

I like the way you wrote up the velocity problem in HPeJ article 1.  Clear and 
straightforward.  And thanks again for sharing the your  solution a year or so ago.

If you're looking for another short article I could come up with 
something fairly easily on the theoretical effect of a crosswind on a  cyclist's speed. 
I have it on paper and on a spreadsheet, but haven't  done the diagrams or html yet.  
It's a simple vector problem to resolve  the forces on a vertical cylinder, representing 
an upright cyclist, but  I was hoping to extend it to a horizontal cylinder, representing 
a  recumbent cyclist.  I vaguely recall seeing the vertical cylinder sol'n  somewhere 
else, perhaps one of the earlier editions of Bicycling Science, so it certainly isn't 
original.

On another note, Christian Starkjohann did very nice work in measuring  CdA and 
Cr using a data logger back in '96 or '97.  It had disappeared  from the web for 
several years until he recently sent me a copy together  with permission to publish 
it again.  See http://members.shaw.ca/bicyclescience/starkjohann/index.htm
Perhaps there is room for it at HPeJ as well.

Angus

Hi Angus,

Almost all of the HP authors save one have given permission as you 
have, though that not the sticky point.

The HPVA board  objected to the web and the CDROM versions of the 
archives being made open access.  Some of the board members believe 
it is an infrigment of the HPVA's assertion of ownership. The archives are 
now off line and distribution of 1,000 CDROMs has been halted until ruffled 
feathers can be smoothed down.

There has been some recent discussion about this matter on the HPV list.

I applogize to you for taking so long to write this reply. Dipolmatic wrangling 
has been eating almost all of my time lately that I'd rather spend painting with 
numbers, and working with the eJournal.

You are welcome and thank you for the compliment. But I had two very talented 
and tough editors to keep me on the straight and narrow. They made some 
outstanding suggetions that improved the clarity.

YES!


[quote snipped -- jcs]

Two or three years ago Theo and I worked out the trig using the cylinder model 
with cross winds for a power spreadsheet I was working on. I did some graphics 
diagrams and a test of the theory using a model railroad car and section of HO 
track set on a table and a fan. By attaching a lenght of fishing line with a mass 
on the other end to the model I could produce a constant vector force. Depending 
on the angle of the constant "wind" the box car would either move forward, backwards, 
or remain stationary. The kitchen table experiment provided some proof of concept 
and suggested ways of drawing a vector diagram, but could not validate any 
calculations.

Nigel Jones uses the vertical cylinder in his shareware program POWERCALC which 
provides a fairly reasonable, an okay explaination in the program help file. By being 
inside of a shareware program instead of an html page the information is obscure.

There is a paper I have in hand.  (hang on this ref is long) James C. Martin, Douglas L. 
Milliken, John E. Cobb, Kevin L. McFadden, and Andrew R. Coggan. 1998. Validation 
of a Mathematical Model for Road Cycling Power. JOURNAL OF APPLIED 
BIOMECHANICS. 14, 276-291. In this paper the authors describe wind velocity 
as being divided to a tangent and a normal component to account for wind direction 
and the bicycle's direction of travel. No diagrams. The reader is left to figure out the 
equations.

I haven't looked closely enough in BICYCLE SCIENCE 3rd Edition yet to see what 
Dave Wilson and Jim Papadopolous did with wind in the chapters on power or 
aerodynamics. Right at the moment I don't remember seeing any vector diagrams 
drawn out.

I suspect that Matt Weaver has worked on similar modeling. I don't know for sure.

Those things come to mind as related handlings, but I know that there are more.

And it also is my opinion that there is definately room to clarify the theory behind 
the cylinder model. I would very much like to see your paper.  The notion of using 
something other than the vertical orientation is very interesting.

If you have something available to send to me as a doc or text file would be a 
good place to start.

Oh lord, this one!!!  This offer is a dream come true. IOW there is ample room for it.  
I've looked at the work often and even referenced it in an HP article. Christian's 
original version is still accessible from http://www.archive.org though some of the 
archived graphics are no longer available.

The piece would be edited and reformated to the eJournal's style, my job, then
 approved by you, Christian if you are still in contact with him, and the senior 
editors. But the task is exceptionally doable, and very welcome.

What makes me excited about that article is that it has the strong potential of being 
a launching point for doing some more research/projects that could lead to a series.

To keep life easy, may I suggest taking these two generous offers one at a time. 
May we start with with your cross wind paper then work on from there? If you would 
like I will send on any of the reference materials that I have.

I'm sure Theo will chime in here very soon with more words of encouragement.

Thank you Angus!!

Cheers,

John Snyder

Yes broken, that's why I contacted him.  He was keen to keep it 
available and was happy to have access to some of my web space.

Good idea.  Also perhaps Hans Schreuder would be interested.  Have you

Not yet. A long term proposal was to also archive BIKE TECH and CYCLING 
SCIENCE on CD and web. Chet Kyle expressed some interest in doing that.

I'll ask around if someone might have a photocopy or scan of the Bike Tech 3 
article. Otherwise Rodale Press might be the only source.

Good! I like how you explain and show how to solve the problem. What 
program did you use to write the equations?

One aspect about the cyclinder model that can be expanded is why the 
different functions are used as they are.

Here are some attempts to draw diagrams (did it awhile back);
http://www.hupi.org/Testing/HPeJ/0002/vectors1.gif

jones.txt and vectors2.gif go together
http://www.hupi.org/Testing/HPeJ/0002/jones.txt
http://www.hupi.org/Testing/HPeJ/0002/vectors2.gif

I live in a windy part of the planet, Montana. Alberta gets the breeze too? There have 
been a couple of times when riding on gravel my bike has actually skidded sideways 
because of the wind's force. That first diagram only hints at how that could happen.

Some questions from an eager beaver in the back of the classroom.
How deep into the problem are you willing go? Would it help clarify the 
model by including some drawings or photographs?  Have you tried the 
experiment of riding in a cross wind with a tuff of yarn?  Are there any other 
hands on demonstrations you might include that might to bring home the 
concepts to an bright and interested reader?

I really liked your article in HP about how to measure efficiency using simple 
materials - alot. Could that same sort of tactile teaching be applied here?

Yes, I have and even assembled one just last March. But I was unable to get 
their program to read my wav files. Instead I used an open source audio editor 
program called Audacity to measure the pulses. I manually entered the time 
values into a spreadsheet to get a few seconds of speed data. Brian Wilson 
has expressed some interest in writing a newer program.

Here is a pdf of similar project.

Would be appreciated.  I'd like to avoid reinventing the wheel.

>What program did you use to write the equations?

A copy of MathCad 2000 from work that happened to remain on my home  
computer after I retired.  I like it 'cause it does algebra without  making 
errors, not like me.

I 'm using Dia for the graphics.

The southern bit is much like Montana.  Up here in the north the wind is  much more 
civilised.  But I know about the 'breeze'.  Once on a tour  through Glacier Park I 
spent over 2 gruelling hours in my granny to go  about 10 miles. 
How does gravel even stay on the road ?  Surely it should have all blown  
away by now.

>How deep into the problem are you willing go? 


It's not how far I'm willing to go, it's how far I'm able to go.

The vertical cylinder (VC) is nice to use because it's both symmetrical  and it's 
aerodynamic properties are known.  Also it's not a huge stretch  of the imagination 
to see that an upright cyclist looks somewhat like a  barrel, a short/compact one for 
the triathalon guy and tall/stately one  for the Amsterdam commuter.

As soon as you invent any other model to represent a prone or semi-prone  cyclist 
you are dealing with pure fantasy unless you can verify the  results with experiments.  
I can't think of any quantitative experiments  that can be done without access to a 
wind tunnel.  The university has  one but even professor John Buchanan, (juanco in 
the old hpv mailing  list),  couldn't get access, even after years of trying. 

So to answer the question:

   1. Delve into the spreadsheet and determine critical wind angles and
      generate colorful graphs for the VC

   2. Repeat [1] with a fanciful recumbent model and make comparisons to
      the VC

   3. No experiments beyond tufts of yarn.

>Would it help clarify the model by including some drawings or photographs?

Will be working on that

>Have you tried the experiment of riding in a cross wind with a tuff of yarn?  
> Are there any other hands on demonstrations you might include that might to 
> bring home the concepts to an bright and interested reader?

How about a series of coasting tests at a number of angles relative to  the 
wind.  All that's required is a perfectly steady wind and a large  perfectly flat 
paved parking lot well separated from trees and buildings. 

More practical might be small models in a home made wind tunnel.  Hmm  
that requires a bit more thought.  Might be doable.  Very tricky 
though.  Must go for a bike ride and ponder it.

Cheers,

Angus

Hi Angus,

Just a quick reply here. I want to mull over the other things you wrote.

>though.  Must go for a bike ride and ponder it.

Orville and Wilber!!!

Before they constructed their first wind tunnel they installed a
horizontal wheel above a bicycle's front wheel. It created a rotating balance. 
Two models of wing sections could then be placed on either side of the balance. 
By taking a swift ride around the block the lads were able to directly observe 
which model had the most drag (the one that "weighed" heavier in the wind).

Building a small scale wind tunnel might be a gas, too. <pun intended>

Cheers,

John

I had a similar thought when I traveled through there in the mid 80's. 
It's a beautiful place.

There is a paper* that contains some of the cross wind equations

Sounds good to me (the paper). HPeJ is getting close to publishing 
article number two by the end of this week. The schedule for the

your choice, we could try for a Aug 21 or a Sept 21 publication date

A pdf would be fine.  I 'm curious to see if I've found anything that  
hasn't been hashed out already.  The old "Nothing new under the sun"  
problem.

The August publication date is a better fit to my schedule as I'll be 
in  the UK for 3-4 weeks starting late Aug or early Sept .

Angus,

Here is a low resolution copy of the Martin paper.

http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0003/reference/MathModel.pdf (1.5 MB, 16 pages)

James C. Martin, Douglas L. Milliken, John E. Cobb, Kevin L. McFadden, and

Power. JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMECHANICS. 14, 276-291.

Please, let me know if you are able to access and read the file. The material 
provides the cross wind equations. More detail about the "hows and whys" of 
the cylinder model would be useful.

August 21st for publication will likely work out fine.

John,

If I defocus my eyes just right it's as easy to read as my wife's  
scribbling; ie no problem.

Neat that it confirms the cylinder model to a rough first 
approximation.  Too bad they used a lenticular rear wheel though.  
It  makes direct comparisons difficult.  For an ordinary bike I've been  
assuming that Cd is fairly constant while the area changes with yaw  
angle.  But he Cd of that wheel can and will change to a negative value  
at certain yaw angles.  See Table 1.  The drag area goes down with 
yaw  angle, not up.

So I could still be on the right track for standard bikes with spoked 
 wheels and no added areodynamic enhancements. 

BTW if you find any more references just give me its url rather than 
 emailing it.

Angus,

It's good that you are able to read the PDF. Trying to
make a long paper as small a file size as possible is
challenging for everyone, especially the reader.

You are definately on the right track.

Here are some more references.

1) If you can snag an interlibrary loan there is an
interesting book to look through.  It contains related
discussions and equations. (It's a good book, but costs
$45 new.)

Tamai, Goro. 1999. THE LEADING EDGE Aerodynamic Design
of Ultra-streamlined Vehicles. Robert Bentley, Inc.
Cambridge, MA. 291 pages (paperback)

The publisher's website is (was) http://www.rb.com  The
last article Tamai wrote for Human Power was an exerpt
from that work which indirectly pertains to HPVs.

2) Several years ago with others' help I laid out a
spreadsheet that incorporated some of the material 
from Tamai's book and the Martin paper regarding the 
cylinder model. You can download the Excel format file 
from here

http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0003/reference/Calc012802.xls

3) Nigel Jones offers a shareware program with an extensive
help file that will also be very useful.

http://www.machinehead-software.co.uk/bike/power/bicycle_power_calculator.html

His is the old school notion of shareware. A user is not forced to register 
in order to use the program for an indefinate period of time.

4) Keep plugging at it!! The cross wind consideration is an
interesting topic which needs to be clarified. As mentioned 
before I admire your writing skill and ability to clarify 
complex concepts. The article will fit well with the other 
articles that are forming HPeJ issue 1. Article 2 is scheduled 
to go online July 21.

John,

Another request.

Have you access to "Proceedings of the Second International 
Human-Powered-Vehicle Scientific Symposium"?

In Wilson's third edition there's a reference to Milliken and Milliken's  
paper titled "Moulton Bicycle aerodynamic program".  Dave writes 
(top of  page 149), "A cosine approximation to the retarding force 
offered by the  wind has been shown to be reasonable . . .", which
sounds exactly like  what we want.  It seems they may have already 
extended the cylinder  model to include the side area.  I'd like to see 
a scan of the relevant  page(s).

The Jones software uses the cylinder model, as you know, and it 
confirms  my numbers.  I haven't looked carefully at the spreadsheet yet.

Also I have to find a better way to measure frontal area.  I'm using  
ImageJ (an open source scientific image analysis program) but it 
requires a manually generated region of interest.  Frontal views are 
no  problem but side views are a nightmare because of all those nasty 
tubes  and spokes.  I'd like to find a technique (or program) that would  
automate the process.

Hi Angus,

Earlier today I just happened to looking at "Proceedings of the Second 
International Human-Powered-Vehicle Scientific Symposium". Here are the 
5 pages as gif images (plus a detail of the bottom of page 44)

http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0003/reference/41.htm

Measuring an image area can be accomplished with the histogram feature 
found in such programs as PHOTOSHOP ELEMENTS (confirmed to work) and 
possibly GIMP (open source.)  With such a photoeditor a photo can be 
converted into a black silhouette on a white background. Using the 
histogram the percentage of black (actually red, blue and green) can 
be determined. The area of the picture plane would represent 100%. Thus 
(area of picture plane) x (percentage of black) = (area of image. It's 
an estimate.

Here's a few places to obtain GIMP
http://gnuwin.epfl.ch/apps/en/index.html
http://www.gimp.org/windows/

Photoshop elements is sometimes bundled with hardware devices like 
Wacom digital pen tablets. It is also sold from the Adobe website 
and other retailers.

Painter is another graphics program that could do the task.


Cheers,

John

EUREKA!
Exactly the data I needed.  It shows that the cylinder model is a 
poor  fit even for the std DF. Make a small modification to include 
side area and BINGO!   R squared =  0.967

This paper brings it all together.  Thanks

Thanks for the clever trick but I later found ImageJ's ROI Manager  
buried deep in the menus. I still don't have automation but now I 
can work with several smaller  regions and then just add or subtract 
them as needed. Works like a charm.  And gives the 
area directly.

I resort to GIMP only for heavy duty editing when I need layers and  
masks, which isn't often.  Otherwise I use a variety of "lightweight" 
programs like Image Analyzer (my 
favorite) or ImageN.

I was surprised as well.  I expected to see a smaller deviation 
from the  cylinder model.

I'm enclosing one of the graphs.  The blue data points are from 
Milliken.  The red line is the cylinder model.

An additional term incorporating the lateral area gives a much 
better fit.

I'll try to get the draft of the paper together this weekend.

Except for ImageJ these are pretty obscure programs.  But each 
has some  impressive features.  But you are on your own when you 
try them.  Lots of trial and error.

ImageJ has more documentation available, but it is so 
speciallised and  customisable that it will never be 
completely documented.

In your graph what forces are being compared? The blue points appear 
to be the Fx vector, that is force exerted in oposition to the 
direction of travel.

Might this help explain the variable drag area values used in the

No, the blue points are the total force, found by SQRT(Fx^2+Fy^2).

The scale I chose overemphasized the magnitude of the deviation from 
the  cylinder model.  It's actually only ~12% at 30 deg. In most normal riding 
conditions the yaw angle is much less than 30 deg  so the model isn't really 
that bad.  Nobody's complaining at any rate.   I have to recheck my area 
calculations but I think the ratio of lateral  to frontal area must be around 
1.2 for a DF.

For a laid back recumbent the story is different.  The ratio is more  like two 
to one.  So bikes like my ShockProof  must deviate much more  from the 
cylinder model.  That has been my gut feeling at any rate.  So  at least I now 
have a good mathematical argument to support that contention.

>>An additional term incorporating the lateral area gives a much better fit.

Yes.  They had to find them experimentally since there is no way to find  
them theoretically when aerodynamic devices like disk wheels are 
generating positive forces at some angles.

My modified model visualises the standard bicycle as a blob with a  
constant Cd of about 1.0 but whose effective area increases smoothly  
from the initial value (frontal area) to a final value (lateral area) as  the 
yaw angle increases from 0 to 90 deg.

Tho' I suppose CFD methods could be used.  I wonder if anyone has  tried?  
There was a Russian CFD guru at my last job who did nothing but  find wind 
loads on structures.  It was a full time job using a dual  processor box to 
model relatively simple structures. I think a standard bicycle would be very 
time consuming to model accurately and then you'd still have to verify it in a 
wind tunnel  anyway.  Streamlined shapes are much simpler.  Hasn't Matt 
Weaver  already done it?

Hello Angus.

Aha, a dim light bulb just flickered on! Thank you for that 
illumination.

[quote snipped -- jcs]

A quick estimate of the Milliken data suggests some clues as 
to what that term "standard bike" might have represented in 1983.

Cd x A = (drag <at> 0 degrees yaw) /(rho x v^2 x 0.5)

Standard bike, crouched, unfaired ; (Cd x A) = est 0.43 m^2
Standard bike, erect, unfaired; (Cd x A) = est 0.49 m^2

To my eyes those guesses are high enough to believe that the 
tested DF may  have had fairly flat  or moustach bars such that the 
rider's torso was nearly vertical when in the erect position -- 
similar from the waist up to the riding position used on a BikeE.

Another article in the 2nd symposium proceedings, by Malewicki, 
lists the Cd x A of various DF and recumbent HPVs common at the 
time. One notable example (converted to SI)

(DF) Racing bike, fully crouched, unfaired; (Cd x A) = est 0.31 m^2. 
This is much lower then the preceeding estimates for the standard 
bike in the Molton sponsored paper.

In Human Power Spring 1997 (p 7- 9) is table of wind tunnel 
found CdA values for a variety of bicycles including a DFs wth 
CdAs ranging from  0.23 to 0.25 m^2.  The same study provided 
CdA = 0.39 m^2 for a mountain bike, which might be concidered 
the standard bicycle of 2004.  Dave Wilson's conclusion was 
(paraphrased) the tested unfaired recumbents have higher drag 
than the best diamond frame bicycles.

There is some tenuous evidence, based on a drag parameter 
determination via power project I've worked on and off over 
the past couple of years that the very best unfaired recumbents 
(ala' M5 style lowracers) and unfaired diamond-framed bicycles 
(triathelete bikes with aerobars) both achieve similar 
Cd x A values, below 0.2 m^2.

The suggestion here is that the rider's actual trunk angle 
rather than the bicycle's frame style has a larger bearing 
on the ratio of lateral to frontal area.

A possible implication is that the theorical drag form 
dimensions of the cylinder model might be updated as having 
1) height, 2) width, and now 3) an angle representing 
deviation from vertical.  My gut also feels that it might 
be reasonable to assume that at 0 degrees yaw(apparent wind) 
and at 0 degrees trunk angle results in the smallest effective 
frontal drag area. Varying wind yaw and trunk angle will alter 
the lateral and frontal area and potentially the drag.

It's a 3-D concept -- and more than a little exciting to
ponder. <smile> You may well be exploring something new and
very important here Angus!


[quote snipped -- jcs]

Even with the disk wheels might there still be some way of 
reconciling the measurements to the modified model?

Could trunk angle be called "pitch"?  As bicyclists we hope 
there is very little "roll" involved <humor> though it might 
have an influnce when cornering in the presence of wind. 
Cornering might be difficult to deal with as a simple math model.

Yes I believe Matt has done just that.  http://www.speed101.com/
His email address according to that page is:

That triggers a memory about another reference about cross wind 
stability by Dr Fuchs that I haven't looked at in a long time. 
Maybe there is something useful here. (The doc and html are 
supposed to be the same, but there might be some broken graphic 
links in the html.)

Hello John,

Just an update.  The latest revision is at
http://members.shaw.ca/bicyclescience/CrossWind2/SideWind2.html 
but I  have discovered a major problem reconciling my model with Milliken's  
data.   So we are due for another revision.

I have emailed Doug Milliken for some clarification of the definition of  Fx, 
Fyr and Fyr.  It is either clearly different from how I interpreted  the paper 
or else his numbers are wrong (which I doubt).

Depending on how Doug answers, one of the following will be true:

a)  The cylinder model is correct and my model is headed for the bin. 
b)  My assumptions were right, which means there could be problems with  his data.
c)  There is another answer that I haven't thought of.

Have a good weekend,

Angus

John,

Just to clarify.  I had been working mainly with F_total, the 
SQRT(Fx^2+Fy^2) and getting excellent agreement with my 
lateral area  model.  There was also a real nice fit with frontal 
areas of my own  touring bike, measured with ImageJ.  So I started 
writing up the current  revision, happy that all the pieces fit together 
so nicely.  Life was good.

Then I checked the agreement between the Fx and the x component 
of the  model.  The spot where I was working on at the time is marked 
by the  sentence in the red font.  Abysmal agreement.

I can optimise one of; x components, y components or the total, but not  
all simultaneously.  Sigh.  If I optimise for the x components then the  
cylinder model falls out automatically.  Otherwise the lateral area  model 
falls out.  It all depends on Milliken's Fyf and Fyr.  I sure hope  he can 
recall the details and/or find his notes.

Angus

Hi Angus,

Your paper is going in a good direction. It causes the neurons to fire! 
This is a reply to both of your emails from last Friday, and I hope I'm on 
track with what you wrote in them.

A rough comparison might be drawn in relation to the cylinder modeling 
of an unfaired bicyclist to a rectangular sheet of thin plywood. Perhaps 
the average unfaired cyclist is more like a flat plane than a cylinder, 
or a little of both (a hyperbolic way of viewing lateral area).

If placed on edge with its smallest dimension facing into a stream of 
air the plywood sheet would potentially exhibit it's minimal aerodynamic 
drag (least amount of frontal area). And, if turned on a vertical axis 
the resulting aero drag would possibly reach a maximum quantity when 
that form's greatest frontal area presented its self at a right angle 
to the flow of air. Described this way the effective frontal Area would 
increase as would the Force due to aerodynamic drag. This description 
however does not account for the Coefficient of drag, which may or may 
not be changing as the apparent frontal area changes. This makes for 
a hard to pin down situation as Area is a variable, Cd is potentially 
a variable or a constant, and their product is not a single value 
either, though measurable. XY=Z+n.

In an analysis of the effects of wind yaw on a single form it is 
possible to treat Area as a constant. Frontal area is but one possible 
reference to use in CdA. It is possible to use other defined areas as 
the reference such as planar area (viewed from above), wetted surface 
area, or even a volumetric based estimate of the surface area. For a 
much better description of the options available I hope you will enjoy 
reading through these 15 pages taken from Goro Tamai's THE LEADING EDGE
http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0003/reference/01.htm

(This time around I was trying to make these scans as easy to read as 
possible. Depending on your internet connection speed the web pages 
may load slowly. The book pages as graphic files are between 130 to 
200 KB each. Please forgive the occasional twist in the scans. I was 
doing some serious-silly juggling trying to hold the book on the 
scanner with one out-stretched hand, while the other hand was 
clicking the mouse on another desk.)

Picking a constant reference area will allow some math manipulation 
not possible otherwise that may help sort things through. <knock 
on wood> For example going back to the piece of plywood example, its
surface area (approx. width x height x 2) as a reference would not 
change when the wind's yaw angle varied. Only it's Cd would change 
within the knowable quantity (Cd x A). Thus patterns like the
following might be tried;

Area <at> yaw angle = F drag/(Cd * rho * v^2 * 0.5) = a constant quantity, thus

[eq]  F1 /Cd1 = F2/Cd2

where 1 & 2 reflect values measured at different yaw angles 
(not that this eq means anything in particular, just that such 
manipulation is possible.)

IOW, if the reference area is treated as a constant at all yaw 
angles (even if not quantified, though it could be), and if Force 
is known via measurement at given yaw angles then Cd at a specific 
yaw angle can be solved for when the corresponding CdA is known, 
and trends in how Cd might change be looked at. This is just 
another "trick" as Tamai might call it, and in the same logic 
pattern as holding drag coefficient to 1.0. Again, the latest 
reference will explain these concepts with more clarity.

I had not realized that the cylinder model needed to looked 
at more closely, or that it was prone to as much error as it 
seems you have uncovered.

[quote snipped -- jcs]

Results in agreement and in disagreement with any hypothesis 
are equally valid, and equally important. Life still is better 
than good!! <Why should sport events be the only place for a

[quote snipped -- jcs]

If I read the diagram of the wind tunnel correctly there were 
three force measurements made in two axes, Y quantified front 
and rear. As you have writen (Fyf+Fyr = Fy). I doubt that Milliken 
meant anything different, but it is good to double check if possible.

And as you pointed earlier the cylinder model should create a 
constant F total value that was not yaw angle dependant. Pointing 
out that the cylinder model does not predict an objective observation 
is in itself, very important. This inconsistency is likely a part of 
the reason that the Martin et. al. paper limited it's modeling and 
measurements to relatively shallow angles of yaw.


[quote snipped -- jcs]

Thank you for the updates! The HTML drafts with tables and

I agree with you, the data is likely good.


[quote snipped -- jcs]

I suspect now that the cylinder model is highly limited, if 
not outright wrong except in a few situations such as generalizing 
the effects of cross winds for a cyclist riding an upright Phillip's 
style roadster or for very shallow yaw angles.


[quote snipped -- jcs]

Also, I suspect that your hypothesis is growing in the right 
direction, by getting exceptionally close to either creating a 
much better model that works in more cases or highlighting the 
limitations of the current model. Either way represents an 
important step forward.


>c) There is another answer that I haven't thought of.

This is where the fun comes in. The search and the creativity!!!

This is exceptionally good work that you are doing, Angus. I am 
enjoying watching and learning how you work at problem solving.  
I know from experience the effort involved and appriciate it. 
Thank you.


Best Wishes,

John
