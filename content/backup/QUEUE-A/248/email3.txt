Hi Angus,

You are welcome for the links. And, here is a link to many of the links
we've shared in this project as well as a text file of the emails that you
and I have exchanged.

http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0003/reference/index_of_0003.htm

Hopefully this page will help Theo and or Dave, get up to speed on the
work you have been doing, as well as help keep track of the online
materials.

What I am puzzelled by at the moment is how the Fx axis does fit (and that
is an important finding) while the Fy axis data does not fit. May be two
pairs of fresh eyes can help sort this through?

I compared the vector model with your law of cosines handling. Both
created the same Fx curve(as should be expected).

The days are hot, but this is one cool problem! <grin>

Cheers,

John

PS
I may start using my other email address HPJournal@att.net on occassion
for this correspondence.

John,

I love to work with people who can keep me organised and on track.  The 
new TOC page is great.


>> What I am puzzelled by at the moment is how the Fx axis does fit (and

I wish Doug would jump into this.  My (our) assumption that the total 
force in the y direction is the sum of Fyf and Fyr, is the problem.

Here is my test for consistency:
the resultant force at any angle theta is Ftot = SQRT(Fx^2+Fy^2) where  Fx
and Fy are the measurements.
Then Ftot * cos(theta) should result in a value close to the original Fx.

This is what happens (numbers in lb):
yaw	Fx	Ftot*cos(theta)
0	4.70	4.78
10	4.93	4.91
20	4.72	4.89
30	4.57	5.48
60	2.92	4.76
90	0.59	0.00
Notice that the numbers go really wonky at 30 and 60 deg.

y values
yaw	Fy	Ftot*sin(theta)
0	-0.85	0.00
10	0.71	0.86
20	2.19	1.78
30	4.37	3.16
60	9.06	8.24
90	10.79	10.81
The y components look not too bad

Now let's go through the same exercise except that Fy is the average, 
instead of the sum, of Fyf and Fyr:

yaw	Fx	Ftot*cos(theta)
0	4.70	4.72
10	4.93	4.87
20	4.72	4.55
30	4.57	4.39
60	2.92	2.69
90	0.59	0.00

yaw	Fy	Ftot*sin(theta)
0	0.00	0.00
10	0.43	0.86
20	0.89	1.66
30	1.58	2.53
60	4.12	4.67
90	5.40	5.43

The differences are striking when you plot them.  These two tables  scream
out "we're right" without giving any clue why they should be.  That's why
I wrote to Doug for clarification on the meaning of Fyf and  Fyr.  I think
that this test is valid.  Agreed?

Note that I have a sort of vested interest in the original definition 
because it gives such a nice correlation between the areas I measured 
directly and those calculated from Doug's data.
But averaging them always results in better consistency; except then my 
nice area correlations evaporate.  Sigh

Two pairs of fresh eyes (or even more) would be most welcome.


Cheers,
Angus

Angus,

I concur with your notion of an average. It fits well.

A second piece of information suggesting that [(Fyf+Fyr)/2] = (Fy average)
is contained within the raw data.  Where possible, compare the zero-degree
yaw forces (unfaired bicycles) to their coresponding 90-degree yaw force
measures.

"Standard bike, erect, unfaired" is as close to a vertical cylinder as
occurs in the testing. Its Fx measurement was 5.33 lbf.  The same quantity
of force would most likely occur if that cylinderical form were in a
horizontal orientation.  It would have the same frontal area and
coefficient of drag, as the change would merely swap around the height and
width dimensions. A quick visualization to clarify; tip the letter "I"
onto its side "_".  The two orientations of that single character have the
same frontal area. Thus we might expect the Fy total values at 90-degrees
yaw of the unfaired bicycles to be in the neighborhood of 5.33 lbf in a 20
mph wind stream. And, that is what happens if we look at only the values
of Fyf or only at the values Fxr.  Adding Fyf to Fyr together makes the
result of Fy total approximately twice of what we might intuitively
believe to be reasonable a drag value. Averaging the two together produces
an intuitively reasonable value for the measurements.

The next question is why do the two measurements represent an average and
not a sum? What are the physical principles governing the force pickups
and balance?

From page 41, "As part of this project, a sensitive balance was built for
use in this wind tunnel. This enabled the measurement of three forces, one
along the axis and two normal to the the axis of the bike with an accuracy
of a few ounces."  I assume that the word "normal" used here means at a
right angle. Perhaps the sketch at the bottom of page 44 (the html has a
detail), may contain some vital clues as to how to interpet the Fyf and
Fyr values. There appears to have been a vertical fulcrum or point of
rotation, at the mid-point of the tested bicycles. Notice too, that when
in the unbalanced condition (10 through 60 degrees yaw) that Fyf andFyx
are both reported as positive values.

Even if Doug doesn't jump in, I can smell the "aha" getting close, but
don't see it yet. The solutions to such puzzels often reveal themselves in
the least expected moments of the day. <grin>

Cheers,

John

Hi Angus,

Thank you! Thank you, for forwarding Doug's questions about HuPI to me. I
in turn handed the questions over to Dave Wilson who has just returned
from a month long cycling trip in the UK. Dave and Doug are well
acquainted with one another, long time friends.

Your new web page is an excellent clarification.

http://members.shaw.ca/bicyclescience/CrossWind2/Milliken_analysis.html

>This is where my own cross section measurements come in.  For the case
[quote snipped -- jcs]

These area measurements are compelling to me because of the differences
seem to double as did the force measures of the Fy axis when summed.

The side and front aspect of the cyclist will vary as you have measured by
apparent area (apparent, meaning that which can be seen from a single
point of view.) These two aspects will also present different cross
section shapes relative to the air flow, thus likely generating different
Cd values as well.

Bicycle Science III, pages 189-190 contains a discussion that might fit
here. In Figure 5.10 the authors present a variety of two and
three-dimensional shapes with associated Cd values.  In accordance with
that figure a hollow half-sphere (as one example) with its open-side
pointed away from the airflow has Cd 0.38. The same hollow half-sphere
when rotated such that the open is pointed towards the flow has a Cd 1.42.
The reference area (frontal, planar or surface) remained a constant. 
Numerically the implication is to imagine two such hollow half-spheres,
one whose reference area was twice that of the other, perhaps 1 m^2 and
0.5 m^2.  If turned with its open end towards the air stream the smaller
half-sphere could surprisingly produce more drag and exhibit the higher
CdA (1.42 x 0.5 m^2 = 0.71 m^2) when compared to the larger half-sphere's
CdA when its open end was pointed away from the air flow (0.38 x 1 m^2 =
0.38 m^2).

By itself the reference area is an indication of the change of CdA when
only area is varied and no other factor. If the two hollow half-spheres
were both orientated with their open ends either pointing towards or away
from the flow of air, then the larger one would exhibit the higher CdA
value and greater drag.

"The conclusion is, to compare the aerodynamic drag of vehicle bodies, we
must compare the drag areas -- CdA's. This will always work, regardless of
whether the bodies are perfectly streamlined or are shaped like bluff
passenger cars." Tamai, Goro. THE LEADING EDGE, page 15.



>Looking at my torso alone I get  0.392 & 0.511 on drops and 0.392 & 0.587
>m^2 more upright so it's not just the added area of the bike.

Is there anyway to estimate a Cd that might go along with those area
estimates? Without the Cd the resulting CdA value is indeterminent.

As a suggestion, it is possible that using a reference other than frontal
area might be helpful in studying the effects of cross wind on an unfaired
bicycle, a bluff form.  I don't believe that assuming the Cd to be a
constant 1.0 for all yaw angles can be defended. But there is precedence
for using different types of reference areas other than frontal, some of
which will be a constant at different yaw angles.

It might be a safe assumption (is any assumption truly safe?) that the
human body contributes more than another factor to the resulting CdA at
different yaw angles, and that an unfaired bike might be only a small
fraction of that quantity.

The skin represents a constant for each individual, "... an area in
average-sized adults of roughly 1.6 to 1.9 m^2 (17 to 20 ft^2)". One might
guess that 1.7 m^2 provides a useful value as a reference area of a
cyclist's CdA. Alternately, skin area might be measured photometrically to
avoid generalization.

Though Google returns many hits for "wind tunnel" when attempting to
answer those questions it is difficult to find anything specific about how
the balances work. The following url is one archived article with pictures
of a bicycle in a wind tunnel showing the balance. This set up only
measured the Fx axis.

http://www.bsn.com/Cycling/articles/data-quality.html

The most detailed explanations of balances seem to be descriptions of the
Wright Brothers first small tunnel used to test scale models. Here a few
of the web pages.

You may be right.  I was trusting my intuition that for a bluff body  like
a cyclist, Cd would remain more or less constant, at least within 
measurement errors and the area would be the predominant determining 
factor.  At first glance that's what Doug's data appeared to be saying.
  Right now I'm not too sure what it says. ;)

Again Doug's data could provide at least a partial answer.  It might be 
an oversimplification to assume that Cd is constant but what else can  you
do?  It's relatively easy to measure an area but very difficult to 
measure CdA, even in a wind tunnel.  And don't forget those tantalising 
Fy values when you add the front and rear y forces.

Good advice but who can afford the wind tunnel time?

[quote snipped -- jcs]


The best estimate, as I have said before, is little or no change in Cd.
    A human body is closer to being a blob than to a geometric shape.

Interesting thought but it makes the problem much more difficult.

Keep in mind where I'm trying to go with this.  Namely if I normally can 
go V km/h on a given road on a calm day, how fast would I go with a 
crosswind of U km/h.  The only pieces of information available are V and 
U.
The cylinder model gives an answer with the assumption that CdA is  constant.
I want to do get an answer with the assumption that Cd alone is constant 
but that effective area varies with yaw angle.  It's easy to get good 
estimates of frontal and lateral areas using a digital camera.

It's all just speculation unless we have good wind tunnel data to test 
the models.

So I'm waiting for Doug's verdict, which might be
-wrong interpretation of Doug's data (which I hope is the case)
-Doug's data is wrong, in which case we're up the creek
-Pythagoras is wrong, in which case we're really up the creek

Politics. Bah!

You can reaccess the material at

http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0003/248/index_of_0003.htm

I haven't checked if the new links work, though they should be okay.
Hopefully we won't have to move our "classroom" again.

After reading through the dialog between you and Doug (which BTW thank you
for forwarding, very useful) I spent most of the weekend writing up a new
spreadsheet with three work pages. Its link is included in the index as
Book1.xls.

I also rechecked THE LEADING EDGE for the approximation of cross winds.
Goro's handling is identical to the definition of "E" as is the discussion
of Jones' cylinder model.

Back to the spreadsheet. The first work page determines the CdA-x and
CdA-y values of the unfaired Standard bike and Moulton bike from the data
in the 2nd Symposium paper.  CdA_x is the drag area as relates to the fx
axis. And CdA_y is drag area fit to the fy axis.  CdA_y is somewhat of a
distraction because it would only relate to forces occurring at a right
angle to the line of a bicycle's travel.

On the other hand it is interesting that the magnitude of CdA_y at 90
degrees yaw is nearly double that of CdA_x at 0 degrees yaw. That
difference may help explain why your curve fits where looking better with
an average instead of a sum of fyr and fyf. Given Doug's explaination of
how the load cells in the wind tunnel were set up, I now am willing to
acknowledge that the CdA values as yaw varies are not a a near constant.
Measurements really are better than guesses.

The second workpage on the spreadsheet compares two calculation sets of
Power due to aerodynamic drag; first using all of the derived CdA's from
the wind tunnel data to match up the CdA to the apparent wind angle, and
second using only the CdA value measured at 0 degrees yaw. The two sets of
calculations are strikingly similar. Power values vary by only a few watts
down the column.

The third worksheet contains velocity and force vectors to reference the
input nomenclature.

IOW, the cylinder model appears to work fairly well, but why?

Cheers,

John

John,

October is fine with me.  I'll be in the UK from the 4th to the 24th of 
Sept.  The article looks like it will be straightforward to finish now, 
so long as I don't get distracted by chasing any other fantasies down  any
more blind alleys.  I have to use your pretty diagrams tho', if  that's
ok.

I've had a distraction anyway since plans for a high rise at the edge of 
a park not 100 m from my front door were sprung on us a couple of weeks 
ago.  So I've been busy fighting city hall.  They've changed the zoning 
regulations so they can legally approve it without a public forum and 
without appeal!  We have 10 minuted for a presentation at the next 
council metting.  Fortunately elections are coming up in Oct so we  should
be able to force them to hold a public forum at the very minimum.

Cheers,
Angus

Hi Angus,

A lot transpired this weekend, so this reply is slightly out of date.


> Doug's reaction caught me by surprise.  I would have assumed that he

the past couple of years.

His reaction surprised me as well. The forwarded questions resulted in
deep discussion between Doug and Theo Schmidt this weekend. Dave is
staying out of it though following along. I very much admire Milliken for
hanging in there and making the effort to understand the situation, as
well as all of the emails he sent to you this weekend. There is a general
debate brewing about whether information should made freely available to
all comers or for a price to a few. It is a topic that extends far outside
of the confines of the HPV community. We've just felt a brush of that
storm.



> You may be right.  I was trusting my intuition that for a bluff body

> Good advice but who can afford the wind tunnel time?


One of these months I have a protocol for measuring CdA and Crr with a
power meter that needs to be tested and checked carefully. Power meters
are expensive too, but many times cheaper than wind tunnel time.

Part of that project showed that even the CdA values found in a wind
tunnel are not cast in concrete numbers. I even read a blurb today that
different wind tunnels will return different CdA's for the same vehicle
due to differences in instrumentation. There is a "fuzziness" involved
with these investigations in part due to the complexity of what is being
studied -- air movement. It's still very fun and interesting.




> Keep in mind where I'm trying to go with this.  Namely if I normally can

I'm not completely sure why but the Book1.xls spreadsheet appears to
confirm that the cylinder model has some validity when compared to the
wind tunnel derived drag measurements. Perhaps it may have something to do
with the as yaw angle increases the effects of air drag on the fx axis
decreases. As much as I love to speculate and use intuition (that fun
"what if" game), objectively collected data always takes precedence when
searching for Truth with the capital "T".

Those archives should still be available, but the list itself has almost
vanished as have tech discussions on the IHPVA lists. It would be good to
change that trend, worth the effort IMHO to try.

As of August 9th the index to the reference materials and other links is
now located at the following url;

I am moving the article back in the submission que in order to give all of
us, especially Theo who has been busy dealing with other work, the luxury
of  extra time to review all of the materials. You mentioned earlier about
going on a trip in late August and early September. Publication date for
the cross wind article could be re-penciled in for October, if that is
okay with you.


Best Wishes,

John

Hi Angus,

It is fine if you wish to do the article as a straightforward piece. A
good clear explaination of the cross wind effect on an unfaired cyclist is
important and called for. Coming to grips with the concepts can be viewed
as a learning experience which might make sharing with the readers easier.

I feel that you have not gone down a blind alley, that you may be onto
something potentially useful. This is the nature of creativity; there will
always be the many ideas to discard and the few gems to hang on to.

Hopefully, the zoning issue will be resolved in a way that is favorable
for you!

Cheers,

John
