  <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Measuring Airspeed on a Bicycle<br>
  </h2>
  <small>Julian Gordon<br>
January 17, 2005</small><br>
  <br>
  <p>Bicycle computers have
reached a very sophisticated level considering their recent ancestry as
the simple cyclometer. Top of the line models now measure speed,
altitude, temperature, pulse rate, and power meters are also available
(ref 1). However, at this time, the only practical way of
measuring wind effects is in a wind tunnel. Wind effects and drag are
important in determining how much energy one
is expending, and clearly it would be advantageous to have real
time-determination. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Airspeed determination is also critical to
avionics, and methods of determination have been established since the
&#8216;20&#8217;s. See for example ref. 2. I initially considered the avionics
experience would be a valuable precedent, and the Pitot-static method
has the advantages that (a) there are no delicate moving parts (b)
and that bicycle computers already utilize an air pressure sensor in
the form of
an altimeter. However, I did not have the capability of putting these
ideas together in the form of a practical device. Also, in order to
evaluate a prototype, I needed the capability of downloading data into
a PC in order to establish the validity of the methodology. Once the
methodology is established, a real time display will be useful. I found
a preliminary solution in the form of an anemometer sold for use in
air-conditioning engineering. This device made by the company Extech
has a rugged fan-type anemometer device and a display which
incorparates a data-logger with capability of storing data and
downloading to a PC (see fig. 1). <img alt="Anemometer"
 src="eJournalFig1.jpg" style="width: 496px; height: 446px;"
 align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">It is not optimal for use
on a bicycle, but could at least prove useful for trying out some ideas
and establishing proof of principle. I&nbsp; mounted the two
components on the handlebars alongside my conventional
CatEye bicycle computer to measure speed and distance in parallel.
Thus, the anemometer gives a reading of apparent or indicated airspeed (<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span>)
and the bicycle computer routinely measures and displays groundspeed
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gs</span>).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> is not the same as the
airspeed<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> some
distance from the bicycle because to get this, the device would
have to be mounted clear of any
parts of the bicycle influencing the air flow. This is obvious from
over 80 years of avionics practice, where the Pitot tube is mounted
ahead of the leading edge of a wing and clear of any fuselage parts
that may disturb the airflow. Nevertheless, if there were a monotonic
relationship between <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> and<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span> the undisturbed airspeed one would
be able to derive one
from
the other by applying a correction factor. Thus we call this airspeed
the corrected airspeed or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span>.
Ideally, in the absence of wind, </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Cas = Gs [equation 1]</p>
  <p>Such a condition seldom occurs in practice, especially not in the
Chicago area.</p>
I decided to attempt to average out the effect of
wind by selecting a straight, relatively sheltered course of
about 1 km, and making the assumption that wind effects would average
out by being equal and opposite when traversing the course successively
in opposite directions. Thus, I took the pairwise averages of the
average <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gs</span> and average <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> in each
direction, repeating this at speeds ranging from the lowest compatible
with
biking stability to the fastest I could go. In the following the
averages are denoted as &lt;Gs&gt;, &lt;Ias&gt; and &lt;Cas&gt;.<br>
I set out to determine whether the averaging gave &lt;Gs&gt; as a
reproducible and
monotonic function of &lt;Ias&gt;:
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&lt;Gs&gt; = f(&lt;Ias&gt;) [equation 2]</p>
  <p>If that were the case, then the function can be
used in a calibration procedure, and permit the determination of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span>
from any observed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias.</span></p>
  <p>In practice, I obtained linear relationships between &lt;Ias&gt;
and &lt;Gs&gt;,
similar for similar bicycle types, and also reproducible when done
under relatively calm conditions or relatively gusty conditions. This
first set of data with three riders and three bicycle models is
summarized in Table 1.</p>

  <p>In practice, it is then a simple procedure to obtain <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span> by
multiplying <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span> by the slope
of that linear regression. I had thus
collected enough data with a non-optimal device to convince myself
that, in principle, an anemometer device could be used for routine <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span>
determination. </p>
  <p><img alt="Silva ADC meter" src="eJournalFig2.jpg"
 style="width: 214px; height: 447px;" align="right" hspace="10"
 vspace="10">About this time, a device came on the market, which could
be more
practical. This was a handheld weather station, the ADC ("Atmospheric
Data Center") Summit sold in the US by Brunton and in Europe by the
parent company Silva. See Fig 2. It measures temperature, altitude,
barometric pressure, windspeed and even compass direction. It has the
capability of collecting data and downloading to a PC via an ir port.
It also comes with a lanyard strap. I removed the strap and used the
slot to attach the device to the handlebars with cable ties. The
advances over the Extech device are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>One unit to mount instead of two</li>
    <li>More compact</li>
    <li>Easy mounting.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A disadvantage appears to lie in the fact, that, in order to face
the frontal wind squarely, it needs to be mounted vertically. In this
position, the display is almost unreadable. I therefore investigated
the effect of tilt angle. Surprisingly, the regression curve was not
significantly different between the vertical position, and a 45 degree
tilted
position, where the display is easily readable. These results are shown
plotted in Fig 3. Finally, the bicycle-to-bicycle variation is much
smaller than for the Extech, Fig 4. </p>
  <p><img alt="Fig. 3" src="Fig3.gif" =""><img alt="Fig. 4"
 src="Fig4.gif">To a first approximation, it may
be possible to have a universal <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ias</span>
to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span> correction factor built
into a device, so one would not
necessarily have to perform the calibration procedure described for
every individual bicycle. This would be analogous to the wheel
circumference measurement for a bicycle computer. One can input
standard values for specified tires, or, the more fastidious user can
determine the circumference directly.</p>
  <p>In summary, my experience to date shows no reason why one cannot
have a bicycle computer that will measure airspeed by very simple
means. My plans are to use it to determine drag coefficients when I get
out again in warmer weather, and also to persuade some bicycle computer
company to incorporate airspeed measurement as an adjunct to the other
functions of a standard bicycle computer. Then, for example, a real
time display of the difference between <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cas</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gs</span> will give an
objective measurement of whether wind is favorably or adversely
affecting performance. </p>
  <p>The material in this paper has been filed as part of a US
Provisional and an International Patent Application, which will be
published later this year. The patent applications include more
extensive data.</p>
