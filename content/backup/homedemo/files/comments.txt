They have an awful track record, so they've lost credibility with the public. Some do great work, but others can be the left's equivalents of the <a href="http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism_(United_States)" >neocons</a>: brimming with moral clarity and ideological zeal, but empty of nuance. (Industry has also hyped risks with wildly exaggerated warnings that environmental protections will entail a terrible economic cost.)"<br><br>"Jared Diamond, author of the fascinating new book <i>Collapse</i>, which shows how some civilizations in effect committed suicide by plundering their environments, says false alarms aren't a bad thing. Professor Diamond argues that if we accept false alarms for fires, then why not for the health of our planet? But environmental alarms have been screeching for so long that, like car alarms, they are now just an irritating background noise."<br><br>"At one level, we're all environmentalists now. The Pew Research Center found that more than three-quarters of Americans agree that 'this country should do whatever it takes to protect the environment.' &nbsp; Yet support for the environment is coupled with a suspicion of environmental groups. <i>The Death of Environmentalism</i> notes that a poll in 2000 found that 41 percent of Americans considered environmental activists to be 'extremists.' There are many sensible environmentalists, of course, but overzealous ones have tarred the entire field."<br><br>"The loss of credibility is tragic because reasonable environmentalists - without alarmism or exaggerations - are urgently needed."<br><br>

Though, it should be debated whether the authors' energy model is incomplete by not having taken into account the hidden time (e.g., wages) required to utilize each form of transport.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1367-2630/5/1/348/nj3148.html">ENERGY LAWS IN HUMAN TRAVEL BEHAVIOR</a> (complete article)<br /><br />New Journal of Physics 5 (2003) 48.1-48.12<BR>Published 23 May 2003<br /><br /><i><b>Abstract</b>. We show that energy concepts can contribute to the understanding of human travel behaviour. First, the average journey times for different modes of transport are inversely proportional to the energy consumption rates measured for the respective human physical activities. Second, when daily travel-time distributions for different modes of transport such as <u>walking, cycling, bus or car travel </u>are appropriately scaled, they turn out to have a universal functional relationship. This corresponds to a canonical-like energy distribution with exceptions for short trips, which can be theoretically explained. Combined, this points to a law of constant average energy consumption for the physical activity of daily travel. Applying these natural laws could help to improve long-term urban and transport planning. </i>
