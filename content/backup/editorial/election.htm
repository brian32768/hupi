We don't usually do political editorials on HPeJ, but these are
desperate times. This is my personal opinion and doesn't reflect the
views of other editors or HuPI.&nbsp; Although the election is an
internal US affair, it has a great influence on the whole world, so I
feel justified in expressing my view even though I'm not an American.<br>
  <br>
I think it is extremely important to <span style="font-weight: bold;">vote
the US-Bush administration out of office</span>. Rather than a long
list of reasons, let me just give a couple:<br>
  <br>
Prerequisite to human power is of course human life. With its <a
 href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1305709,00.html"
 target="_blank">illegal war</a>, the Bush administration has destroyed
tens of thousands of lives directly. See <a
 href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net" target="_blank">http://www.iraqbodycount.net</a>
. Instead of removing terrorism, the Bush policies have resulted in <a
 href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/20/kerry.iraq/"
 target="_blank">more terrorism</a>. In order to reverse the trend, not
just the symptoms but the <a
 href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/terrorism.html" target="_blank">reasons
for terrorism</a> must be combatted. Only a new US administration can do
this.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="vavrek.jpg" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 278px; height: 278px;" align="left" hspace="10"> The war
has much to do with oil and the heavy use of oil is also killing
millions of people indirectly through air pollution and climate change
effects. A new US administration will not be able to change this much
but will certainly give better support to renewable energies -
including human power.<br>
