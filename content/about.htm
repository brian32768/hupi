<div style="text-align: left;">As announced in the news release in <a href="HuPIannounce.pdf" target="_blank">Human Power
55, page 5</a>, the Human Power Institute (HuPI), primarly a virtual presence on the internet, was formed in
January 2004 in order to promote the development and use of human power
for an environmentally sustainable and socially just
society. Founders of HuPI were Richard
Ballantine, Theo Schmidt, John Snyder, Elrey John Stephens, Brian
Wilson and David Gordon Wilson. The originally intended projects
were described in the original <a href="HuPIbackground.pdf" target="_blank">background
information</a>. <br><br>An
actually carried out project was the Human
Power Archive CD. This is a complete archive of past issues
of the paper journal Human Power which was produced by the
International Human Powered Vehicle Association from 1977 to 2003. The
archive was sponsored by Dave
Wilson and is fully indexed and searchable. The CD is also mirrored on the internet, <a href="http://www.ihpva.org/hparchive.htm" target="_blank">here</a> by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ihpva.org" target="_blank">IHPVA of 2009</a> (<a href="http://www.hpva.us/" target="_blank">previously HPVA</a>), and <a href="http://www.whpva.org/HParchive/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a> slightly more complete by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whpva.org">WHPVA of 2009</a> (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080204230219/http://www.ihpva.org/" target="_blank">previously IHPVA</a>).<br><br>Our ongoing project is <a href="HPeJ/index.htm">Human Power eJournal</a>.<br>
