Merci d'avoir signalé ce reportage.

Graeme Obree a un vrai accent écossais ! Pas facile de tout comprendre...
Heureusement, il y a une transcription écrite. On se rend compte que Grame
Obree fait une bonne promotion de l'esprit des VPH et pourrait bien attirer
les lumières des médias s'il réussissait à battre le record de Sam
Whittingham. Extraits :

 "Graeme, pleasure to meet you. You have broken World Records before, what
excited you about the human powered land speed record?

Well the thing about the human powered land-speed record is that there are
no rules. Well, there are, it is just one though ? it must be human
powered. I have been banned before for trying to bring innovation into
sport, so the land-speed record was calling out to me, Graeme, knock
yourself out. Go and innovate. It is simple. Go and innovate and build the
best bike you can, and then fire up that road as fast as a human being can
possibly go. That is the sport. Pure innovation, engineering and athleticism
.(...)
You mentioned this is down to ?obsessional behavior?. How would you
describe yourself then, a ?problem solver? or an ?innovator??

If something is possible it impassions me. I am slightly dispassionate
about mainstream bikes now. Not in a bad way. I watched the Tour de France
and all the events and it is great entertainment with fantastic racing. But
I am slightly disappointed with the bike angle of it. Basically everyone is
riding about on a glorified safety bicycles. It is the same bike that was
put in a museum in 1892. Plus it is all regulated. You cannot go below a
certain weight, or width, and that doesn?t inspire me to take cycling any
further. Where is the innovation?

On the other hand the human-powered land speed record inspires me
mechanically. Lets find proper limits of achievability. I set myself within
the parameters of what is humanly possible. But that is purely subjective.
Someone might say the saddle must be 5cm behind the bracket, but someone
might say it should be 15 cm ? this is subjective ? it isn?t the laws of
nature.

What is going to define how fast I can go is simply the laws of nature.
That is it. Newton?s laws of physics. The harsh blood and guts reality of
life ? that is the constraint. It is simple. And that won?t change over
time. In a 100 years, the laws of cycling will have changed, with new rules
and regulations. It is the control which doesn?t inspire me. The whole test
is therefore arbitrary, where with what I am doing with the land speed
record, it is pure. It is not even about battling the other competitors, it
is about battling the laws of physics. End of."

On comprend aussi qu'il va réaliser un VPH caréné couché sur le ventre :

"A lot of riders just want to do the same as each other. They settle on the
one design and they all focus on how to make the best ?supine? recumbent
bike (i.e laying on your back). So I have stepped back and said to myself
?what are my maximum possibilities?? I have ridden about on a ?prone?
recumbent bike (i.e lying on your stomach) in the 90s. In fact I
specifically targeted it, because it really simply feels more powerful
because you are pedaling behind you, and you have the width of your
shoulders in front of you, and you staring straight on ? forget science ?
it feels stronger."

Entre merci à Christian pour ce lien.
