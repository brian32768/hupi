<PRE>New Gear Assembly for Human and Electric Powered Boats
Available for Prototype Testing


Troy, Michigan, April 12, 2010 ---  Marco Polo Boats, Inc. (MPB) of  
Troy, Michigan, USA, seeks boat builders and human powered boating  
enthusiasts to test prototypes of a new in-water gear assembly  
designed for human powered and electric powered boats.

The prototype will be available this summer in four increaser ratios  
and two torque specifications. The range is intended to serve the  
leisure, rental, and performance markets.

Qualified testers will be loaned a prototype in exchange for  
undertaking testing protocols over a 60 day period this summer. If a  
tester completes the protocol and adheres to program requirements, he  
or she will be given a gear assembly when production commences.

&#8220;Marco Polo Boats is excited about this mechanism and its potential  
for inexpensive and energy efficient small boat propulsion,&#8221; said Mark  
Vermilion, president of MPB. &#8220;We want it tested in the real world by  
human powered and electric boat enthusiasts so that we can make  
improvements prior to production.&#8221;

Qualified testers must provide their own water craft with front-end  
pedaling or electric motor, a connecting shaft, and propeller. Optimum  
input RPMs for the unit are from 50 to 100.

The gear assembly comes in increaser ratios of 1:7 and 1:49 (each with  
a maximum torque of 157 lb-in), and 1:5 and 1:25 (each with a maximum  
torque of 200 lb-in).

MPB seeks testing applicants according to the following chart:

Human Powered Category
Ratio				Number of Units	Max. Torque
1:5				4			200 lb.-in.
1:7				4			157 lb.-in.
1:25				2			200 lb.-in
1:49				2			157 lb.-in.

Electric Motor Powered
Ratio				Number of Units
1:5				2			200 lb.-in
1:7				2			157 lb.-in.

Interested parties should e-mail <A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv-boats">testprogram at marcopoloboats.com</A> for  
program requirements.
