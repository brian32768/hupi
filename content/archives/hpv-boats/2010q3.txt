I went out in some blustery conditions today to test my latest boat.

It is version 15 or V15_5m.  I have a few refinements but I think  
this will be the basis for more boats if I make any more for own use  
or for others.  This one has been designed and built to suit my  
sister who is lighter than me.  It still performs well with more weight.

I ordered a purpose made gearbox from Mitrpak for this boat.    
Marcopolo boats have decided to stock some of these modified boxes so  
they are more readily available.

Wind was up to 70kph so not the ideal day for first outing.  I was  
pleased with how it went.  I want to make a few adjustments but the  
changes have all worked as intended.  The wave-piercing bow works  
very well in waves.  There seems to be no tendency to bury into the  
back of waves when running that I have experienced with the earlier  
hulls.

I have created a web page for this new boat here:

A few questions if you dont mind.
What is the weight of the boat?
What does the gear box look like up close?
What CAD program did you use to do the 3D modeling?
What weight driver is the boat optimized for?
Can you show how low in the water the boat
is when the driver is mounted?   Is there any
lift or rise out of the water at all while underway?
It looks very nice.
Thanks

A few questions if you dont mind.
What is the weight of the boat?  I have not weighed it in final  
form.  The bits totaled just under 20kg. When not on it it needed to  
be pointed into the wind to prevent it getting blown away.
What does the gear box look like up close?  There is an image here:
http://marcopoloboats.com/MitrpakDrive.html
Although it shows the standard box; not the one with the square taper  
to suit cranks.
What CAD program did you use to do the 3D modeling?  Delftship Pro.   
You can get a reasonable free version of with no strings attached.   
It has slightly less functionality than the Pro version.
What weight driver is the boat optimized for? The boat is optimised  
for a 60kg person but will also perform well with a heavier person at  
high power.It only takes 300W to do 15kph with a 70kg rider.  That is  
about the limit of the little gearbox.  You need a larger box if you  
want to use more power.
Can you show how low in the water the boat is when the driver is  
mounted? This image shows the waterline with total of 90kg:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_5m_Linesplan.png
Is there any lift or rise out of the water at all while underway?   
The boat starts bow up at about 7kph with net sinkage up to 13kph and  
then begins to lift.  It is not planing but the wave pressure causes  
it to lift.
It looks very nice. Thank you - I hope my sister likes it!! I am  
thinking about modifying V14 to use some of these new ideas.

Thanks

Rick

Since the hull is wave piercing instead of the other kind,
does it still experience the maximum speeds limited to
hull length like sail boats ?

Message-ID: <BF426C67-71E5-4716-B972-7D5034DFE509@bigpond.net.au>

Hull speed is a defined parameter based on boat length and the  
gravity constant.  It does not have any significance for any slender  
hull as there is no measurable wave hump.  The drag goes up in  
proportion to the square of the speed.

The wave piercing requirement only applies to ambient waves; not  
anything to do with waves produced by the hull.  The aim is to pass  
through the ambient waves rather than being slowed down by them.   
This is not difficult with slender hulls but they have a tendency to  
dive into the back of waves when going downwind.  My new deckline  
with the "V" shape at the bow parts the waves neatly and does not get  
forced down once underwater.

Since the hull is wave piercing instead of the other kind,does it  
still experience the maximum speeds limited to hull length like sail  
boats ?

Thanks for the report and link, Rick. Cool looking and wave functional 
creation you came up with! Good strut reinforcement for rough water, yet 
seems to keep folding capability. Suspect you might be sending your sister 
to set records at sea :-)  ?
I see you went with a flex shaft and folding prop on this model as well. It 
appears that the shaft runs free inside the shell, but with a skeg/bearing 
only at the prop location. If so, that is something new as well.

On anothe note, wonder if you ever got the time to test out the idea of a 
carbon fiber sleeve reinforcement on your flex shaft?

explore this yet.

I tried the 6mm sleeve I had on a 1/4" spring steel shaft.  I was  
disappointed because it did not make measurable increase in the  
torsional rigidity.  It is an effective way to protect the shaft.   
When I tested it the epoxy was only a couple of days old so not fully  
cured.  I will do a more precise side-by-side comparison with  
unsleeved rod at some point.

As Mark Drela commented it would have been smarter to use thicker  
tube.  It is much easier to reduce the diameter of the tube by  
pulling it tight than it is to increase the diameter when it is  
loose.  The fibes in the sleeve are running more like 20 to 30  
degrees than 45.

The new shaft is a combination 12mm aluminium rod through a HDPE pipe  
in the hull and 8mm spring steel beyond the tube.  The steel portion  
slots into the aluminium.  That connection is epoxy glued and I have  
wrapped a few layers of glass tape over the joint.  I made a small  
sleeve from UHMWPE for the bearing at the bottom of the shaft tube.   
The tube exits just behind the gearbox so it does not need to be sealed.

The folding prop sheds most weed so I do not need access to it.  It  
is possible to get a bit of weed wrapped around the hub but that will  
usually dislodge by reversing.  Most floating weed gets pushed aside  
by the hull.

Having the prop right out the stern reduced the tendency to ventilate  
in waves.  This improves as I go faster because the boat sits bow up  
a little and the prop goes deeper.  In the 1 to 2 ft waves yesterday  
the prop only ventilated a couple of times.  The side mounted prop  
would have ventilated more often in waves like that.

I have a flexible strut to prevent the shaft from hanging down too  
far - just a simple UHMWPE bush.  It also allows an effective reverse.

I wanted to get the outriggers as far back as I could while having  
the bracing off the wider and higher part of the hull.  Having the  
outriggers near the stern avoids flop roll when running with waves.

I am not sure if I like the folding system.  It puts the front of the  
outriggers near the balance point so makes it more awkward to carry  
than it should be when they are folded in.  It is quick and easy to  
launch but it should be easier to carry given the light weight.  I  
might spread them on the trailer next time.

I will probably convert V14 hull to something similar to V15 and I  
will just use the slide-in tubes for the outriggers rather than the  
folding.

I expect I will be there next weekend but I would like better weather  
to do proper set up.  I will let you know through the week.  I can  
easily  transport two boats now.

I think the involute would fit as it is.  It depends on the leg  
length because the shaft inclines at a slightly higher angle than  
torque box it mounts off.  So the clearance increases as the box is  
moved forward.  A racing version of this boat could have the heavier  
box.  A strong rider should be able to get it 20kph as this requires  
less power than to get V11 or V14 to that speed.  However you would  
not want to try that with the little gearbox.

I have a couple of changes to the design that would make it easier to  
build.  It would not be difficult to adjust the angle of the torque  
box to suit a higher gearbox.  Mine might be a bit too wide for the  
involute box as well.

So far the hull seems to work extremely well in waves.  My rudders  
are a work in progress.  I am using nylon gears rather than pull  
cords and it has some problems at the moment so turning is not where  
I want it yet.

Right now my gearbox is a bit too close for me.  I will leave it like  
that so it might be just about right for you and Ian Knox who wants  
to have a go.

Was this shaft you constructed covered with only a single layer of carbon 
fiber mesh tube?
What kind of epoxy did you use, and did you use the heat shrink tubing 
method to tighten up to the shaft?

Could that angle strength be improved somehow, say by using multiple layers 
set in offset mesh pattern, alternately reversed from a lengthwise 
direction?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <6D5C9EDB-DCD5-4AB1-9104-76EC54ACE580@bigpond.net.au>

It was only a single layer.  The epoxy was Solid Bond 330.  This is  
the TDS:
http://www.solidsolutions.com.au/datasheets/tds_er_epoxy_bond_430.pdf
The bond did not break but it would not have reached fully cured  
state when I tested.

The fibres were tight to the steel because I hung the shaft from the  
tube to stretched it while it cured.

I had intended to use up to 3 layers but the tubing I purchased was  
too small to allow that.

There is no doubt that building up the number of layers would add  
stiffness.  The idea is fine but my initial execution was poor.  I  
would recommend it if you want a torsionally stiff lightweight shaft  
that will bend.  You could build it up on any round section material  
as a former.  It should be a complete seal so electrolysis will not  
be an issue.  The connections would also be epoxy glued.

Rick


Was this shaft you constructed covered with only a single layer of  
carbon
fiber mesh tube?
What kind of epoxy did you use, and did you use the heat shrink tubing
method to tighten up to the shaft?


Could that angle strength be improved somehow, say by using multiple  
layers
set in offset mesh pattern, alternately reversed from a lengthwise
direction?

Thanks,

Hi Clem
Still plenty of room for improvement yet.

I can simplify the building a bit.  I will also alter the back. It  
does not need to be as long to get the aerodynamic benefit and is a  
pain to construct the tortured curve.

The rudders need some work.  I am not sure how much at this stage.   
During the test I ended up with only one rudder working because the  
other worked loose so have to fix that.

I have a slightly lower drag design dubbed V15_6m that I am playing  
with.  The aim with it is to get something with the best high speed  
performance having 100kg displacement.  Something that a good athlete  
could better Olympic single scull times over 2000m.  It is optimised  
for 18kph.  The seat back is more inclined similar to the inclination  
I have on the V14 seat now.

Rick

Wow
Rick, you really are a genius!
This boat is perfect - the result of an evolutionary process.
The folding prop, the free floating shaft, the hull configuration, the
ultralight materials, the sleek pelican design: Your sister will be  
proud of
her custom made human powered speed boat.
Congratulations!

Rick, if you can suffer one more pesky question? This can be answered with a 
yes or no.

Do you think there would be enough LONGITUDINAL stiffness in a tube formed 
from layers of the expoxied mesh alone, to mimic the round section 
behaviour, IF you dissolve out the round section?

Hope this makes sense, as I as my goal is to get the lightest, thinnest, 
strongest, flex shaft possible.

Message-ID: <C730F7C1-C11C-4A41-A607-96E23D60681E@bigpond.net.au>

Essentially yes but suggest leave the former there.

If I was going for really light I would go for aluminium tube as the  
former.  6mm tube is very light and you can hang during curing to  
ensure it is straight.

Wooden dowel would also be OK.

You probably want a minimum of three layers of the weight I used to  
get suitable strength - CF303.  I would go for 25+feet of the 1/2"  
CF9313 if I was doing it again.  With the aim of minimum of 3  
layers.   Anything less and it will be too fragile to connect to and  
handle.

Providing you get it thick enough it has the fibres ideally oriented  
for torsional rigidity while having bending compliance.  Without the  
firmer core it would be more prone to buckling failure so I would  
leave the former inside.

I will compare torsional rigidity today with unsheethed rod using  
same torque.

The sleeved shaft is 24% stiffer while being 6% heavier.

I may have got a bit better if I had been able to get the fibres at  
45 degrees rather than something less.

The resin ratio is about 1.5x so more than you would use with  
multiple layers.  I was aiming for the resin to provide extra  
protection for the CF.

Remember the stiffness is a function of the 4th power of diameter so  
the improvement is not linear.  Another layer would probably get to  
60% better and three layers would be equivalent to the steel alone.

Aluminium is 1/3rd the stiffness of steel so one layer of the CF will  
almost double what you get from aluminium rod.

No-Worries:: the gearboxes suitable for adapting to "Human-Power" are 
plentiful. cheap [free], rugged, but not marinised. 
Angle-grinders provide them, burnt motors with smoothly run-in gears ; I've 
gutted about 20 of them, they are usually 3 to 4 to one, common makita is 
3.3,which I find optimum. The highest ratio I've found is a 9::1, but that 
was 'stripped'
The'trick' is to make an adaptor for fitting a cluster [I use 14-18 tooth] 
onto the shaft where the disc was [maybe remove the ratchet mechanism] ; 
struggle & fight to remove the rotor windings; cut this motor-shaft short & 
make a coupling [about 9mm id]
For a pp boat, have the chainwheel on the right side of a 'crankshaft; so the 
chain passes behind the operator to a cluster [enabling variable ratios]- a 
shaft across to the centre-line, where the g/b increases speed / changes 
direction / feeds aft to the prop-shaft. via a seal & universal-joint.
Use a bigger chainwheel for higher RPM output.
Ok so I made one  -almo0st - figured a better solution - I'll tell you when I 
have it!

Rick

Seeing your V15 design has put me on a new design tangent. I have been slowly making a new proa, one that is lighter and narrower. I have only made the hull so far and have not decked it in as I keep changing my mind. The hull is 5m long and 200mm beam with a depth of 250mm, basic box section with a small rocker on the bottom. 

My main design criteria is to use the involute gearbox and the boat can be setup sitting flat on the beach. With the V15 being able to sit flat and the shaft raised and lowered it is a much simpler way to go. The proa works well but needs heavier beams and needs more setting up, a stabilized monohull has smaller lighter beams and a lot less setting up. The proa is always pushing two hulls through the water, even though the outrigger is long and narrow it is still drag in the water. 

I would not have the involute gearbox permanently fitted but bolt it in and out each time as it's a heavy hunk of metal. The dipping rudders I will give a try as its less drag and lets the boat sit flat on the beach, also they don't get in the way of the shaft.

The narrow hull allows for the gearbox to be 200mm above the deck instead of 300mm as the pedals are over the side of the boat. 

After all that I am looking at a boat like V14 but with the shaft through the hull and bolt on outriggers.

The new boat does not sit quite flat on the bean but the shaft is  
strong enough to allow it to sit on it.  It just springs out of the  
way.  You would not want to sit on on the beach as they may bend the  
shaft.

With your higher ratio you can use a smaller prop with shaft coming  
out even further aft.

I think if you make a seat and torque box like mine you could  
permanently mount the gearbox.  There is a lot of weight in bottom  
bracket, chain, chainring, sprocket and small box.  I doubt not much  
less than the Involute box.  It is just that the Involute box is a  
concentrated lump.  The most awkward part with V15 is the position of  
the outriggers when folded.

Thanks, Rick you have given me a lot to think about.  Those are quite 
impressive measurements.
How thin will the 1/4" mesh go when stretched tight on a rod, as I am 
shooting for about 1/8" on the rod part. That way I can add another layer 
for strength if needed. Can I get small amounts of the equivalent epoxy in 
USA, is my next question to research....

It could easily reduce to half nominal diameter.  The fibres will run  
a little straighter so will increase buckling resistance but not so  
much to torsional rigidity.

If you only wanted to go to around 1/4" overall you might get 3  
layers on something starting at 1/8".  I think you would have to wait  
for some initial cure before putting on each layer.  With epoxy you  
can accelerate the curing by heating.  The other way would be to  
place all layers dry and then really soak the shaft, working until  
wetted out.  The fibres tend to form tiny needles that catch on  
successive layers as they are slid on.  The more damage the more  
needles.

Hi All

I have a 22 ft kingfisher yacht http://www.kyoa.org.uk/k20+technical.htm  I
am interested in powering it partly through human power when I am on  inland
canals etc.

I will also have a conventional outboard for when I get tired!

I plan to make a Yuloh http://simplicityboats.com/yulohpage2.html which I
would hope to be able to use for about 2 hours a day. eg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7MQsdLpWaM

In addition seems to make sense to use your more powerful  leg muscles to
power the thing. I realize that the boat will not move fast, and that it
will be hard work.

The boat has an outboard well inside the boat and I am hoping to be able to
make use of that to install a pedal system.

1) Has anyone ever fitted a mirage drive to a boat this big? With what
results?

2) I am aware of the escargot
http://www.mission-base.com/pedal-power/pp_escargot_photos.html are there
any other large pedal powered boats out there?

3) I have had a browse on these archives, and have seen people making props
out of model aeroplane propellers, would the prop need to be longer for such
a heavy boat?

4) I am thinking of aiming for this kind of set up
http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system I
thought I might start with this cheap gearbox
http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=43541&C=Froogle&U=43541&T=Module
and
upgrade it later if the boat actually moves under pedal power.

Any comments or suggestions?

Thanks

Sam,

I do not know if what we have will work on such a large boat, but  
check out our PlanetDrive and MitrpakDrive on www.marcopoloboats.com.

The PlanetDrive is a gear increaser. Depending on the model, you can  
have increase ratios of 1:5, 1:7, 1:25, and 1:49. They are still in  
the prototype stage, but we could make one available to you if you are  
interested.

The MPB MitrpakDrive is a customized-for-pedaling Mitrpak right angle  
gear box at a 1:2 ratio, like the one Rick Willoughby has started to  
use. We will start selling these in a few weeks as soon as Mitrpak  
completes our order.

I am using a 12x12E model airplane prop (about $7) with the  
PlanetDrive and Mitrpak on a 12' catamaran, and it works great.

Also coming within three months is a flexible cable shaft, which may  
be useful to you if you need to snake a shaft around objects,


Thank  you,

Sometimes, when becalmed, Mark and I would push his 35' Piver  
Trimaran liveaboard with one of the SpinFin equipped tenders.   
Without changing props, we wouldn't make two knots, but the effort  
was still comfortable.  Boats have the wonderful quality of only  
requiring hard work at higher RPMs, so if you want a workout, you  
have to keep pushing hard.
To maintain the same Froude efficiency at the prop, the swept area  
should be increased to compensate  for the decreased velocity, so  
that the same mass of water passes through the virtual prop disk.

Mark, are you using a carbon fiber 12x12E or fiberglass? What brand?
If the E stands for electric, the fiberglass ones, even with a thick hub 
have deflection and breakage issues for the APC brand at 50 watts in my 
gadgets.
Thanks,

Vic

By way of encouragement re. moving a large boat via human power -

I watched Larry Pardey scull "Taleisin", which was 29-feet 6-inches,  
with a 10-foot 9-inch beam, and 17,800 lbs. displacement, into a berth  
at Port Townsend, Washington, during one of the Wooden Boat Festivals .

Slow, but workable, and I didn't get the impression he was working  
exhaustively.

IIRC, he was using a long sweep over a stern quarter without foot  
power, but I could be mis-remembering that detail (foot/no foot).

Pretty impressive to see, ...but I wouldn't want to try it against any  
headwind.

Larry ( Interesting to see this new burst of activity on what seems to  
have become largely a ghost forum!)

Hi  all

Thanks for all the replies. I made my first yuloh today (the thing Larry was
using by the sound of it) I will post some photo's tomorrow in case any one
is interested.

http://www.simplicityboats.com/ScullYulohaboat.htm

I found it pretty effective, It's basically a large single bladed propeller.
I think I will put the leg pedalling on hold for a while whilst I get used
to the yuloh.

Thanks

Sam

Good.  That's the elegant solution, and if you can get yourself  
breathing as hard as you do on a bike, is hard to improve upon.

I've always thought Harry Bryan's fin  drive was interesting (aft of  
the stern, as opposed to the Hobie fin-drive amidships).

Harry used a forward skeg, I believe, on a boat designed to use the  
fin, to counteract yawing forces. I'm guessing that a larger/heavier   
boat would yaw less, and that for a given propulsive force, the fin  
drive wouldn't have any greater yaw component than a scull or yuloh  
(?). if not, this set-up would offer a leg-powered centerline   
motivator with trailing kick-up possibilities in the shallows. Also  
multi-operator linkages could allow shared and/or increased power to  
the fin. (are there multi-operator yulohs?)

i've not seen any mention of possible use of Harry's fin on larger  
craft.

Comments?

Vic,

Yes, it is the APC 12x12E that I am using. However, I am not a  
performance pedaler, so it works just fine.

Sam
In the event you get around to thinking about propeller systems  
again.  You may be interested in something I made for a large  
catamaran.  There is a particular yacht race here where human power  
is permitted as it is a combination of sailing and athletics (running  
up mountains) - called the The Three Peaks Race.

I mounted a gearbox with pedals over the stern of the catamaran using  
a curved shaft.  Picture here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Pecadillo_Pedal_Thruster.png
I initially tested it with an 800mm diameter large model plane prop  
and had buckling issues with the curved shaft due to the high thrust  
load and low rpm.  I then reduced the flexible portion of the shaft  
to about 1500mm and mounted this off a 1200mm length of aluminium  
tube.  For this shaft configuration I made a 4-bladed lightweight  
metal prop that was 600mm diameter.

In testing with the latter set up I got the 8 tonne catamaran to  
2.7kts working within my aerobic limit.  It was surprising how much  
difference having a dagger board partially lowered made to the drag  
due to the offline thrust.  This was in line with my prediction and  
translates to 4kts with two drives.

This year the pedal system was used in conjunction with oars.  The  
pedal system was as effective as two rowers while adding the pedal  
power to the rowers increased speed by about 50%.

The catamaran owner has since asked me to make a system using two  
gearboxes similar to this one:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/OW_Drive_Leg.jpg
This unit was made for a 400kg boat and has got that to 6kts - all  
day speed is around 4kts.  The unit for the catamaran will have a  
bigger prop and deeper leg.  It will be more compact for storage  
purposes than the long curved shaft.  If it tests out well then there  
will be one made for each hull.

I am able to do quite accurate performance predictions for these  
systems based on the hull shape, displacement and the drive system  
design.  For a small yacht you could get quite good results sitting  
across the cockpit with a drive leg below the hull and prop driven  
directly by a chain.  There are some very economical model plane  
props.  This one is similar to the big one I used initially:

Hi All

I have a 22 ft kingfisher yacht http://www.kyoa.org.uk/k20 
+technical.htm  I
am interested in powering it partly through human power when I am on   
inland
canals etc.

I will also have a conventional outboard for when I get tired!

I plan to make a Yuloh http://simplicityboats.com/yulohpage2.html  
which I
would hope to be able to use for about 2 hours a day. eg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7MQsdLpWaM

In addition seems to make sense to use your more powerful  leg  
muscles to
power the thing. I realize that the boat will not move fast, and that it
will be hard work.

The boat has an outboard well inside the boat and I am hoping to be  
able to
make use of that to install a pedal system.

1) Has anyone ever fitted a mirage drive to a boat this big? With what
results?

2) I am aware of the escargot
http://www.mission-base.com/pedal-power/pp_escargot_photos.html are  
there
any other large pedal powered boats out there?

3) I have had a browse on these archives, and have seen people making  
props
out of model aeroplane propellers, would the prop need to be longer  
for such
a heavy boat?

4) I am thinking of aiming for this kind of set up
http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive- 
system I
thought I might start with this cheap gearbox
http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx? 
ModuleNo=43541&C=Froogle&U=43541&T=Module
and
upgrade it later if the boat actually moves under pedal power.

Any comments or suggestions?

Thanks

Sam

Mark, I did find the APC electric props to be more efficient than the 
standard. They seem to have a wider section closer in, so that might be the 
reason. APC also makes a wide version of their standard prop in 12X10W which 
is quite robust and slightly more efficient than the standard 12X10, and 
there may be other "W" to explore depending on your gearing and what your 
goals are. I also found the wooden zinger 10X6XW (extra wide) to be at least 
if not better than the comparable APCs. They are also much lighter, even 
after a coating of epoxy to add strength and keep out moisture.

Hope this is of help.

Vic

Rick, lots of good info on material I don't know much about, Thanks! I did 
use a 0.18" pultruded CF shaft sometime ago until it tangled in a root and 
fractured. It was great, unlike anything else while it lasted, for my 
particular gadget. I am trying for even thinner and lighter using maybe one 
carbon mesh layer, since there is not a lot of torque demand in normal 
conditions. The lighter the lever arm in my application the better. I have 
also experimented with longish tapered spinners fore and aft of the prop, 
made from lightweight FLOATING material. Interesting advantages to these 
spinners when combined with a lightweight shaft and prop, as it introduces 
some upward forces that allow some degree of reverse, among other things....

Vic

Folks,

I am about ready to order customized flexible cable shafts rated to  
200 in-lbs of torque. They are  two meters long, and each end will  
have a 12 mm ID connector with an off center cotter pin hole. The  
cable is 316 stainless steel, and it allows you, within a certain  
radius, to bend the shaft as needed, i.e. a 90 degree angle, or around  
objects.  They are secured about every foot or two to your boat with  
simple clamps (not provided).

This may not be the performance market's ultimate shaft solution, but  
it does solve a lot of issues related to alignment, the raising of the  
prop in shallow water, and the breadth of boat designs in which it  
would work. For example, you could have a straight chain drive of a  
large increaser ratio, and connect the cable shaft, then bend it 90  
degrees to the stern. Or if you need to snake a shaft around other  
immovable boat parts, it may work for you.

I do not have final pricing yet, but I think they will be around $215,  
U.S. shipping included. That's not bad when compared to a stainless  
steel shaft and flexible shaft connectors, especially if you need to  
go the U-joint route.

I really do not know how well these will work in various applications,  
but I thought potential new uses was worth the risk. It will be fun to  
see what implementations the creative DIY hpb builder will come up  
with. If there is a market out there, we may be able to provide custom  
lengths in the future.

Hi Guys,

My email box filled up near the end of the six months I was in India.  I was
so swamped teaching classes and
other chores that  I didn't get the mailbox cleaned out until today.

I am presently at a friend's sustainable farm 100 miles away from Houston,
Texas.  I am helping them out for
another week maybe ten days before heading east to South Florida.  After
visiting family and friends there,
 I will be heading back home to southern California.

I would love to meet other members of the group even if only for a chat over
a cup of coffee and pie.
I welcome invitations of hospitality.  I really would love to see some
homemade human powered vehicles

I love helping folks.  I am good at solving problems - computers, cars and
sometimes personal problems.
I am easy company and would love to hear your stories.  I have a few to tell
myself.

Huggs and my best wishes,
Bobby Ray

Hi Rick
My new pedal boat "FAST 3" is now great at wave  hanging on the wake of 
passing river pleasure boats.
The following mods. have been undertaken;
1.     2 off ball bearing races fitted to prop strutt.
2.     New flat bottomed out riggers set to be just clear of the water have 
greatly improved the stability.
3.      Simple GPS fitted, but indicates very slow disappointing speed
4.    Prop calibrated, indicates 20% slipbased on pitch helix with no 
allowance for angle of attack
5    Peak speed momentery 12kph average 6.8 kph  I think that my cat is 
faster and will try the GPS on this.
6.    Rudder still to be sorted after many attemps.
7.     Folding prop is working well shedding weed, but failed after I hit a 
rock as it jammed with one blade shut.

Your sisters boat looks good, with a good turn of speed for a boat of that 
length.

Dennis,

I have been unsuccessful getting any of my cats to do useful work in any context or contingency. 

What behavioral and design parameters have you introduced to get your cat to peddle your boat?

I think you are definitely on to something revolutionary.

Dennis
I would have expected better than 6.8kph average.  8kph should be  
easy and 9kph possible for that length.  The slip is very high  
indicating the drag must be still quite high. I wonder how much the  
transom is dragging.  Filming a short video of the wake can be  
instructive or watching someone of similar weight in the boat.

Also what do you mean by "simple" GPS?

The 380mm prop I have on the V14 hull has about 3% slip.  The 520mm  
on the V15 is just over 1% - not really measurable but that is  
calculated.

Mike Lampi has started building the 6m version of my V15 design.  He  
is using 4mm ply that will be finished with glass cloth.  The ply was  
machine cut so saves a lot of work making and cutting panels.  He is  
updating his blog on the project:
http://hpb-er.blogspot.com/

I have been pushing the V15 boat to see how the new box would hold  
up.  I broke it last week end.  It failed at the torque level Mitrpak  
advised, which translated to around 350W on the boat.  It was not the  
shear pin that failed but rather the output shaft where it has a  
shoulder to support the small gear.  The ID of the gear is only 8mm  
so it is not unexpected when I back calculate.  This weekend I will  
start doing some long distance testing at sustainable power of 120 to  
130W to see how it all holds together.  That gets the boat between 9  
and 10kph in the current set up with outriggers set a bit low for my  
weight.  Their height can be adjusted but not easily.


If you can email me a drawing of the hull or photos showing the shape  
I can do some drag predictions for you.

Your prop slip figures are similar to those given by the PropSim program.
I will test one of  my non-folding props to see if it is the hinge zone that is causing the problem.
My simple GPS is a Holux 245 which gives Max and current speed, distance and time.Speed/time or distance can be plotted onto my computer.

The term or concept may be a convienent and maybe even an effective
approach to understanding propeller behavior but it is far from
the truth... even though the results may be usefully accurate.
Props are foils that have an angle of attack that represents
the best Lift/Drag ratio and anything more or less ( which
I guess can be quantified in slip terms ) is less efficient.
Learn what the angle of attack is of your prop blades at
various stations from 30 percent to 90 percent of the length
to the tip and see if at a certain prop rpm and forward
speed the angle of attacks are to see if you need to be
using either a larger slower ( or faster turning smaller 
prop with more or less pitch to match that magic angle
of attack.  remember a prop blade  is like a sailplane
wing and the sailplane pilots know exactly what speeds
produce the best lift and least drag for their planes.
( all based on angle of attack for the foil )

I checked out a rigid prop fitted to my small cat and was very surprised to find
that the speeds and the cadence were identical to my new boat fitted with the folding prop
It is quite difficult to get exact figures due to the river current which made a difference of 10% 
based on 80 rpm.
It all ended with a bang when I hit something under water and bent one arm of the prop
back 40 mm.
I have concluded that my props are rubbish and I am going back to the beginning on the design.

My folding prop is slightly more efficient than the fixed blades I have.
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/folding_prop.jpg

I have a prop optimising program that I use for prop design.  It is a  
bit more flexible than JavaProp and I can use a wide range of foil  
sections.

If you are interested in a design I can give you something that is  
reasonably easy to make using stainless flatbar.

It may sound odd but I have seen quite a few people mount blades  
backwards on boats.  They have the curved face facing aft.  This  
alters the effective pitch considerably from what is designed.

I am a sailor and a cyclist.  I'm in the process of buying a 20ft mini-cruiser (for details see http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html) and I'm hoping, in my imminent retirement, to sail through Europe on its great network of waterways. The boat will have an outboard, but I'd love to be able to propel it using a bicycle - for example on days when there's no wind, or if I have a stretch of narrow water where I have to battle a headwind.

Ideally, I would use my road bike, mounted in the cockpit on a stand fore and aft, with a chain on the rear-wheel cog to drive a cog on the stern of the boat, which in turn drives an outboard-style propeller.  Any suggestions as to where I might get hold of the bike-powered outboard kit would be much appreciated.

Message-ID: <54F752A2-AD60-453A-8028-C80455E445A0@aol.com>



We have just received our first shipment of Mitrpak T-102-M right  
angle drives customized for hpb use.

The drives have an increaser ratio of 1:2, and have crank posts that  
fit J.I.S. cranks (all unicycle cranks and most standard bike cranks).  
The output shaft is 12 mm, with an offset groove for easy and  
inexpensive cotter pin attachment to your shaft's coupler.

These gearboxes have many bolt holes for different deck attachment  
orientations, and are rated to at least 75 in.-lbs of torque. Rick  
Willoughby pushed his one-off version to the breaking point, and  
Mitrpak has slightly altered the pinion/gear interface to strengthen  
it a bit.

You can find details at www.marcopoloboats.com. The photo shows only  
the standard T-102-M, not our customized version.

Roger,

It sounds like you are going the route of using a bicycle because you  
wish to disconnect the cycle for land use, no? Do you have the H20 or  
Hunter 20 Fox C?

I'm not sure if it will work for you, but in six weeks I will have  
available to the market a two meter flexible cable shaft engineered  
for aquatic pedal use. It has a rating of 200 in.-pounds torque, made  
of 316 stainless wire, and flexible enough to handle a 90 degree turn  
over distance.

If you used a stationary bike stand, I can envision fixing (weld) a 26  
mm long x 12 mm diameter post to it's spinning axle. You might lose  
efficiency between your tire and this axle, but I am going with your  
desire to use a bike. Then it is only a matter of attaching the  
shaft's female coupler with a 1/4 inch (6 mm) cotter pin onto the  
post, and gradually over a distance of two feet turn the cable to the  
stern. It looks like on either boat you could drill a hole in the  
stern just above the deck, off center and away from the rudder. You  
would fabricate a solid shaft and shaft support at the gradual angle  
you need to submerge the prop. Use an Igus plastic bearing in the  
hole, and attach the cable to the solid shaft just inside the boat,  
again using a simple cotter pin for quick disconnect. This external  
shaft assembly could easily be detachable when not needed.

The cable has a nylon tube around it in order to fix the cable and not  
allow it to slither, You could mount the cable either permanently with  
closed clips or temporarily with clips that can be opened along the  
base of the cockpit at the vertical surface.

Since your road bike has a free spinning axle, you would not be able  
to pedal in reverse.

I do not yet have a price for the cable, but I am sure it will be less  
than $250 US delivered, possibly even to Europe. This system is not as  
elegant as the ShuttleBike, but a lot less expensive.

I have tried to attach a crude sketch, but the email kicks back  
because the message is too large. Write me directly if you would like  
to see it.

Roger,

There was an Italian outfit that did just what you describe on the market
maybe 5 or 10 years ago.  Haven't heard about it recently.  You might try an
internet search for it.

I am a sailor and a cyclist.  I'm in the process of buying a 20ft
mini-cruiser (for details see http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html) and
I'm hoping, in my imminent retirement, to sail through Europe on its great
network of waterways. The boat will have an outboard, but I'd love to be
able to propel it using a bicycle - for example on days when there's no
wind, or if I have a stretch of narrow water where I have to battle a
headwind.

Ideally, I would use my road bike, mounted in the cockpit on a stand fore
and aft, with a chain on the rear-wheel cog to drive a cog on the stern of
the boat, which in turn drives an outboard-style propeller.  Any suggestions
as to where I might get hold of the bike-powered outboard kit would be much
appreciated.

Mark

Thanks for this.  I'm buying the H20 Sport which has the large open cockpit.

Your solution sounds gloriously simple.  I do indeed want to be able to use the bike on land.  I'm planning to put a timber seat across the centre of the cockpit which, among other things, will carry the mainsheet traveller,  I thought I might have a front wheel quick-release axle mounted on it: I would attach the front forks to that and have the rear wheel on the bike stand, with maybe lines from either side of the boat to hold the bike vertical.  If my schoolboy maths is correct, the cable shaft (assuming a smooth curve) would have a radius of approx 1.3mtrs which should fit easily in the cockpit

My original thought was to drive the propeller with a chain, but that would presumably involve two sets of direction-changing cogs, which I guess would take quite a toll on the efficiency of the mechanism.  Do you have any sense of how efficient would a cable shaft turning through 90 degrees would be, compared with a chain and cog mechanism?

Thanks again for your help.

Roger

Thanks for this.  There is indeed an Italian device, called a shuttlebike, with a fancy website showing how it operates.  The gadget itself wouldn't help me much but I'm investigating the use of its key component, which is a flexible cable shaft.

Here's the other option which I mentioned is more efficient 
http://www.akwakat.co.nz/index.php?page=specifications You have the front 
sprocket driving directly to the prop thru chain and gears, so you bypass 
frictional losses of using a tire drive.

That's more like it!  Many thanks.  I think the frame will do exactly what I want, and the floats will make a handy tender.  Terrific!
