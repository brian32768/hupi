<PRE>Ian
He pushed up over 13kph easily but said he realised he has some  
conditioning to work on by the time he got to the other side of the  
lake.  The design speed is 4m/s or 14.4kph.  He should get to that  
with 270W .  When he was bike racing he was working in the high  
300s.  No doubt it will be interesting to follow progress.

I suggested he nurse the blades by staying below 16kph until he had  
worked out what needed changing or setting up better.  I forget to  
tell him not to accelerate hard.  Blades broke the second time he  
took off to do a pass for the camera.  I have tested the new blades  
to static load of 120N, which is 50% higher than I was prepared to  
take the first set.  New layup should be able to take my full power  
so will do some flat out sprints with my next set.

Matt will fabricate a set of stainless blades while he is waiting for  
my improved CF set.  It would be a shame if the blade strength  
limited his acceleration.
