Having spent considerable time now with both systems I agree the side  
mounted prop offers practical benefits and significant performance  
benefits over aft mounted.

Even the offset thrust can be managed very easily by a bit of  
tweaking.  There is also a less evident benefit if the prop is spun  
in the direction such that the prop torque offsets the weight of the  
gearbox.  The boat trims out nicely.

On the third time out I got over 20kph.  I am now close to being  
power constrained rather than limited by footspeed and shaft  
compliance.  The gear ratio is 1:7 enabling me to reduce prop pitch  
which lowers prop torque, hence the amount of wind-up in the shaft.    
The dynamics of this latest drive system will be hard to better.


Did you do any boat modifications before last summer?



That is a great looking boat with a very impressive performance.
I am please to see that you have reverted back to the side drive bent  
shaft system. This type of drive, I feel is
the most practical for launching and retrieving with out a trailer  
plus it can be serviced while still
afloat.
