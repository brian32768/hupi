<PRE>Leaping Lizards, Larry.

I'm not quite sure what you were describing, but suddenly I'm  
wondering about a fin that moves vertically, instead of having to  
react against another fin.  With the right linkage, the legs could  
tilt it for steering, or run it in short strokes for shallow draft.

A lot of fin drives use flex to accommodate changes in direction, but  
that usually gives the foil the opposite camber to what you want.   
Rigid fins on a hinge with limited motion are an improvement, like  
the symmetrical wing sections of an aerobatic aircraft.  However, it  
is possible to get beneficial camber by using spars fore and aft,  
with a flexible material in between.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bob, ever since Harry Bryan's first fin-drive showed up, the  
</I>&gt;<i> graceful swishing of a fin drive and the natural looking magic of a  
</I>&gt;<i> boat moving under &quot;fish power&quot; has intrigued me.

</I>&gt;<i> sight of Knapp's Sea Saber pulling smoothly away with its  
</I>&gt;<i> relatively slow-turning 18&quot;(or so) prop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to see the result of extended, concerted efforts by  
</I>&gt;<i> such a community as used to exist on this site, directed toward a  
</I>&gt;<i> state-of-the-art fin set-up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used to think some split-fin arrangement might best answer the  
</I>&gt;<i> yaw issue, with the fins sweeping opposite directions at a given  
</I>&gt;<i> time (think swim fins on a diver swimming on his side).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also imagined a forward turning rudder-fin actuated in phase with  
</I>&gt;<i> the (single) fin's stroke to &quot;lift&quot; the bow to the appropriate side  
</I>&gt;<i> to counter the fin's yaw force. Additional drag, of course, but a  
</I>&gt;<i> fixed forward fin also has drag, but offers less correcting &quot;lift&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> due to restricted angle of attack, no?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, tossing ideas into the midst of this group has always been  
</I>&gt;<i> fun. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very nice to hear you are still out there Bob!  &quot;High tech&quot; wood
