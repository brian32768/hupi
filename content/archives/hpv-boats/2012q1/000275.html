<PRE>Hi Rick

At the electric boat race, a photo was taken from the rear of my boat &amp; I decided that the wake was excessive so modified the square stern to a point.  This greatly reduced the wake but did not appear to improve the speed which is what you had predicted.
Additionally I completed several tests on propeller tip shapes &amp; concluded that a simple HOEANER tip was a improvement over the radius ends that you have been using, additionally it is very simple to make.
The tips were raked outwards at 30 degrees with a radius where the leading edge meets the tip.
I also tried tiplets (look similar to winglets) &amp; found the performance similar to the rake tips but as these were tried on fully shaped propeller blades I dropped the idea due to the high amount of work required.
