<PRE>Hi Bob,

Well, if we're talkin' mammal drive rather than fish drive, I suppose we've traded yaw issues for pitch issues ;-).

 I picture Parker McCready's Preposterous Pogofoil, and I imagine myself preferring the wake of the swishing back-and-forth tail, over the (turbulent?) commotion behind the up and downer.

I always find your input excellent thought food. Great to hear from you again!

Leaping Lizards, Larry.

I'm not quite sure what you were describing, but suddenly I'm wondering about a fin that moves vertically, instead of having to react against another fin.  With the right linkage, the legs could tilt it for steering, or run it in short strokes for shallow draft.

A lot of fin drives use flex to accommodate changes in direction, but that usually gives the foil the opposite camber to what you want.  Rigid fins on a hinge with limited motion are an improvement, like the symmetrical wing sections of an aerobatic aircraft.  However, it is possible to get beneficial camber by using spars fore and aft, with a flexible material in between.

</I>&gt;<i> I also imagined a forward turning rudder-fin actuated in phase with the (single) fin's stroke to &quot;lift&quot; the bow to the appropriate side to counter the fin's yaw force. Additional drag, of course, but a fixed forward fin also has drag, but offers less correcting &quot;lift&quot; due to restricted angle of attack, no?
