The first of my V16 series design has been built in Maine over the past 15 months and was launched this week.  

There are photos linked here:

The V16 hull shape is more complex than the V15 series, having variable side flare, which reduces drag slightly.

The boat has been fitted with a Gates Carbon Drive belt to eliminate problem of chain corrosion.

The boat uses one of my commercially produced folding props with stainless blades.

Boat is 6.4m long with design displacement of 130kg.  Actual boat weight is 24kg.  The main hull is 11kg of that.

Made a community page on facebook for pedal powered boats.
Its for letting people see what you are doing with your boat such
as cruising, racing, fishing or whatever. There are plenty of sites
covering design and building. Have a look and see what you think
any feedback would be great.

Forgot to mention, type in ?Pedal Powered Boats? in the
facebook search bar to find it. You?ve probably already worked that out.

I'm looking forward to hear/seeing how this new craft performs!  Especially
the belt drive and your new commercially available folding prop.  How do I
find out more about the prop?

Dennis
The prop used on this boat was the test prop sent to me from the manufacturer and then forwarded to Maine.  It performs almost the same as the folding props with carbon fibre blades I have been supplying to a few of the V15 users.  It requires a gear ratio up around 6X to 7X cadence.  It suits easily driven hulls.

I am waiting on a production batch that I expect before the end opt August.  At this stage I am selling them for AUD100 plus mail.  You can email me if you want me to assess the suitability of prop for your proposed application.

The stainless blades carry a bit more momentum than the CF blades so it might be possible to get a higher speed with them despite the extra weight of 330grams versus 160grams.  I have pushed to 19.2kph with the CF on my V15-58 boat but did not have the right conditions for a speed test when I did the initial run using the production prop.  Stainless was my preference as these blades are strong and will not bruise or break easily.    Shinny blades do attract fish so I have had some fish strikes with my first folding prop using stainless blades.  Over time the blades dull so fish strike, if an issue, does diminish as the blades age.

During its maiden test the V16-64 cruised easily at 6mph with the 66yo builder/pilot.  He could do 8mph working above his aerobic limit but he did not try a flat out sprint.  The Gates drive worked well although the maximum ratio available is 1:3.  With his 1:2 DZ box to give 6X overall he found the gearing a bit low and plans to fit a stainless chain to try 7X.  If that suits him better I plan to advise how to re-pitch the prop so he can go back to the Gates belt drive.

I will update on the new boat as I get information.

To help the V16-64 builder set up his stabilisers I took some video following Ian Cassell around on the local lake this week.  It was a calm day and a good opportunity to show well set-up stabilisers.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5nMkikOM88
When set correctly the stabilisers should sit above the trough of the divergent wave off the bow of the main hull with their aft end just kissing the crest of the wave.  Ian's are in the ideal groove between 9 and 10kph.
