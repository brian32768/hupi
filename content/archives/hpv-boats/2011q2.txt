The torque on the crank varies approximately sinusoidally because the  
model assumes the leg force is constant.  The sinusoid shape results  
from the effective lever length of the crank varying from zero at the  
dead spot up to the full crank length at the maximum torque.  This  
applied torque is the red trace that I call "leg drive" - it is  
mislabelled (N); it should be(Nm), being the crank torque.  Note that  
I do not force the sinusoidal motion - the shape of the curve is the  
result of the constant leg force and the effective lever length of  
the crank.  So the more the crank speed varies the more the shape of  
the curve departs from a true sinusoidal shape.

If there was no compliance in the shaft then the thrust curve would  
be a similar sinusoidal curve to the crank torque and it would be in  
phase.  The crank speed would be almost a straight line with a small  
amplitude sinusoidal wave impressed in phase with the crank.  When  
the shaft has compliance there is a lag between the crank torque and  
the thrust.

At the dead spot the shaft is completely unwound, or even wound in  
reverse due to the boat driving the crank.  After the deadspot the  
increasing torque, with little resistance from the shaft due toits   
unwound state, enables high crank speed to the point where the shaft  
gets wound up and starts accelerating the boat and slowing the crank  
speed.  In the curve you refer to the average crank speed is 71rpm  
but it overshoots to about 82rpm.  The slowing from 82rpm back to  
71rpm causes an increase in boat speed over the average.

There is an exchange of energy between the shaft spring energy and  
the boat momentum.  The frequency of this is a function of the boat  
mass and the shaft spring constant.  The more compliant the shaft  
then the greater the amount of energy transfer between shaft and boat  
momentum.  In fact if you look at the second chart I linked to with  
the very compliant shaft then you can see there is some variation in  
the boat speed:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to4%20_flex.pdf
This is similar to the sort of speed variation that you would see in  
a rowing shell that has momentum transfer from body to boat and  
thrust variation due to the stroking of the oars.

If you replaced your steel shaft with an aluminium shaft of same  
diameter you will have enough compliance to reduce your biomechanical  
efficiency and the dynamics will be more apparent.  A good shaft will  
have similar feel to a bike on the road i.e. very well connected  
rather than rubbery.

Rick



Hi Rick
On your dynamic model of crank drive for the V14 hull with 1.4 gear  
ratio:-
The thrust curve has a major dip just after the peak, what causes  
this as
there is not a similar dip in the leg drive.

An update on the pedal thrusters for Peccadillo.

The big catamaran won the Three Peaks Race this year:
http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/25/3199840.htm

The win was due primarily to sailing ability.  They managed a  
slightly faster trip using the thrusters when the wind died in the  
Derwent River on the final sailing leg.

There is a good photo of the cat with thrusters mounted at the start  
of the race here (image can be enlarged):
http://www.sail-world.com/UK/Australian-Three-Peaks-Race-2011-starts- 
off-at-a-cracking-pace/82737
The drive legs are folded up with the big prop on the back of the  
seat.  The thrusters were secured in this place for the whole race.

Charles said that during the pre race testing and up the Derwent two  
pedalers could hold 2.4 to to 2.5kts working on 30 minute rotation.   
The other boats could hold about 1.5 knots using oars.

         Problem I see with using a fan belt is the
slippage. When tensioned enough to stop the
belt from slipping as the prop spins the friction 
losses would be very high. That is most of your
effort goes into turning the cranks and not a lot
of that power turning the prop. Belts such as the
timimg belts used in cars may be a better alternative
as they would give a positive grip without a lot
of friction to overcome.

As Ian pointed out the typical V-belt will have poor efficiency for a  
pedal drive.

I have used toothed belts and they can be set up nip idlers to have  
very low losses.

Nauticraft go a step further using a toothed belt in a twisted  
configuration.  It feels nice and seems reliable.  THere is a sketch  
in this brochure:

Hi Rick and the rest of the list,



First of all I?d like to thank you for your huge contribution to human
powered boating.  I?ve followed your threads around the Internet and it?s
been a great inspiration.



I?m starting on my pedal-powered build, using a fiberglass surf ski as the
foundation.  I picked up a T-gearbox at 2:1, and plan to start with the APC
16x16 prop, a 5/16? steel flex shaft, and chain gearing.  As has been
mentioned, finding spring steel in the US is not easy.  Doing some research
on the Internet, this is what I?ve come up with and I?d appreciate your
input:



A search for spring steel yields several grades of steel, including 1095:
http://www.tmtco.com/products/spring-steel.html



Trying to find 1095 steel, I see that it is equivalent to W1 drill rod:
http://forums.dfoggknives.com/index.php?showtopic=6783



Can?t find W1 drill rod in anything longer than 3?, but I see that A2 drill
rod is similar: http://www.onlinemetals.com/toolsteelguide.cfm



A2 drill rod is available in 6? length and fairly cheap:
http://www.mcmaster.com/#8888k416/ $26 shipped



Alternatively, flexible sewer rod is available:
http://www.flexmax.com/maxlife/cat1.html (MDA-72LC, powder coated) $41
shipped



I?m not sure of the material properties of the sewer rod, but it is nice
that it comes powder coated.  Here is some data on A2 drill rod:

Thanks,

Dominic

The sewer rod is probably the better selection.  I have seen these  
rods in use and suspect they are spring steel but am not certain of  
this.  The end fittings are similar to what I have done with spring  
steel although with  5/16" diameter you do not need to be fancy if  
the connection is not seeing the bending stress.  Irrespective these  
end fittings give you something to work with for connecting to prop  
and gearbox.  So that is added value.  I have paid $60 for a single  
connector before I started making my own.

Assuming they are spring steel then you should aim to arrange with at  
least 3.5m radius curve.  For the 1.8m length you can drop 0.5m.  The  
prop shaft will need to be around 250mm below the surface so the  
gearbox cannot be any higher than 250mm above the surface.  This  
should be easily achievable with a surf ski.  The output shaft on the  
gearbox will angle down at 30 degrees.  If you can get the gearbox  
closer to the water then that is even better.  Obviously the down  
angle of the shaft will reduce in this case.

The surfski should be a good platform.  I have modelled an Epic V10  
hull to check performance and they are a slick hull.  If you have  
something similar it will go well.  You will not operate it reliably  
without stabilisers - CoG will be too high.  For smooth water  
operation you can have stabilisers mid mounted.  If you want to  
operate in waves then mount them toward the stern to reduce flop  
roll.  Use two not one.  They need to be long and slender with a  
volume at least 15 litres.

The 5/16" shaft with 16X16 prop will have very good feel - similar to  
riding a bike.  With the 1:2 box you will need around 1:3.5 in the  
chain.  This is a nice ratio as you can use mountain bike stuff.    
You can side mount the prop so it can be reached for cleaning.  The  
shaft strut will need to be stiff enough to prevent the prop from  
hitting the hull when you turn.

 From a practical use point of view, weight is really critical.  You  
should make an estimate of weight.  Count every nut and washer.  Make  
allowance for paint.  You should target 20kg or less.

As a matter of interest Mike Lampi launched his V15-6m last weekend:
http://hpb-er.blogspot.com/
He has some minor issues to sort but it went well for first time out.

I plan to give my V15-6m its first run this weekend.

Rick:

Thanks for the link to Mike Lampi's boat, very interesting. I noticed Mike 
is working on some steering issues.

Ian from Oz land (I57) has developed a way to steer by using a lever system 
to move the flex shaft sideways. Seems to work a lot better than the 
different rudder systems he has tried on his boat. Prophish also used a 
somewhat different system involving a fexible joint at the prop end of their 
sheathed shaft system.

      The directional prop has its uses, it only works

with a flexible shaft. The setup is heavier than with

a rudder or dipping rudders, the steering arm has

to be strong and the steering lever is longer as it

takes more effort to push the shaft side to side.

The advantages are doing minor course changes

without the rudder being turned which slows you

down. Also for manouvering at low speed it works

well. The boat has a bigger turning radius but if I

lean into the turn and dig in the outrigger I can turn

a bit tighter.

     Another way to overcome the torsional stiffness
in flexible shafts is to use a combination of directional
prop steering and dipping rudders. To keep a boat 
tracking straight only requires minor movement of the
steering arm, this small amount should not overstress
the flexible shaft. For a tight turn the dipping rudders
could be used. Another way is to fit angled rudders at
a set angle on the aft end of the outriggers, they would
be set just above the waterline. By leaning into the side
you want to turn the rudder digs in and turns the boat.
Simple but effective, would need a bit of reserve of 
volume in the outriggers. In rough water could be a problem
with waves hitting the rudders.
Having said all this I'll now have to fit them on my boat
and see how well they really do work, should be
interesting. Have to wear my wetsuit on the first trial.

I'll leave it to each individual, how important "tight turns" are in  
his activity, remembering that we are talking pleasure/race  
watercraft, not fighter planes ;-)

*Note - I'm aware that my "dismissal" of mechanism design/ 
construction issues in the following discussion makes my observations  
"easy for me to say", while actualizing the concepts would be  
anything-but easy!

But let's at least have some fun with theory:

Trying to look at basic principles, it seems as though there is some  
potential for aft outrigger-mounted rudders to be the most effective  
of all, if satisfactory mounting/deployment can be devised.

If we assume that an asymmetrical (lifts better in one direction)  
rudder can be more efficient in it's preferred direction-of-lift than  
a symmetrical (can lift either way) rudder lifting the same way,
... and that any rudder drag offset in  the direction of turn at some  
distance from the hull adds to the turning effect, while rudder drag  
centered behind the hull impedes the boats forward motion, but does  
nothing to help turn the hull, ... and that, if the sterns of the  
outriggers are even with the stern of the hull, and the center of  
lateral resistance of the hull is some distance forward, then the  
straight line distance between the center-mounted rudder to the CLR,  
i.e., the effective lever arm with which the rudder effect is  
working, is shorter than the diagonal line from the outboard rudder  
to the CLR.

Then we see that the outboard mounted rudder has 3 advantages,  
compared with the center mounted rudder, i.e.:

Center-mounted aft symmetrical foil rudder = less efficient either- 
direction turning (lift) effect/ non-contributing drag/ turning force  
applied to a shorter lever-arm..

Outboard-mounted aft asymmetrical foil rudder = more efficient  
specialized one-way turning effect/ turn-enhancing drag/ both applied  
at a longer lever-arm.

Another consideration: Leaning into the turn, and thus immersing the  
outrigger hull to what ever depth, adds "drag" turning effect, but  
not all of it at the aft lever-arm point, and without any additional  
foil-effect turning force. Experiment would determine if the loss of  
hull speed from the additional drag is favorably offset  by reduced  
turning radius ( I imagine a rodeo "barrel race" type of comparison,  
down-to and around a mark, back to start, around and repeat, to timed  
finish at start/finish point).

It would seem more "ideal", ignoring difficulty of design/ 
construction, if the hull could be kept more upright during the turn,  
the outrigger hull NOT immersed, and the appropriate Reynolds-number  
asymmetrical foil deployed "dagger-board-style" at its best lift/drag  
ratio angle of attack, only deeply enough(variable) to give the  
desired turning rate.

Thus we would have the best lift/drag turning force applied at the  
best (long lever-arm) position, to only the degree desired, with both  
the foil lift and the inescapable accompanying drag contributing to  
the turn.

The twin (smaller)outboard rudders and linkages might end up weighing  
little if any more than the larger center-mount rudder. (better  
efficiency / better applied might make up for size disparity (lift/ 
drag ratios and points of application of the force being the  
determinants).

If the twin set-up weighs a bit more, anyone who is seemingly willing  
to carry 30-40 lbs. excess personhood constantly, such as myself,  
should probably not complain about the rudders ;-).

Re. "Reserve volume" in outriggers -   personal opinion only, but  
seems to me that an outrigger which will not prevent overturning,  
once  fully immersed, with any normally expected leaning by the  
operator, is inadequate in the first place.

Comment/criticism welcome, naturally. :-)

Message-ID: <94507E7D-055D-4463-BB24-B476CB78993F@bigpond.net.au>

I had my latest boat in the water for the first time yesterday.
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/v15-6m.png

It was a windy day that was not ideal for the first run.  It did  
prove it is a very dry boat.

The new carbon shaft feels well connected to the prop.  My home built  
1:4 gearbox is also a winner.

I was rushed to get to the water so have not yet measured final  
weight but it is easy to carry complete - the stabilisers fold up for  
transport.  I also want to measure the torsional compliance of the  
shaft.

I am still not quite happy with the shape of the bow from side  
windage; something to work on for the next one.  I have also worked  
out how to build it with fewer panels.

       New boat looks good, see what you can crank
it up to when the weather improves. How much load
can the gearbox take, is it on a par with the involute?
       Always the way when you build a new boat, you
see ways it could be improved upon when finished.
Windage on the side with small boats like these is
always a problem. Hope to see it soon.

It was a miserable day and I spent a good deal of time waiting for  
Dean to set up his boat.  He then got about 100m and a pin in his new  
gearbox failed.  It was a crappy spring pin that the machinists  
fitted after fitting the crank shaft. His latest box is a well made  
two speed hand drill with a double gear set.  Very nice gears but  
only bushes for bearings - also very light.  He has still not yet got  
around to fitting the Involute box he bought from me.

The gears in my home made box are larger than the set in the involute  
box.  So the gears will take probably take higher loads but my case  
is not as rigid so it might flex more.  I think I would twist the  
shaft before the gears brake.  It felt very smooth and ran quietly.   
The weather was not conducive to sprinting and my fitness level is  
more consistent with building boats than racing them right now.

You could also save a bit of weight using a carbon fibre shaft but I  
will work out any easy way to wind them and how much the carbon will  
cost.

The weather is looking good for next Saturday.   By then the paint  
will even be cured.

Rick,

Thanks for the info, I ended up ordering the sewer rod.  Almost ready to
start building it.

I'm not sure how my surfski compares to the Epic V10, it's an older Valhalla
Victory I think.  You're right about the need for stabilizers; I had a tough
time keeping it upright while paddling in calm water.

That weight target will be a challenge, I estimate the boat weighs 16 kg
as-is.  Is the foremost issue transportability?

Thanks for the link to Mike Lampi's build, maybe I can learn something about
laying fiberglass there.

The main issue with weight is transport.  Life is so much easier when  
you can carry the complete boat.  The 16kg is probably right for an  
older style surfski.  Does not leave you much to play with.  I doubt  
you will get under 20kg!

It actually is worthwhile taking the time to plan out what you intend  
to use to build it.

Target weight for stabilisers is 1kg each.  I have used 100gsm cloth  
on 3mm Klegecell foam.  If wood, 3-ply is ample.  Be careful with  
fairing and painting.  They hardly ever touch the water so finish is  
only related to looks not performance.

A seat can weigh as little as 300g.  An aluminium frame taped up with  
glass, no more than 2kg.  Need to be mindful of the load paths.   
There is high force between backside and cranks.  There is also high  
force on the tension side of the chain.  The prop thrust is  
relatively small compared with the crank forces and chain force.   
Having frame located to most directly resolve the forces will help  
keep weight down.

You can use some parts of the frame for multiple purposes.  The  
support for the back of the seat can double as a mounting point for  
the prop shaft strut if you have the shaft side mounted.  If you make  
a separate seat then the part of the frame that the seat bottom is  
mounted to can act as grab handle for bracing against, mounting the  
frame to the hull and provide a place to insert the stabiliser beam.

A little gearbox is around 1kg.

Subject: [hpv-boats] Steering with Outriggers
Message-ID: <EC7C6FF580194475A82AD2C1381FABE0@HOME1>

Tried out the outrigger steering method today, it did turn tighter. I mounted

the asymmetric outriggers the opposite way with the flat side outboard and

the curved side inboard. The rudders were rigidly fixed to the aft end of  the

outriggers, 100mm deep x 150mm long set at 30 deg. Leaning into the turn

I could only immerse the rudder about 10-15mm, if I had leaned any further

I might have gone for a swim. The main turning force came from the shape of

the outrigger, the rudder had little effect. The rudders were set 50mm above

the waterline, any lower and they would have been causing drag from the waves.

With the directional prop hard over and leaning into the turn it is the best I've

had out of this boat. Tried turning using the outriggers only keeping the prop

running straight and the boat was very slow to turn, seemed better to port than

starboard. This may have something to do with the prop rotation.

It might work better with better designed outriggers but the main turning force

came from the directional prop.
