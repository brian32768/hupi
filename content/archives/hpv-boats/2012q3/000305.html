I have replied four times to a specific email from you but I gather  
you are not getting them.  You need to see why your email service is  
not allowing them through.

This was in a previous email.

My CF props suit boats that are more easily driven than the Waterbike  
catamaran.  I have given Beppe performance prediction with them and  
their efficiency is only 78% on the catamaran because the hulls are  
quite draggy compared with a single hull.  There is some reduction in  
drag by avoiding the leg in the water when using the curved shaft.   
The other benefit is that the folding prop easily sheds weed compared  
with a fixed blade.  He said that some of the places they use the  
boat there are weeds so that can be a significant benefit in those  
circumstances.

Cory recently put one of my folding props on his boat and provided  
some photos:

Mike Lampi has continued to tune up his boat.  He is gradually  
lifting average speed:
