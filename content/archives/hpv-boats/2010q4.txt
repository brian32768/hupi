Thought this concept might be of interest:

http://www.hydrovisions.com/

Maybe the concept could be worked to make the hydrofoil run shallow and self 
adjusting at speed. That might get the proa or even a cat to work like a 
single, more efficient hull even in chop. Think it would be better than 
trimaran outriggers slamming into waves?

Also on the folding prop, seems easier to make at least since there is no 
welding involved?

Hi Vic,

So long as you have adequate depth and don't run into any weeds, this
isn't too bad. Around here, however, I'd find the outrigger foil gathering
all sorts of foliage (foilage? :-) ) and have to find some way to clear
it.

Yes, with this foil running shallow where most weeds are, not work to well.

Here's another link showing how some commercial products are approaching 
Rick's design:
http://www.triaksports.com/paddling/

Fairly lightweight and good speed according to the web site, anyway. How to 
convert to prop?....

Have you tried a folding prop with your boat, Mike, and how well does it 
work in weeds?

Thanks,

Vic

The photo gallery claims they were using the rear-positioned outriggers
back in 2005, which pre-dates, or was concurrent with, Rick's design.

24 pounds for the wing seems a bit heavy, but the weights for the floats
(5.5 lbs each) is about right for a commercial standard duty boat built
from standard materials.

With a standard kayak-like cockpit it would require a bit of surgery to
make room for moving legs, though either a Spin-Fin-like drive or a
flexible shaft drive could be incorporated fairly easily.

I have not tried a folding prop with the Cadence. It would probably work
fairly well so far as weeds are concerned, but it would cause problems
with the rudder if one rested the boat on its bottom while beached. With a
fixed propeller the boat rests on the blades, and the rudder is not
carrying the load.

HI Roger,

You have named my dream trip ... please tell me more.  I was going to use a
5 meter sail boat with a cat mizzen rigging as boats are taxed and charged
by length and I am told that 5 meters is the limit of free boats.  I wanted
electric power too.  I had the ideal boat for many years 5 meters and slept
4.  I only needed two but guests are nice.  carry a scooter on deck for land
transport and a bicycle. too.  I would love to know all your details.

Huggs and my best wishes,

Hello,
as far as I know, the 5 meter limit is valid at least here in France.
If you are interested in auxiliary electric power you should have a look at
the torqueedo products which seem to be more efficient than some other
competitors - see
http://www.torqeedo.com/en/hn/products/cruise-r/product-description.html   

I'm not sure to which degree auxiliary pedal power can contribute to move
heavy boats.

This summer I experienced a three day trip on an Escargot, a human powered
boat weighing roughly one ton. The Escargot (literally translated "snail"),
designed by naval architect Philip Thiel is a charming tiny houseboat,
indeed. 
Yet it takes some patience to get adapted to its speed limit. Cruising speed
without auxiliary power (electric) was around 3 km per hour. Powered by 2
adults - each one contributing around 100 Watts. 
For more information on the "Escargot" see: http://www.gruene-flotte.de/

My conclusion from this 3 day trip: 
Human powered boats should rather be lightweight.

Best wishes 
Clemens

The claimed performance with two pedallers is 6.4kph.  Was the bottom  
fouled?  That will make a huge difference on any heavy boat where  
viscous drag dominates.

Also the two Seacycle units are not well matched to heavy loads.  The  
pedal drive I have for the 8t catamaran swings a 780mm diameter large  
model aeroplane prop.  Large swept area becomes more critical to  
achieve efficiency with heavy load at low speed.

A well designed 1t boat should be capable of sustaining between 7 to  
8kph with two pedallers working around 100W.  Typically a sailing  
boat hull will be a bit easier to drive than the barge type hull.

I do agree with the conclusion that weight is important but probably  
not as bad as your experience suggests.  The 5m length limit for free  
passage may be more serious.

The Escargot is a real human powered barge-like houseboat. When I pedaled
the original boat freshly launched on Lake Union many years ago with
another strong pedaler, we were working very hard to get the boat to move.
Unfortunately, we had no speed measuring tools, and there was quite a
breeze to contend with. The large, flat sides and flat bottom made
maneuvering and staying on course difficult.

Note that the boat I pedaled had no equipment, bedding, food, etc.,
installed, either.

In a canal environment it would probably be a good fit, especially if
fitted with bumpers all around.

Clem's trial boat probably did have some bottom fouling, but that boat
would not move very quickly under human power.

Hi Rick,
good questions!
Although I swam in the Ruhr at least twice a day I did not inspect the
bottom thoroughly. I do remember some green stuff and some mussels on the
rudder and on the auxiliary electric drive. These are hints for severe
fouling on the bottom, too.

The "green fleet" of Escargot boats on the Ruhr does not use the Seacycle's
drive units.
Instead, two bicycle pedal units are connected to a single propeller. I
guess the setup is not very efficient - but it sure makes a lot of noise.

Thank you for the interesting data on heavier HPBs!

Two days after our 3-day trip on the Escargot, Caroline and I made a bike
tour along the french canal connecting the rivers Rhine and Marne.
What a sensation of speed!! It felt like flying along the banks of the canal
at low level. Even the numerous locks could'nt slow down our amazing fast
flight :-))  


In August I finally took the effort to start with the new platform for the
Seacycle.
It took a lot of time but so far it has been a good experience and
successful project.
Dimensions are 2.4 x 1.6 x 0.12 meters.
The construction made of carbon fibre, epoxy resin and foam weighs 17 kg,
additional weight is caused by rudder, steering handle and by the wooden
planks (thin and small) on top.    
On Saturday I want to test the new setup on a nearby lake. 
Will send some photos.

Best greetings 
Clem

Message-ID: <59F233E4-E5A0-4D33-BE01-506E34E361B7@bigpond.net.au>

My sister finally got down to Melbourne to test the boat I built for  
her.  She is able to do 8kph at a relaxed, sustainable power lever  
and can push up to 12kph for a minute or so.  The corresponding  
speeds for effort in her Hobie flapper are 5kph and 7kph.  This is a  
clip from last weekend (3.3Mb):
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_Donna_1.wmv
Most of the noise is wind and my outriggers slapping the ripples.   
The gearbox noise on her boat can be heard when she pushes her speed  
up.  As a matter of interest she later tested with my cycling shoes  
rather than the rubber beach shoes and found those more natural  
although they are a couple of sizes too big.  The pedals can be used  
with or without cleated shoes or even bare feet.

I have modified the boat somewhat from the original build.  The main  
change is the gearbox.  The initial box was a Mitrpak T-102-M  
modified for cranks.  I broke one of these pushing the boat up to  
around 13kph and a friend broke one just accelerating - told him to  
stay below 12kph but did not say do not accelerate hard.  The boxes  
fail at the high speed shaft.  I have rebuilt one using higher  
strength steel in the shaft and Mitrpak are supplying redesigned  
shafts that will be stronger than the original.

Irrespective of the Mitrpak box improvements I decided there are a  
few disadvantages to swinging the 540mm prop required for a 1:2  
ratio.  The 1:4 box I have made has at least three times the torque  
rating of the Mitrpak box and allows me to swing a 400mm prop.  The  
box has straight cut bevel gears because these cost less than spiral  
bevel and I was a little uncertain I could achieve the required  
fabricating tolerances with my little mill and lathe.  If I make more  
boxes I will use spiral bevel gears mainly because they run quieter.   
They also have slightly higher ultimate strength and many times  
higher wear life although I doubt the latter will ever get tested on  
a pedal boat.  The box weighs 2.5kg.

I now have to make a few minor adjustments and clean the boat up  
before the road trip to the Gold Coast at the end of the year.

Thanks for the report. On the gear box strength issues, I often wondered 
about some kind of slip clutch mechanism to protect from shock overloads. 
That could save someone from being stranded or being knocked out of a race. 
Something might be worked out with say, super strong magnets to be used for 
coupling the shafts without having the slippage drawback of friction based 
units. I can visualize someone going full tilt on the Murray and hitting a 
log or rock thus breaking or bending something that can be repaired 
rapidly....

The box I have made could only be regarded as a prototype. I use  
standard size aluminium flat and round to make it.  It is held  
together with stainless bolts.  It took about 8 hours of effort to  
produce it.

A friend here is investigating having the casing cast.  This is some  
time off though as I am still playing around with other ideas for the  
gearing.

I have been working with Mitrpak but they can only make a 1:2 ratio  
at this stage.

I also have an Involute gearbox that has a 1:3.3 ratio.  George Tatum  
arranged for their manufacture in India.  I think George still has  
some and both Ian Cassell and I bought ours from India in the last  
few years.  These cost less than  the gears would cost to buy  
elsewhere.   Involute may be able to produce something in small  
quantity with 1:4 or higher ratio.

The Involute boxes weigh 3.8kg which is quite heavy but they are  
tremendously strong.  I expect the shafts would shear before the  
gears fail.  The gears I used are good for peak power somewhere over  
500W in normal boat application but a strong cyclist can exceed this  
quite easily.  I have been told sprint cyclist can shear standard  
shafts.

Hello Rick,

As always your writing is quite interesting.
As you know, I am working on a human power rotomolded kayak project  
with a rigid
shaft directly set on the gearbox.
As the propeller is located below, and protected by 2 keels, it is  
not possible
to set a big propeller, that?s why I tend to put a 1:4 box and an  
average size
prop (rather 340 mm in my case).
I currently build myself this box for the time being but it is  
difficult and
time consuming. That?s why I would be enthusiastic to be able to buy  
one.
Would you have some pictures of your 1:4 box and an idea of its  
selling price if
ever?

Many thanks, David,



Best regards,

David Adrian

Hello Everyone,

In response to David Adrian's interest in drive units we have some used
Nauticraft drive units for sale - ranging from $200 to $500 - shipping not
included of course. (Our new ones are $650.)  These units would include our
15 in.  (385mm) two blade propeller (custom injection molded for us) but no
drive shaft (we now use 3/4"  acetal (POM) rod for the Escapade but support
it in several places; our Encore has 1 1/8" od aluminum tubing shafts).  A
3/4" diameter seal/bushing is also included.  The ratio is 1:4 (21: 84 tooth
sprockets).  Keep in mind that our drive system is designed for recreational
boat use - not ultimate performance.  Contact myself or Laurie.

Curt Chambers
Nauticraft Corp.
