The following links show progress on a couple of new pedal boats  
under development.

This one is a video of a Melbourne local with his second pedal boat:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB13MWTbCuo
  It is made from the hulls of his first boat, originally a small  
sailing catamaran.  He cut the original hulls such that he could use  
the ends of one hull and the centre of the other to make a single 5m  
long slender hull.  He cut down the sides of the hulls to reduce  
weight but the freeboard is now very low.

This is Cory Shaffhausen's blog giving some good detail on his second  
boat he is now building:

Cory has made modifications to the V15-6m design based on recent  
learning with Mike's and mine plus incorporating his own requirements.

Rick:

Thanks for the links. That gearbox on the Melbourne boat looks to be quite 
compact!

Rick
       He was really flying in the V7, just leaned
a bit too far the wrong way.
      Make sure no one puts it on funniest home videos!
