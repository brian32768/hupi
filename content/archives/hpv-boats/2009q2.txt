We are doing house cleaning on the server and my guess is no one would
miss this list if it went away.

While there may not be a lot of activity it would be a shame
if access to the archives went away.  Is there access to the
archives?   Is there any other mailing list or forum where
human peddled boats are discussed ?

I wondered the same...

I know there was a bit of a migration to boatdesign.com but I was hoping
that the warmer weather was going to bring out the boating.

There was a recent flurry of activity from parties interested in the  
SpinFin molds, but nothing got built.  The ice is still on the better  
lakes up here.  I do wonder sometimes if the archives  from the old  
"hpv-boats at ihpva.org" list are available.

Hello Brian,

I would miss it.

Participation and contribution have always varied considerably with 
time on this forum.

When some of the more high-powered contributors defect to a different 
forum, those wishing to benefit from their input, out of necessity, 
can be expected to follow.

However, IMO, the atmosphere of this forum has been unique, 
occasional warts and all,...and more than that, for years it was THE 
forum for the home-designer/builder of hpb's.

The atmosphere I mention depends, of course, on the personalities who 
make up the forum at any given time. The fact that some of the most 
productive and knowledgeable members have taken up residency 
elsewhere may mean that participation here will never reach former 
levels.

But it seems to me that there has been a maturation of the 
field,...and as more people with higher math skills have appeared in 
the forum, and computer programs have been developed to do much of 
the hull/prop, etc. design work,the "fun" of relative amateurs 
playing with ideas and experimenting has to some degree been lost. 
I.e., "Its been done" is increasingly a valid, if discouraging 
observation.

This forum served well for a long time, and perhaps could be 
maintained as more of an "entry level" site for those only beginning 
to explore hpb concepts, ...while the higher-tech design forums are 
offering "state of the art" info for those best able to make use of 
or contribute to it.

I am remembering that apple-box scooters with skate wheels nailed on 
the bottom are a lot of fun for those not at the forefront of 
ever-advancing vehicle design. I would feel that something had been 
lost if there were no place where these people could feel "at home". 
I am sure that nearly all of the most advanced among us can remember 
the thrill of discovering and meeting the many challenges encountered 
in the "early days" of participation in the field. A certain spirit 
of "play" diminishes as envelope pushing demands always higher 
education/more specialized skills/exotic materials, etc. The 
acquisition of these elements can become a serious, rather than a 
lightly-taken endeavor.

The archives of this forum contain a treasure not to be indifferently 
discarded. Not the Library of Alexandria, perhaps, but a wealth of 
material of interest for everyone who is building an education, 
rather than attempting to jump in at the cutting edge.

Two cents from a long-toothed member.

Best wishes to all,

Larry

There has been little activity but I still monitor the site and dig  
into archives now and then.

There are some pedal power threads in BoatDesign and I think more  
people are at least thinking about this sort of boat.  I promote the  
idea there.

I am on to V14 now.  It will be my last pedal boat.  I am fairing the  
hull this weekend,  It is carbon fibre composite.  Before I started  
fairing it weighed in at 9.9kg.  Fairing and paint will add about  
2kg.  Linked picture shows the hull formed up before deck was placed:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/v14_Formed.jpg

I have made carbon fibre frame and outriggers for the latest boat and  
they are in use on V11J.  The frame with seat, gearbox and crank  
weighs 4kg.  Each outrigger weighs 1kg.  You might see I am anal  
about weight but I have found 15kg is infinitely easier for me to  
carry around than 25kg:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_CF_Frame.JPG

This is a rendering I did for a heavier rider for operation in more  
open water:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/KA77.jpg

I have had a young rider on V11J who can hold 16kph over 1000m.  He  
could go further but runs out of lake.

Hi Rick,

It is good to hear from you again.

Did you make your own CF skin panels for V14? Are they single layers
or a sandwich?

Also, it appears to have the same or at least similar lines to V11.
Is it a CF clone?

Best regards,

Michael Lampi

Hi Bob,

Just out of curiosity, what would be the "all-up" cost of making a Spin-Fin?

Better still, what would the cost be for a version that used an
integrated right angle gear box rather than a twisted chain,
where the gearbox housing was part of the SpinFin itself?

This would be similar to the WaveWalker drive system, and would
probably be a little beefier than your original drive.

Hi Rick,

Have you thought about using fiberglass or possible CF for the drive
shaft instead of steel? You might save some weight there.

I don't know.  A couple of hundred hours at racing speeds between  
quick, cheap re-builds seemed like beefy enough to me.  I'm sure that  
equal-quality gears would put the cost up.

Best,

I made the CF panels at home.  This boat is 6m long and is not a  
clone.  It is designed for flat panel construction and shape is  
optimised for this.  It should require 2% less power than V11J  
because I can build it about 8kg lighter.  A hard chine hull is not  
quite as efficient as a rounded chine but it is much faster to build  
unless you have a mould and, if lighter, it can be a better overall  
boat.

I do not use vacuum bagging for my panels but this is no doubt the  
best way.  I lay out cardboard on a flat concrete floor and this is  
covered with plastic.  I then place the sheets of klegecell (Corecell  
would be better), spread epoxy over these then roll out 200gsm bi- 
axial CF cloth.  This is then liberally coated with epoxy. A thicker  
coating of epoxy on a light layup improves compressive strength  
immensely so is worth the weight.  I then lay a smooth layer of  
plastic over the CF and place chipboard sheets on top of this.  Final  
step is to load the boards with weight.  (I do not have a vacuum pump  
and cannot stand running a vacuum cleaner until the epoxy cues.)  I  
repeat the process after rolling the panel over but only after the  
first side has cured.

This is a very good method of construction and gives drum like  
strength.  You can get a basic hull built with about 8 hours effort.  
The time for curing takes much longer of course.

Greg K is presently building his ocean boat and is using flat panel  
construction.  He is being helped by a fellow who does CF parts for  
aircraft but not to recognised standards so I have given Greg some  
ideas on testing the panels to ensure quality control.  The test  
panels they made were quite good on test.  If you track back through  
his blog you will get some details:
http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/HPB/HPBmain.html


Hi Rick,


It is good to hear from you again.

Did you make your own CF skin panels for V14? Are they single layers
or a sandwich?

Also, it appears to have the same or at least similar lines to V11.
Is it a CF clone?

Best regards,

Michael Lampi

I have thought about it.  The CF would probably not be as good as  
fibreglass.  I have tried CF tent poles for shafts but the fibres are  
not oriented for carrying shear.  I have intentions to wrap a 1/4"  
spring steel shaft with fibreglass tape and test that.  The  
fibreglass would carry most of the torque.  The steel would primarily  
be the former.   The fibreglass should protect the steel from corrosion.

I have been working on my solar boat design.  I have started testing  
the componentry.  I need to get my hands on a nice solar panel and  
see what it can do.  If I keep making pedal boats I will not get to  
do what I always planned to do.  Pedal boats are my large scale  
models for something big enough for coastal cruising.

I have posted some details there.  I went down one path for quite a  
bit.  Even got some rough scantlings done but then a fellow provided  
a new direction that I have been exploring.  It is very promising.

The boat sketched on this link will do 8kts with 900W if I can build  
it to target weight:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/swt_8m.jpg
I have dubbed it a faux-tri because it is a monohul with outriggers  
underwater but looks like a standard monohull topside.  It has better  
accommodation and is shorter than the previous attempt.  It uses many  
of the ideas I have got from pedal boats.  This is partly why I am  
making a flat panel pedal boat because the solar boat will use this  
method and I want to know what is involved.   With the Mars motor I  
currently have this boat should see about 14kts at full tilt.  The  
batteries would drain quickly at this pace though.  I have priced  
lithium batteries and intend to play around with a small battery on  
one of the pedal boats.  We have a solar boat challenge in Australia  
and I might convert a pedal boat to run in this as an interim step.

I am yet to see if it can be built within the weight target.


Rick, I hope you'll keep us posted on your solar boat though, even if

Hi Rick,

Can you explain a bit about the underwater outrigger concept, or link 
to where it has been discussed?

I'm guessing the idea is to avoid choppy water aka-ama wave impact 
and surface wave-making,...but am puzzled about the roll-countering 
effect without the buoyancy/leverage advantages.

Thanks,

Larry

I've done OK using salvaged refrigerator compressors as vacuum  
pumps.  With no internal flow, they heat up, but wet rags wicking  
moisture from a tray, and sometimes a small fan, will keep them cool  
enough. I recommend "dry bagging" using a squeegee to move excess  
resin to the vacuum ports, which are equipped to collect it safely.

Best,
Bob Stuart

The idea with the faux-tri is to get a slender hull in the water but  
use outriggers just above the water level for stabilising.  The top  
part provides more room than a long slender hull but is shorter and  
more practical for a trailer.

The linesplan on this link might give you a better idea. From the in- 
water perspective it is just a heavier version of V11J.

I couldn't see the merits of "outriggers underwater". Of course if 
the boat looks like (rather than is) a "monohull with outriggers" 
when seen from "underwater", I read you clearly.

Rick, saw your rendering for a decked in boat for use in open water, would the seat well be self draining? I have taken my boat out on the bay 4 times now ,on calm days with the biggest waves at 6". Even then it behaves like a submarine, its hardest to handle going before the waves at a 45 deg angle as the boat digs in . Maybe a surfski with a drive leg and two outriggers might be the best layout for an open water hpb as the surfski is a proven design and have the outriggers the same as for an OC1.

Having had quite a bit of experience with pedal boating in water
with waves of up to 8 feet, I generally concur that a pedal boat
with a minimal or no cockpit (or at least a self-bailing one) and
flying amas would generally be the best configuration.

Even with a surfski hull you can find the bow and/or stern digging
into the waves. You just don't want them to stay there.

The Cadence configuration with outriggers has worked out pretty well,
with a propeller directly in front of the stern rudder. That
configuration works far better for maneuvering in the big waves than
one where the prop wash and the rudder are separated by several feet.

Once out in open water, I never have trouble maintaining enough way  
for steerage.  However, when surfing, I have sometimes wound up with  
my rudder in the air.  A deeper blade seems to help.

If the deck is self draning then driving down waves does not matter much.  You just get very wet.  I am surprised you have problems in 6" waves.

V11J can be driven into the back of waves maybe 0.4m high and higher.  I have had the bow submerged for about 2m of its length and believe I could push it deeper if I kept powering.  This hull has virtually zero rocker, a rounded section forward, no hull flare and the same reserve buoyancy bow and stern.

The design for V14 has a flat entry at the bow with quite a lot of rocker that should provide dynamic lift.  The bow is flared and almost 200mm above water level so as it is pushed deeper it will gain considerably more buoyancy.  The stern has very lttle buoyancy so will have little tendency to lift in a following sea. Keeping the stern low helps in keeping the bow up. 

I expect V14 will behave better in a following sea than V11J.  I will have some comparison in a few weeks.  

There could be some advantage in having outriggers with ability to lift but I do not do enough rough water testing to comment from actual experience.  

The OC1 does not bury the bow in a following sea.  Going to windward it takes water into the footwell, which does not self-drain so this is annoying.  Its banana shaped outrigger has a tendency to tip the boat when you travel downwind because it sets up a roll.  Would be better with two outriggers. Despite the bow burying nature of V11J it is a safer boat in "rough" water than the OC1 with a single outrigger.

        Am being cautious out on the bay, I go from
Patterson River, if its too rough I stay in the river.
Boat has 100mm freeboard so is very wet and dives
into every wave. I have fitted a breakwater and this helps,
I thought of moving the outriggers further forward so 
when running down the waves I would get better lift
and not keep diving.
         The flex shaft is working well but when I try
peddling hard I can feel a dead spot, like I can't push any harder. 
         I have been thinking of getting a 1:1 right angle
gearbox and joining it to the involute gear box to make a
drive leg. Advantage would be launch and transport a
lot easier. But more drag and sealing the underwater
gearbox might be a problem.
        Went to the lake last Saturday and its the worst
it's been for weeds, had to stop at least 4 times to clear
them.

The lake will be a mess unless Melbourne gets good rain.  The weed in the northern half is now growing to the surface.   I will use it for testing but will be travelling further for exercising unless it gets deeper.

Late this summer a few of us here at SIGAL Construction are competing in
the Associated Builders & Contractors "Boat Battle". The boats are to be
constructed of materials that are used in construction (with a little
leeway). The basis of our design is the pedal/pontoon boat from the 1953

pinion from a differential. We really need some help with the propeller.
Can they be purchased from a fabricator or does each builder make their

I've done fine with model airplane props, but they have to be geared  
up at 1:7 or higher.  A few large, coarse-pitch props have been sold  
between friends.

After winning one instant boat competition too easily, the use of  
metal roofing and duct tape for hull construction were banned there.   
The keel usually comes out hogged, but it is still very slippery, and  
the extra tracking ability can be an advantage with sails.

Best,
Bob

Bolly produce a boat prop that has a decent pitch:
http://www.bolly.com.au/models/glasstwo.html
It is about midway down the page. The 15 X 25.  This is very strong.   
It will suit providing the hull moves easily.

The best boat will be a long slender stabilised monohull.  The hull  
about 7m long and 10 inches wide if it is a single pilot.  Use  
outriggers on either side to stabilise but set them on the loaded  
water level.  They should only kiss the water in operation.

You can make a prop in about 4 hours using mild steel with a welder  
and grinder.  If you want to have a go then I can lead you through  
the process.

This place has some solid model plane props that might do the job  
with the right gearing:
http://www.hobbycity.com/hobbycity/store/uh_viewItem.asp? 
idProduct=8081&Product_Name=Master_Airscrew_propeller_16x10
You can see it will need to spin about twice as fast at the Bolly  
boat prop at the same speed.  If your boat is not very efficient then  
this prop could be more suitable.  Hobby City have heaps of props but  
this about the best they have for a single person pedal boat.  If you  
can find one of similar diameter with larger pitch then that will be  
more suitable.

I finished V14 today and took it for a short run.

It gets to 11kph quite easily.  Probably a little harder to get to  
above 12kph than V11J but then has a higher top speed.  I have  
already hit 17.3kph without any tuning.

I have some pictures here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V14.htm

The bare hull ended up weighing 11.5kg after painting.  With rudders  
and drive frame it is 19kg.  The outriggers add 3kg more. I have made  
the outriggers plug-in so they are transported separately to the main  
hull.  The main hull is light enough and ballances well enough to be  
carried in one hand using the frame as a handle.

I kept a tally on the time to build the hull.  I did it over 5 week  
ends but actual work time was 38 hours.  Most of the time was waiting  
for epoxy or paint to cure.

A rough breakup of the time is:
Weekend 1: Make CF-Klegecell flat panels including cutting - 10 hours
Weekend 2: Build stations frame and join panels - 8.5 hours.
Weekend 3: Fair the hull - 4 hours
Weekend 4; Sand hull, set mounting points - 4.5 hours
Weekend 5: Paint and fit drive and rudders - 11 hours

I have photos of what I did but there are much more detailed ones here:
http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/HPB/HPBmain.html
Greg has employed a fellow competent with CF layup although not an  
experienced boat builder.  He is doing a nice job.  Of course this  
boat will be 4 to 5 times heavier than mine.  Estimate for the bare  
hull is 52kg but it has three separate watertight compartments, is 8m  
long and almost 1m beam.

My panels are very simple with just one layer of 200gsm biaxial CF  
either side of 3mm foam.  Even this is very stiff although less than  
4mm thick overall.  I used 450gsm glass tape on the outside of the  
bottom seam to give it some wear resistance.  It added a bit more  
weight but it means I can treat it roughly without fear of damaging  
the CF.

This whole boat does not have a weld in any of the parts.  That is a  
first for me.  I bought an expensive TIG welder and now I am not  
using it!  Actually the prop is fabricated stainless steel so some  
welding there.  I do have a CF Bolly prop I could try on it.  Still  
to make my folding prop.

Do you rise up in the water at all during your hi speed

hull shape a battle ship nosed shape.  I guess there
are no planeing  forces that would create any lift
at speed.  It that what has been proven the fastest for
our type boats ?

I have a dual pontoon hydrobike that I envisioned

I think I am getting some lift above 15kph as it seems to respond  
well to higher power level.  It is a flat on the bottom but very  
narrow.  It also has a canoe stern, which would not offer much lift.   
It would take about 2kW to get it fully on the plane.  I can generate  
about 600W so a long way short.

If you were going to make a planing hull your best option would be  
something about 3m long with a shallow 'V' of say 5 degrees.  You  
would locate your body about 1m from the stern.  The hull would have  
about 0.6m beam and the transom would be full width.  If you built it  
really light so total weight was around 90kg you might get it to  
plane if you could produce about 1.2kW.  This power level is not  
beyond a sprint cyclist but well beyond most.

There is no doubt that you can fly with good foils.  Again it is  
really important to build light.  I have corresponded on this aspect  
with Mark Drella and he believes they needed about 220W as the  
minimum power to fly faster than you can go in an optimised  
displacement hull.  You need to design well to achieve this but  
having good foils is a starting point.

Hey Everybody,
 
 
Looks like this list is lighting up.
 
 
I dunno how active I'll be in the near future. All my web-energy is towards 
reinstalling the site. The host that I was under has gone out of business. 
The site is back up, but I have much to do in reconnecting the links and 
posting the rest of the pages. 
 
Went from Elkhart to Bristol the other day via water. It was the first time 
I took a deep draft boat up that far. The last time we went upstream we 
were at the Fun Ride of the Shutt Memorial Hydrobowl. We got stopped by sand 
bars about a third of the way up. This time there was good storms in March and 
Spring runnoff. Went 17 miles without qan incident. 
 
There is usually an athletic festival here over Memorial Day called the 
"Great Race" that has been held for the last thirty years. I'd usually do a 
couple of the events, usually the canoe, always the swim. On a couple of 
occasions, I'd take the rig down the Elkhart River if the usually "marshy" water 
was in rare form and deep enough.
 
The great race has gone out of business, so I'll be itching to try 
something over the holiday. The St Joe has dropped a foot so we'll have to see (my 
big hawg propellers usually draw a couple).
 
Also, I think Daniel has an event on Father's day. If I'm around, I might 
take a stab. It's in St Joe MI; the more the merrier, but let's make sure 
he's doing it.

Message-ID: <bf4.4de7775a.3748cd7f@aol.com>

To all who are creating the din on "flying" outriggers:
 
Continuing the dialogue of making outriggers touch less and less, and 
considering having one in and the other out, and so on,
 
The absolute best way to counter the tipping moment of a long unstable  
monohull is to use AMMAVONS. Counter the tipping moment with a surface skimmer 
"sweep" and completely retract them when there is no tipping. That is the 
best solution with the least drag. 
 
It is the absolute coolest feeling to be surging forward with only the 
monohull in the water in between corrections made from swivel-retractable 
outriggers.

Hi Jake,

Can you provide images(or a link to some)?

When and how are the sweeps activated?

Thanks,

Salut Philippe

I'm currently based in Brittany, but would love to be involved in your human
powered boat speed competition. I'm currently asking myself which large
scale event this can be, is it Brest 2010?

Aside from my interest in HPB's I also work as a translator French - English
so if I can be of any assistance then I am very happy to do so.

Yours

Alex Richards

Hello Alex,

Perhaps you can help me with a bit of translation ;-)

Please pardon my ignorance regarding this statement from Philippe:

"I am part of the organizing committee of a large scale event (>100.000
>  visitors) in France in 2010"

I have been puzzled for some time  by the custom of using the decimal 
point or "period" as has been done by Philippe.

In America, the figure, as he gives it, would indicate one hundred 
and zero thousandths visitors.

I take it he means one hundred thousand visitors.

How do the French indicate decimal fractions 
(tenths/hundredths/thousandths, etc.)?

Thanks,

Larry

Hi
Yes, I meant 100 kilo visitors, or 100000
French write thousands in this way : 100.000 and decimals in this way
0,2

This is intended for Rick, whom with his vast computor design knowledge can clarify this design query.
I am considering building from 4 mm ply, a hard chined mono-hull similar to the V14.
My question concerns the stern, should this be pointed in plan view like the V14 or cut square and maintaining the width of the boat.
This is shown on site www.trimalite.eu 2008 photos or Mike Lampi's Cadence.
The boat project is intended for distances of 8 km or more & I am not interested in the absolute top speed for 100 m sprints.

Greetings All,

 

I was just reading the archives and was concerned with the "Still Alive"
thread as I'm just now gathering information for a boat or boats I want to
build.  Maybe with my many novice inqueries I can stir a little more
activity.  

 

So a couple of questions about the list:  I only noticed archives for 2009,
is this all there is?  Are the archives searchable someplace?  Was the list
only started this year?  I suspect not.  

 

That will do for now on this thread.

Thanks,

Ken

Dennis
The so-called canoe stern is the most efficient hull form for  
displacement mode.  This is the operating mode for low power that  
humans can generate for the period of time to cover 8km.

If you can produce something like 20W/kg of body weight during a  
sprint then you could get a very light boat to plane.  In this case a  
wide transom would be best and the boat would be quite short.  It  
would not be very good for lower power long distance operation though.

V14 has a flat bottom although it is only 200mm wide at the maximum.   
It has quite a lot of rocker in the hull and tends to lift at speed.  
I got it up to 18kph yesterday after I had done a training stint of  
20km so my legs were not at their strongest. It responds better to  
power than V11J.  I would have been producing around 500W for the  
sprint yesterday.

A great feature of the V14 hull is the ease of flat panel  
construction.  It can be built very quickly.  In 4mm ply it will be  
nice and light and strength should be OK. Using fibreglass tape on  
the seams will make it nice and tight.

Message-ID: <7AA8762819A24DE2839DA4933C279E15@KensDell>

Hi All,

 

I'm planning to build a small pedal powered catamaran, so I will need a
right angle gearbox.  I have seen this one on the net:

 

http://www.mitrpak.com/product_datasheet.php?product_id=34   

 

which would serve my needs very well, but it is a bit pricey, though I would
pay it if I had to.  My question is where else might I find 90 degree
gearboxes on-line.  

 

I will also need a universal joint for a small shaft, maybe 5/8" or 3/4".
Do any of you know of an on-line supplier for these, stainless steel
preferred.

 

Thanks,

Ken

The Mitrpak gearbox is an excellent one. The spiral bevel gears provide
very smooth action and the gearbox seals on the stainless shafts protect
the innards quite well in wet environments.

The Cadence uses the next size down, but with a small propeller and a
high shaft rpm it all works out.

Depending on your shaft misalignment and shaft support, you might consider
Love-Joy couplers instead of U-joints. Why do you need such a large shaft
diameter?

Thanks Michael,

Maybe I don't need such a large shaft.  I'm new to this which is why I bring
it up here.  Also, these boats won't be racers by any means.  Just pleasure
craft, though any efficiency is always desirable.

I will need to able to raise the prop maybe 15 degrees to be able to protect
it in shallow water. Will the Love-Joy couplings have that much flex?

I'm unsure what you mean by the Cadence.  Is this another gearbox from
Mitrpak or is it a boat.  I think what you are saying is that Mitrpak makes
a smaller gear box that is on the Cadence which is a boat, maybe your boat.
I see a smaller gearbox at Mitrpak with a 3/8ths shaft.  Is this what you
mean?  Also,  if the Cadence is a boat would you have a link to it?

Thanks for your time,
Ken

I expect the 0.5" shaft is the best.  You can use it with a 4:1  
ratio, which is reasonably easy to achieve with standard bike bits.

If you go on Ebay you can sometimes find low cost boxes that are  
quite good.  The Mitrpak is hard to beat though.

The universal joint will give you a jerky sensation on the pedals.   
One that will handle the torque will be quite large and contribute  
noticeable drag.  I have used one at higher rpm and it was OK.

The best set up I have found is a side mounted curved shaft.  I  
prefer a 8mm (5/16") spring steel for the shaft.  I paint them to  
reduce corrosion.  The best set up I have used is shown here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_Dec_2008.jpg
The latest arrangement has carbon fibre tubing for the frame.

You can see the curved shaft running down the side of the hull.  The  
shaft strut has 2 small stainless steel bearings purchased from  
"smallparts".  It is very smooth in operation.

The shaft can be pulled up while on the water for inspection for weed  
or running in shallow water because it is flexible.  The strut is set  
up to stop the prop from hitting the hull but it is pivoted at the  
top, allowing it to swing outward freely.

Finding spring steel in the form of straight round bar is not that  
easy but it is worth the effort.  It can be cut with a hacksaw but  
the blade will need to be replaced afterwards.  I use a grinder.  You  
can use 1/4" round bar but it will feel jerky at high power level.

Thanks Michael,

Maybe I don't need such a large shaft.  I'm new to this which is why  
I bring
it up here.  Also, these boats won't be racers by any means.  Just  
pleasure
craft, though any efficiency is always desirable.

I will need to able to raise the prop maybe 15 degrees to be able to  
protect
it in shallow water. Will the Love-Joy couplings have that much flex?

I'm unsure what you mean by the Cadence.  Is this another gearbox from
Mitrpak or is it a boat.  I think what you are saying is that Mitrpak  
makes
a smaller gear box that is on the Cadence which is a boat, maybe your  
boat.
I see a smaller gearbox at Mitrpak with a 3/8ths shaft.  Is this what  
you
mean?  Also,  if the Cadence is a boat would you have a link to it?

Thanks for your time,
Ken

Thanks for the links Rick.  The flex shaft is fascinating.  Not sure were
I'd find some spring steel shaft, but I'll look around.   

In the mean while I did figure out how else I could do this, and that is to
put the angle gearbox after, below, or on the swivel that the top end of the
drive shaft mounted to.  But this would point the propeller at a little bit
of a downward angle.  Not sure what that would do to the efficiency of the
prop.

The efficiency of the propeller correlates with the aspect of the  
blades.  Long thin blades will be more efficient than short fat  
ones.  Inevitably there is a compromise based on draft or blade  
strength.

Mounting an efficient propeller at a slight angle will reduce  
efficiency by a small amount.  However the blade loading becomes very  
unballanced.  At a shaft angle around 5 degrees the the downgoing  
blade will be thrusting with high force while the upgoing blade will  
be doing next to nothing.  This condition puts the shaft in high  
bending load and creates vibration.  Increasing the shaft angle  
beyond 5 degrees really starts to cause problems.

You will see powered propeller shafts at higher angles like 15  
degrees but these props have high slip and usually three or more  
blades so the vibration is not as bad.  They usually have efficiency  
between 50 to 60%.

If you have a propeller pushing on a shaft the shaft can be  
completely unsupported as the prop is strongly self stabilising.   
When the shaft is inclined you are fighting these forces.

It is worth the effort to get spring steel if you can.  Machinable  
grade aluminium also works but it needs to be about 10mm thick and a  
little longer as it cannot be curved as tight.

Thanks Again Rick, I will move on to propellers in a new thread soon.  For
now, I haven't been able to lay my hands on any 5/16ths spring steel, 1/4"
is all I could find, but the supplier had some "stressproof" steel that they
say is .40/.48 carbon, which I assume is a percentage.  Anyway it has pretty
good spring to it, and was cheap so I bought some that I will test later
today.

More later,
Ken

I have the book "Fluid-Dynamic Drag" by S. F. Hoerner that has a ton of
interesting information in it.  One of the charts shows induced drag for
trapezoidal wings with different ratios of root to tip cord.  I used this to
look at minimizing induced drag for a given amount of sail area and
overturning moment for a sail boat.  As I recall, for a given aspect ratio,
minimum induced drag comes with the tip cord at 1/3 of the base cord.
However, on a sailboat you are limited by stability, so induced drag vs
overturning moment is important, not induced drag vs aspect ratio.

What I found was that by increasing the sail cord at the base and reducing
it at the tip I could increase the aspect ratio of the sail and for the same
overturning moment the net induced drag dropped.

I would expect some similar effect for propellers, although significantly
more complicated.  In a propeller the aspect ratio is limited by material
properties.  If you increase the taper of the propeller the base of the
blade gets wider and thicker and so stronger and stiffer.  This might not be
the most efficient shape for a given aspect ratio, but it might let you run
significantly higher aspect ratio and I would expect the higher aspect ratio
to give a net benefit.

Unfortunately, you could make it more complicated still by including the
thickness ratio in the optimization.  For a given propeller design there is
an optimum thickness ratio, but using one thicker than optimum would give
more strength and stiffness and support a higher aspect ratio.  Even load
distribution could be optimized this way.  Increasing the loading at the
roots reduces the stress on the blade and allows a higher aspect ratio.

I wouldn't want to try to write the code to optimize all of the variables,
but it does seem some improvement could be made by changes that would
improve the  mechanical/strength efficiency of the design.

Good to see your adaptations to the flex shaft have worked so well in your hpb, Rick. I particularly like your side mount and ability to quickly clear weeds. Wonder if there are considerations because the thrust being parallel rather than in line with the hull.... 
 
In my much lower power electric applications I use a much shorter 4' shaft made of fiberglass tube graduated in two sections. No strut or rudder. This seems to give better pivoting steering control from the stiffer upper section while allowing just enough flexing from the lower section to allow the prop to go where it wants. I need the lowest weight possible in my application so am always looking for the the lightest shaft and prop possible. That way the whole unit can be lifted up to remove weeds or even hand held for propulsion in extremely shallow water. I have quick release hex connectors for the shaft and quick release adaptations on the prop so that both can be switched out in seconds. That way data can be quickly gathered for different motor and prop combinations. Should the shaft or prop be damaged or lost on an excursion, switching to spare ones carried on board only takes seconds.
 
Hope this is useful to anyone working with flex shafts.
 
Cheers.
 
Vic
