Subject: [hpv-boats] I need advice on selling my Yamaha Lakerunner
Message-ID: <4F85EDAD.7000501@sandsmachine.com>

Hi All

I have given up on pedaling in the recumbent position, bikes and boats, 
due to lower back pain which gets worse every time I try.

As a result, I plan to sell my Yamaha Lakerunner.

Does anyone have an idea what a Lakerunner, in good condition, is worth 
and also, where is a good place to advertise it?

I put it on craigslist but I suspect the audience may be too small to 
attract the right buyer.

Thank you in advance form a long time lurker.

Take care

Steve:

You know what you paid, but I would expect a huge bid - ask range on an item 
like this because of such a small following in the USA. Perhaps consignment 
at a shop that sells Hobie & other pedal types, or take to sell at a kinetic 
sculpture race in your state, Ventura or Eureka?

Mike Lampi has started posting some of his race clips to YouTube.

There are 4 clips for the Jetty Island race he did this month.

First shows him moving from dock:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dlCe2m_Bp0&feature=youtube_gdata

Next shows some warm up near the start:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uGCtH5TNo0&feature=youtube_gdata

Then the start - he is on the nearside of the course taking photos:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td5FOAUuk_E&feature=youtube_gdata

Then the finish - he comes in just before the 8 minute mark but  
camera has trouble focusing:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMEZFycXD4Y&feature=youtube_gdata

Ian Cassell has also started to post to YouTube:

       The link for my YouTube didn't work,
try this one.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8BaIr44zPg
Otherwise type in the search  V15-I_calm_Water.

As we are all seperated by distance or continents
this could be a good way of getting a look at
everyones boats, post a clip of their boat in or
out of the water.

The link line-wrapped in the email.  I did not check it after it posted.

Matt Johnson has quite a few on his V15-65 and his sailing/pedal cat  
here:

This one shows the stability while boarding from dock:

Fred Pluimers has posted a video clip of his Stand Up Paddleboard in  
operation:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDsH-970dwQ

The board is made by Hobie and the frame I supplied but was  
subsequently modified to better fit the board.  The comprises a DZ22  
gearbox, 1/4" spring steel shaft and prop with folding blades.

The board hits its wave hump between 7 and 8kph.  A pilot with good  
power to weight might be able to get it to plane.

The Aquaskipper looks pretty cool, but I can't imagine being in that bent over position for very long. If those guys have to assume that position, where would a 6'4" bear like myself be? 

But to scavenge parts from it and go from there, well, that would be sweet. 

What is the nature of the drive train and propeller. I did not see any pictures of the actual pedal foil mechanism.

Rowing Boat for big water.

Boat looks good, a scaled down version I think
could be easily fitted out as a pedal boat. Wonder
why the outriggers hang so far out the back?
