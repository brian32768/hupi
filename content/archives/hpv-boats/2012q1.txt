I completed a new boat in time for the Murray Marathon but family  
concerns prevented participation.

I have posted some pictures here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_58.htm

I have only had the boat out a few times and have already got it  
going faster than any other.  Top speed so far is 19kph and I expect  
I will get a bit more.

I am still battling to get weight below 20kg.  This one came out at  
21.5kg.  I will need to vacuum bag the hull to get lower.

Best wishes to all for 2012.

Happy new year to all.

Rick, is that a hand drill gearbox being used in V15 or something else you 
found? Looks a lot more compact and lightweight than some of your previous 
models.

Here is a reference to graphene, a very new possibly stronger and lighter 
material that I thought you might find interesting. It is already available 
in powder form and can aparently be tweaked for marine applications:
http://www.plastemart.com/Plastic-Technical-Article.asp?LiteratureID=1433&Paper=graphene-automotive-aerospace-wind%20energy-electronics

Might be a way for a lighter hull down the road a bit...

Cheers,

Vic

I have a couple of these boxes and have used them before.  They are  
designated DZ2.  They have similar rating to an R-082 Mitrpak box but  
have slightly thicker shaft.  They weigh 1kg.

With my present method of construction I have been adding more than  
1kg in fairing the hull.  If I were to vacuum bag over a male mould  
with a silicone bag I will get fairer finish.  It would save a lot of  
effort and reduce weight.

As it is the boat is quite easy to carry with stabilisers attached.   
They fold up over the seat once the brace is unclipped. This is how I  
transport the boat.

This boat now looks good enough such that some people actually ask  
"Where did I buy it?" rather than asking "Did you make it?".  So some  
progress on the finish but still not commercial quality.

There is a fellow who has seen Mike racing his V15 boat who has  
approached me about making a plastic version with a view to  
commercial production.  It is early days yet but will see how it  
progresses.

I have gone back to the side mounted prop for a variety of reasons.   
The instigator was a semi-professional cyclist, Matt Johnson, from  
Seattle who has built a V15 style hull 6.5m long with the original  
intention of bettering the 24 hour record.  I have since convinced  
Matt that he should join Mike in the Sound Rowers races.  Matt can  
sustain around 330W, which is around 3 times what I can hold and  
about twice what Mike can hold.  In looking at the drive train I  
found I could not come up with a suitable shaft design for aft  
mounted prop for this power level  so went back to the side mount  
design for him.  It prompted me to use that set up on the new boat  
and he can now copy what I have done.  I will probably supply a prop  
and maybe shaft.  Also Mike still gets a bit of bother clearing weed  
from his folding prop and that is simply not an issue with a prop you  
can reach by hand and clean if it is badly fouled.

The reason I can get higher speed from this boat is the low torsional  
compliance of the drive train.  I am spinning a lower pitch prop at  
7X cadence.  The prop is on an 8mm diameter spring steel shaft that  
is only 1.4m long.  The drive dynamics are much improved over my  
V15-6m boat with the aft mounted prop on the CF shaft.

The CF shaft with aft mounted prop has worked very well but it is so  
long and at 4X cadence spinning a high pitch prop the torsional  
compliance is noticeable above 14kph.  It eventually limits top speed  
due to shaft recoil at the crank deadspot.  Mike Lampi is limited to  
about 8mph due to his shaft dynamics so he cannot do the high speed  
sprint to the finish line he could do in the Cadence despite his V15  
boat being faster over the course.

I did a lot of drive analysis for a guy, Dave Giering, who eventually  
wound his own CF shaft.  He has a very heavy boat but is pleased with  
his new shaft.  So CF shafts are a good way to go but they need to be  
purpose made to have bending compliance but torsional stiffness.

Didn't you get a flurry of activity from Rick Willoughby recently?  I  
have not had my own keel wet in six years.  I realized that my boat  
work was probably not building a sustainable, useful technology, and  
lost interest.  HPBs appeal to simplicity, while metal and water  
demand complexity.  I'm still interested in the possibility of fin  
drives, made from carved wood and rope.  A high-tech version could be  
as fast as a propeller.

Hi Bob, Curt, All,

I'm still linked and receiving the rare contribution, but have been inactive for quite awhile myself.

At 71, diminishing years and energy have found me putting my boat-thoughts/efforts into somewhat larger sail/powered craft, but I'm still appreciative of the efforts of Rick and others who are pushing HPB envelopes.

I wish the main body of discussion had not so completely moved to other venues, but maybe the increased level of technology and required mathematical and computer literacy made that inevitable.

Part of the fun for me was leaning against a figurative tree watching the early "back-yard" inventors fumble forward. I've learned a lot, but improving my knowledge was a low bar, compared to  getting to the level of today's fore-fronters.

Bob, ever since Harry Bryan's first fin-drive showed up, the graceful swishing of a fin drive and the natural looking magic of a boat moving under "fish power" has intrigued me.

Slow moving/turning parts with surprising resulting movement are fascinating to me. (In my mind, I still carry the image of my first sight of Knapp's Sea Saber pulling smoothly away with its relatively slow-turning 18"(or so) prop.

I would like to see the result of extended, concerted efforts by such a community as used to exist on this site, directed toward a state-of-the-art fin set-up.

I used to think some split-fin arrangement might best answer the yaw issue, with the fins sweeping opposite directions at a given time (think swim fins on a diver swimming on his side).

I also imagined a forward turning rudder-fin actuated in phase with the (single) fin's stroke to "lift" the bow to the appropriate side to counter the fin's yaw force. Additional drag, of course, but a fixed forward fin also has drag, but offers less correcting "lift" due to restricted angle of attack, no?

Anyway, tossing ideas into the midst of this group has always been fun. :-)

Very nice to hear you are still out there Bob!  "High tech" wood and rope. I like it! 

Best wishes and Happy New Year to all,

Larry

Hello everyone(again!),

Just a quick note of apology for redundancy.

After typing my last, I visited some of the HPB archives here:
http://www.mail-archive.com/hpv-boats at bikelist.org/msg00434.html

...and found that almost all that I posted today was part of a previous discussion about a year ago.

I claim age related CRS as my excuse.

Fun to read the older back-and-forth anyway. ;-)

Leaping Lizards, Larry.

I'm not quite sure what you were describing, but suddenly I'm  
wondering about a fin that moves vertically, instead of having to  
react against another fin.  With the right linkage, the legs could  
tilt it for steering, or run it in short strokes for shallow draft.

A lot of fin drives use flex to accommodate changes in direction, but  
that usually gives the foil the opposite camber to what you want.   
Rigid fins on a hinge with limited motion are an improvement, like  
the symmetrical wing sections of an aerobatic aircraft.  However, it  
is possible to get beneficial camber by using spars fore and aft,  
with a flexible material in between.

Hi Bob,

Well, if we're talkin' mammal drive rather than fish drive, I suppose we've traded yaw issues for pitch issues ;-).

 I picture Parker McCready's Preposterous Pogofoil, and I imagine myself preferring the wake of the swishing back-and-forth tail, over the (turbulent?) commotion behind the up and downer.

I always find your input excellent thought food. Great to hear from you again!

Larry

Hey Bob and Larry,

 

That's better!  It's great to hear ideas being batted around again.
Some of us (I'm talking about myself here) never had much to add to the
group but that doesn't mean  we weren't interested in what the rest of
you creative guys were thinking and doing.  I hope it keeps going on.
And on.

That is a great looking boat with a very impressive performance. 
I am please to see that you have reverted back to the side drive bent shaft system. This type of drive, I feel is the most practical for launching and retrieving with out a trailer plus it can be serviced while still afloat.

Having spent considerable time now with both systems I agree the side  
mounted prop offers practical benefits and significant performance  
benefits over aft mounted.

Even the offset thrust can be managed very easily by a bit of  
tweaking.  There is also a less evident benefit if the prop is spun  
in the direction such that the prop torque offsets the weight of the  
gearbox.  The boat trims out nicely.

On the third time out I got over 20kph.  I am now close to being  
power constrained rather than limited by footspeed and shaft  
compliance.  The gear ratio is 1:7 enabling me to reduce prop pitch  
which lowers prop torque, hence the amount of wind-up in the shaft.    
The dynamics of this latest drive system will be hard to better.


Did you do any boat modifications before last summer?

Hi Rick

At the electric boat race, a photo was taken from the rear of my boat & I decided that the wake was excessive so modified the square stern to a point.  This greatly reduced the wake but did not appear to improve the speed which is what you had predicted.
Additionally I completed several tests on propeller tip shapes & concluded that a simple HOEANER tip was a improvement over the radius ends that you have been using, additionally it is very simple to make.
The tips were raked outwards at 30 degrees with a radius where the leading edge meets the tip.
I also tried tiplets (look similar to winglets) & found the performance similar to the rake tips but as these were tried on fully shaped propeller blades I dropped the idea due to the high amount of work required.

Subject: [hpv-boats] Carbon Fibre Blades for Folding Propeller
Message-ID: <CE97357F-168B-4A37-9CC7-DE1B5D83E3B3@bigpond.net.au>

I now have a mould for making CF folding blades:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/CF_Prop_Blades.jpg

The resulting propeller has a diameter of 330mm and weighs 160g.  I  
have tested the blades to 16kph, which corresponds to 65N thrust.   
This is more than twice the thrust needed to achieve 12kph, which is  
the sustainable speed for a pilot in good shape.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONk3fUnHamI

The pitch was close to what I calculated below 12kph but it is  
possible there is some blade flexing due to loading because the pitch  
was apparently reducing as I increased speed.  Usually the speed to  
cadence increases as speed increases due to reduced slip.

The prop is suited to a gear ratio of between 6 to 8 depending on the  
boat and pilot although the boat needs to be easily driven.  I was  
running at 7X.

I could get 5kph in reverse spinning flat out.

The blades do not deploy as quickly as heavier blades.  I plan to use  
a stainless steel core to add some more weight and possibly reduce  
blade flexing.

Overall I am pleased at how the blades worked out.  It only takes a  
few minutes to lay up the blades but overnight to cure.  Hub is the  
same nylon rod I have used for stainless folding props for the last  
couple of years.

I plan to do durability testing over the next few months.

       How much of a weight difference is there
between the CF blades and steel ones?
Do you provide a slot in the hub for the shaft
or do you leave it blank. Being a nylon hub
it wouldn't be hard to drill.

The normal stainless blades weigh 70g.  Remember this is quite a  
small prop.  The CF blades currently have an aluminium core and weigh  
20g.  The core is needed for twist strength as I am only using  
unidirectional fibre lengthwise on the blade to resist bending.

The next ones I mould will have a stainless steel strip for the  
core.   This will add a bit of weight and should help deployment as  
well as stiffness against twisting.

There is much less effort in making these blades compared with  
grinding stainless steel.

I was surprised how easy it is to get a perfect blade from the  
mould.  The mould cost a bit but it is well made and virtually  
guarantees a good result.  The mould maker had not used CF for  
reinforcing before so it was an experiment for him as well.  He has  
made a mould for a larger fibreglass prop used for wind turbine and  
thousands of others moulds but mine is tiny by comparison with these.

Great looking prop, thanks for posting.

Have you reached perfection with this prop, so it can be used with your

can go to mass production, perhaps others would be interested in a 
purchase....

This prop is close to optimum for the side-mounted configuration on  
the V15 boat or any similar easily driven boat.   It suits a gear  
ratio around 7X .  It could be used on slightly heavier boats as well.

I have already supplied a prop to another boat and prepared to make  
them for sale if they suit the application subject to them  
demonstrating the required durability.

The last few seconds of the video has some detail on the boat - it is  
an OC1 with two outriggers rather than 1.  This has the advantage  
that the boat is balanced so the outriggers can be unloaded and just  
surface skim.  A normal OC1 will give away about 3 minutes in an hour  
compared with this configuration.

OC1 hulls are a little narrower than surfski because they do not need  
inherent stability in the one hull.  However a normal OC1 is slower  
than a surfski due to greater windage and the extra drag from the  
loaded outrigger.

Clive has now fitted a Bolly boat prop. The original  was a lower  
pitch model aircraft prop.

There are photos of the original set up here:
http://www.humanpoweredboats.com/Photos/Individuals/PedalWaa/ 
PedalWaa.htm

Until recently I thought the Pedal Wa'a and Harry Howard's Pedalos  
were the same boat but Clive explains that the drive was supplied by  
Harry Howard.  On inspection the cockpit of Pedalos is quite different:

Tom,
sorry, here's that link
http://youtu.be/Rdph3VOyPbU

Rick,
thanks for that info!
I'm a bit confused about the Harry Howard's Pedalos, his test mule,
and then the catamaran that went from NY to Brazil (I think).  And why
his record braking boat hasn't been offered to the general public but
the plastic boat is.

The pedalwaa has an interesting drive for the prop, but I'm not sure
if that method is for me.   I still like what you got going on the
best so far, at least for my boat's design.

And not to get too far off topic, but I've also been looking more into
the proas and what you said in your emails.  Richard Woods suggested
using a kayak for the outrigger hull which is very interesting so now
I'm trying to come up with a way of adapting a pedal prop drive to the
proa.  Main hull or outrigger/kayak hull?

Yeah, I know, I got two different boat designs going on at the same
time now.  I like how both are going, and yeah both are different and
so I see myself pretty busy with both of them!

for those just tuning in, I got a folding biplane rigged catamarn for
one design that I've been working on for awhile now, but recently have
go fascinated with proas, both boats are being designed to complete
the 1200 mile Ultimate Florida Challenge (which is presently in
progress with only 5 boats left and one about to drop out.)

After years of messing about in pedal kayaks, I decided that what I  
really wanted was a much narrower main hull with one outrigger.  That  
gave less wetted area, and having the drive leg beside the main hull  
made it easy to swing up for beaching or weed removal, etc.  while  
also keeping the drag and thrust lines close together.  The ama gave  
the option of carrying a passenger without ruining the trim, camping  
on the tramp, or sailing, with water ballast on one tack.  The open  
cockpit is self-bailing except for the footwell, which can have a  
speed bailer.  I have the hulls for this built, 20' and 12' long, and  
most of the hardware for a SpinFin with S cranks on one side, but  
have no time to finish it now.  Interested?

Subject: [hpv-boats] Matt Johnson First Test of his V15-65
Message-ID: <2B8EFA5A-2327-4C19-AF53-8873BF2BE72A@bigpond.net.au>

Matt Johnson contacted me in August 2011 regarding a pedal boat  
design suited to his weight and power output.  He finally got it on  
the water today and posted this video:
http://youtu.be/IL5GBgJbS_4
Matt is the most powerful engine I have done a design for to date so  
it will be interesting to follow progress.  He is aiming to join Mike  
Lampi in the Sound Rowers races when his time permits.

The resulting hull design is based on my V15 series but optimised for  
110kg displacement and 300W power.  Hull ended up 6.5m long.  Matt  
chose skin on frame as his method of construction along with a  
separate tubular frame and commercial recumbent seat that mounts to  
the basic boat.  The drive is configured with side-mounted curved  
shaft spinning at 7X cadence.

I provided a hub for folding prop and the second set of moulded CF  
blades for testing.

The test was impressive but brief because the folding CF blades  
snapped when he accelerated for the second run.

That boat of Matt's really flys, he really
accelerated away fast. Wonder what
speed he got up to. When he has used
it a few times he should be ready to set
a few records. The rudder caused a bit
of turbulence but that is a minor problem.
Hope his boat can stand up to the power
he can put into it.

He pushed up over 13kph easily but said he realised he has some  
conditioning to work on by the time he got to the other side of the  
lake.  The design speed is 4m/s or 14.4kph.  He should get to that  
with 270W .  When he was bike racing he was working in the high  
300s.  No doubt it will be interesting to follow progress.

I suggested he nurse the blades by staying below 16kph until he had  
worked out what needed changing or setting up better.  I forget to  
tell him not to accelerate hard.  Blades broke the second time he  
took off to do a pass for the camera.  I have tested the new blades  
to static load of 120N, which is 50% higher than I was prepared to  
take the first set.  New layup should be able to take my full power  
so will do some flat out sprints with my next set.

Matt will fabricate a set of stainless blades while he is waiting for  
my improved CF set.  It would be a shame if the blade strength  
limited his acceleration.

I went out with Ian C yesterday to do some filming of his new boat at  
launch.  It was windy with average of 25kts and gusts to 35kts so  
filming from my boat was bouncy.  The results are posted on Youtube:

Ian made some slight changes to the design and is using the in-line  
shaft arrangement with his 1:3.3 Involute made box with curved shaft  
all used on previous boat. The boat performed well and he was pleased  
with the way the wave piercing foredeck worked.
