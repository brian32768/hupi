<PRE>Bob
I am a reluctant Facebook user.  Also am a regular user of Google so gets heaps of targeted advertising.  New Australian laws will require ISPs to maintain all connection records for at least two years.  Big brother is here.

So here are the photos on my web site.

Greg's modified CP2; now heavier but stronger:

This is Scott Reeves' Third Wheel on the water:
<A HREF="http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Third_Wheel_on_water.jpg">http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Third_Wheel_on_water.jpg</A>
This is it on transport to get a better idea what 9m looks like:
<A HREF="http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Third_Wheel_on_Car.jpg">http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Third_Wheel_on_Car.jpg</A>

Third Wheel is 9m long with design displacement of 320kg.  It has three seats one is for rest and recovery.  Aim is to have two working engines in reasonable condition for the entire 340 miles.

Both drives on Third Wheel use a T10 industrial toothed belt inside a crank mast with the gearbox offset from that.  This is a view inside the mast:
<A HREF="http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/T10_Belt.jpg">http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/T10_Belt.jpg</A>
This arrangement has significant advantage over a chain or belt cantilevered from the overhanging shaft.  With the pulleys mounted between the bearings the shaft flex does not cause misalignment.   The nip point roller you see allows the belt to run without pre-tension.  Really smooth, low maintenance, quiet, belt enclosed and clean.

Andreas Husi also recently launched his converted rowing shell.  It has the same crank mast design.  This was taken after it was painted up:

This one was the first water test:

About a two month ago Fred Pluimers launched his V16-65 round chine boat.  The main hull is in three parts for easy transport and storing with a 3.2m long centre section and two end sections:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOKZDAkEac">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOKZDAkEac</A>
Fred is still using the drive design similar to what I had on the V7 boat that he purchased some years ago now.
