<PRE>Terrific overview, Bob, ... thanks for taking the time!

Plenty of food for thought.

As a side observation (OT), your reference to &quot;sea conditions&quot; brought 
to mind a similar issue with one of my FrontRower rigs, where the 
changing freeboard with lighter/heavier loadings, and the varying 
surface height with chop, dictated differering &quot;settings&quot; of the 
mechanism, to insure proper oar-blade immersion. ( I built an 
adjustment feature which helps with the freeboard issue, ...somewhat 
less helpful with chop, but helps a bit.)

Your idea re. multihull yaw resistance interests me. Considering the 
added advantage of inherent stability(no outrigger drag at any speed or 
degree of list), and the overall desirability of a single fin's 
simplicity, do you believe that the lateral resistance of two hulls 
would effectively reduce the overall drag, yaw plus hulls, enough to 
equal-or-better that of a monohull with yaw-countering and stabilizing 
appendages? I envision hulls each optimized for its half of the total 
displacement at expected speeds, and an overall beam dictated by 
Godzilla(etc.) for minimum intra-hull wave interference.) My weight 
hovers around 200 pounds these days, so I generally think in terms of 
about 325-350 for all-up weight of a &quot;pleasure&quot; craft with lunch, 
camera, etc.)

I took pleasure in watching the relatively slow-turning 18&quot; prop as Jon 
Knapp's Sea Saber moved away from the dock, which of course the rider 
could not see. There seemed to be a somewhat magical amount of forward 
motion from the prop activity.  I had a similar impression while 
watching the (8 ft.?) air prop on the (Steve Ball's?)Dragonfly 
hovercraft at (14-15mph? IHPVA Championships - Visalia Ca.) speed. I 
imagine similar pleasure from watching the fin working between the cat 
hulls, in this case perhaps visible to the rider, in a configuration 
which placed the fin closer beneath the pedals, minimizing linkages, 
etc.

Maybe a &quot;Feathercraft&quot; type kayak  drop-rudder(s) to assist turns, but 
raised for straight runs, minimizing appendage drag?

Jimbo,
Could you link-to or reference the source from which you took the quote 
re. Hobie efficiency? (i.e., the &quot;definitive study&quot;)
Thanks.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the data on the Hobie drive.  I wouldn't have bothered

</I>&gt;<i> improvement in all previous systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Starting from the fin, the usual scheme has been a rigid leading edge, 
</I>&gt;<i> with a flexible wing.  This gives a shape like an airplane wing flying 
</I>&gt;<i> upside down.  The first level of improvement is a rigid, symmetrical 
</I>&gt;<i> foil, as on an aerobatic aircraft, with a pivot that lets it 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically flip over to the best angle of attack for each stroke.  
</I>&gt;<i> This pivot can have a second degree of freedom under manual control 
</I>&gt;<i> that lets it be set for reverse thrust.  For greater  efficiency, we 
</I>&gt;<i> can use two wing spars, fore and aft, so that a flexible fin assumes 
</I>&gt;<i> nearly the ideal camber for each direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next, the fins should be placed so that there is no yaw imposed on the 
</I>&gt;<i> boat.  The Hobie is fine in this respect, whereas Harry Bryan's boat 
</I>&gt;<i> was getting thrust from all three fins as it wiggled through the 
</I>&gt;<i> water.  Two fins off the stern with opposite motions are one solution, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I prefer having a compact arrangement, with the fins nearer the 
</I>&gt;<i> pedals.  Three options are: a single fin, with the side  force reacted 
</I>&gt;<i> against the mass and shapes of a multihull, two opposed fins mounted 
</I>&gt;<i> like bilge keels or leeboards, or fins on the tips of sweeps, like 
</I>&gt;<i> oars on their way to being parked on the gunwales.
</I>&gt;<i> The single fin can be mechanically simple, with force in each 
</I>&gt;<i> direction coming from one pedal.  The bilge-keel mounting emulates the 
</I>&gt;<i> pectoral fins of whales and penguins, and avoids disturbing the 
</I>&gt;<i> surface of the water.  The leeboard style avoids a through-hull 
</I>&gt;<i> fitting and gives a longer sweep, but makes waves of it's own.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> might achieve a constructive interference with the hull, giving a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> of jet propulsion and suction at the hull end of the stroke.  Only the 
</I>&gt;<i> sweep mounting gives a really decent angle of attack, applying most of 
</I>&gt;<i> its force in the proper direction.  My propeller tips could move over 
</I>&gt;<i> 15' per pedal stroke (half rotation of cranks.)  However, sweeps need 
</I>&gt;<i> compliance and surface-followers to keep the fin working properly on 
</I>&gt;<i> most boats and sea conditions, and rigid parts to minimize hysteresis  
</I>&gt;<i> losses.  They probably need an extra link to maintain a parallelogram 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep the fin angle accurate.  They might also want a 
</I>&gt;<i> compact-operation mode for use within a marina where oars are a 
</I>&gt;<i> clearance problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The single-fin type requires a separate rudder, but the others are 
</I>&gt;<i> able to handle steering duties.  The leeboard style would allow course 
</I>&gt;<i> corrections, or errors, depending on the listing of a single hull.  
</I>&gt;<i> The double fin types, with reversing switches, would allow the boat to 
</I>&gt;<i> turn with no forward motion.  Various degrees of adjustment could be 
</I>&gt;<i> applied for course keeping, saving the drag of a rudder.  Ideally, 
</I>&gt;<i> steering could be done by either varying the force on each leg, or, 
</I>&gt;<i> preferably, by touching the reversing switch or trim adjustment with 
</I>&gt;<i> the sides of the heels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In shallow water, the fins could drag on the ground and still work, 
</I>&gt;<i> and when surfing onto a beach, they would dig in and resist the 
</I>&gt;<i> retreating wave.  They could also just swing back to shed weed if any 
</I>&gt;<i> drag built up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One great advantage of pedal cranks is that they conserve momentum.  
</I>&gt;<i> Linear drives often waste energy by requiring muscle power for 
</I>&gt;<i> deceleration, like shadow boxing.  I have not tried it yet, but a 
</I>&gt;<i> system like the Hobie drive, but with the pivot at the top might work 
</I>&gt;<i> well, like a pendulum.  If the natural frequency works out to the 
</I>&gt;<i> right range, it could be a sweet deal, combining easily with the sweep 
</I>&gt;<i> or leeboard schemes for a neat, drop-in installation.  The mass of the 
</I>&gt;<i> whole system would affect the frequency.  It could probably benefit 
</I>&gt;<i> from springs for adjustment to different speeds or leg weights.
