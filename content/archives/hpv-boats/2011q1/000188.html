I had not realised you had built new stabilisers.

When you get back on the water I would be interested in seeing some  
video of your boat in operation.

There is some potential for aft-down trim to add noticeable drag.   
There would be considerable turbulence associated with the sort of  
energy you are losing and a video will help identify where the  
problem is.

If the stabilisders are no longer dragging then your proposal to  
shift weight forward to lift the stern is a good option for next trial.

The tools are there to optimise your hull shape for minimum drag and  
this will be a much faster method of arriving at the best hull than  
endless trial and error.

Sorry , but I must have confused you slightly, the boat was fitted  
with narrow flat bottomed stabilisers for
the last few tests. These were mounted about 30 mm clear of the water  
surface and parallel to the boat bottom
.
I still suspect the 185 mm wide square stern and have been thinking  
of raising this up by moving the my seat and
drive system 75 mm forward. which intern would lower the front slightly.
