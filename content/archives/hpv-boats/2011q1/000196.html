<PRE>Thanks for the film clip, great concept. I use these guys who have a large 
selection of neodymium magnets to grade 52 <A HREF="http://www.kjmagnetics.com/">http://www.kjmagnetics.com/</A>  Some 
of their smaller magnets are very lightweight and low cost and so strong 
they can't be pulled apart. Plating may be a little thin for your type of 
project, though.

&gt;<i>I have been playing around with the idea of making a magnetic right  angle 
</I>&gt;<i>drive unit for a while.  Over the past few months I invested in  some 
</I>&gt;<i>magnets and built a prototype:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCuCmzcjpao">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCuCmzcjpao</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The video shows the torque test.  I have a 5kg weight suspended on a 
</I>&gt;<i> lever arm connected to the output shaft.  The lever gets out to 230mm 
</I>&gt;<i> before the magnets let go. This particular variant has a ratio of  1:3.3 
</I>&gt;<i> and gives in at 11Nm on the output shaft.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The torque at this ratio is ample for cruising to speed of up to  12.5kph 
</I>&gt;<i> but would give out in a sprint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The unit was not executed to the initial design because I could not  get 
</I>&gt;<i> the quantity of magnets of the particular size I wanted.  It was  intended 
</I>&gt;<i> as a 1:5 step up but I could not get the alignment right  with only 4 
</I>&gt;<i> magnets on the output so went up to 6 thus reducing the  ratio.  However I 
</I>&gt;<i> got better than a commensurate increase in torque.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This unit is extremely robust and heavier than I would want in a  boat. 
</I>&gt;<i> One feature is that the weight is distributed at a large  radius so the 
</I>&gt;<i> crank and output both have high rotational inertia -  flywheels if you 
</I>&gt;<i> like.  This leads to smoother pedaling and can  compensate a little for a 
</I>&gt;<i> torsionally compliant prop shaft.   Another  feature is the load limiting 
</I>&gt;<i> on the prop shaft.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I made it to tighter tolerance I could get higher torque.  In a  way 
</I>&gt;<i> this would defeat the original idea because I was exploring the  concept 
</I>&gt;<i> for ease of building without need for precision machining.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expect with ideal magnet selection and simple method of  construction 
</I>&gt;<i> this arrangement could be built for under AUD200.
</I>&gt;<i>
