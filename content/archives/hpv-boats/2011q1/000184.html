<PRE>This commercial product is not a flex shaft, but is available for those 
inquires looking for a drive system. <A HREF="http://www.prophish.com/pedalboats.html">http://www.prophish.com/pedalboats.html</A> 
It appears to be a rugged (Jose's adventure NY-Rio), somewhat adaptable unit 
with built in steering and easy lift and lower. Don't know the drive ratio, 
but possibly adaptable to a version of Rick's prop which would improve 
efficiency.

Hope this helps.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Rick, Mark and all
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there is 'enough interest' both for the propeller and a complete
</I>&gt;<i> flex shaft propulsion system.
</I>&gt;<i> This opinion comes from the sustained growth of the Open Waterbike 
</I>&gt;<i> Project:
</I>&gt;<i> the community is still tiny (just over ten thousand unique vistors, just a
</I>&gt;<i> few hundreds members)  but autonomously growing nothwhitstanding our very
</I>&gt;<i> limited resources. We have requests from individuals and firms, coming in
</I>&gt;<i> from countries as different as Brasil, Turkey, India (but now the
</I>&gt;<i> baricenter has shifted from Europe to the US). Most people and perspective
</I>&gt;<i> dealers and manufacturers are intersted in buying the drive system, while 
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> seems appealing to most is the possibility of building locally  hulls and
</I>&gt;<i> other less critical and cumbersome parts, and they seek technical support
</I>&gt;<i> for that.
</I>&gt;<i> I reckon the availability of a complete high performance drive system will
</I>&gt;<i> be the turning point: maybe the dream of an 'Open' high performance pedal
</I>&gt;<i> boat has a real possibility of becoming reality after all..m.
