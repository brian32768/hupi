I left the lake around midday Saturday - a pity I did not see you.

I thought your outriggers were reasonably well adjusted previously.   
You want them positioned so you your are stable when moving.  This  
will mean a little flop roll at rest.

The 16mm shaft is 3X stiffer torsionally than the 12mm and improves  
RMS to average power input substantially.  You could still get a  
curved shaft of similar torsional stiffness by combining the 16mm  
aluminium through the hull with 8mm spring steel below the hull.  The  
length of steel just enough to give the curve. I can help with the  
join.  This is what I ended up doing on V15.

I did a couple of full length runs of the lake now that it is near  
full height but weed was a nuisance.  The folding prop sheds it OK  
but it means regularly coasting to fold the blades.

You need to get a GPS so you can get some measured data.   Maybe next  
weekend we can have good weather and be somewhere at the same time.

How bad is the prop vibration?
