<PRE>Hello Jimbo,

Boating in internet waters is fraught with the icebergs of 
misunderstandings, misperceptions, and misinterpretations. To attempt 
to dodge a few of these mis'es, let me state that my own interest in 
the fin drive discussion is almost completely curiosity-driven 
(sometimes a very inefficient drive-system itself ;-). I have no 
&quot;dog-in-the-fight&quot;, particularly not the Mirage system, which has never 
appealed to me. Hobie or not, I don't accept that their drive is the 
be-all, end-all of fin systems. Of the systems I am aware of, only the 
Harry Bryan fin I mentioned caught my fancy at all, and I considered 
the yaw issue the greatest drawback, which was an entirely subjective 
objection on my part. It seemed to be a fly in the soup of what was 
otherwise the simple fish tail on-a-boat concept that intrigued me. 
Thus my question about a possibly yaw-balancing &quot;split-fin drive&quot;  ( no 
comments yet on this).

As regards the Bryan fin-system, specifically, I would submit that it 
is hardly more complex or subject to breakage than a prop system. (IF 
comparing them was the topic - see next to last sentence below)

As  tongue-in-cheek observation, I note that the Hobie effort , while 
solving the yaw issue, seems to me a fish trying to swim with its 
ventral fins as the main propulsors, rather than the tail. Other fish, 
smarter, I think, have chosen the tail as a better way to go.

I have watched Parker McReady on his Preposterous Pogofoil,  one of the 
earliest whale-tail creations and the horizontal fluke drive, at least 
in his hydrofoiling configuration,  was definitely a high-effort 
short-term proposition. Nothing relaxed about it.  Same goes for 
similar-but-simpler hydrofoil jumping-jack drive craft recently 
marketed (name escapes me at the moment.) Any horizontal fin &quot;fluke&quot; 
drive, introduces &quot;vertical yaw&quot;(pitching) which hurts efficiency also, 
of course.

Harry Bryan's simple displacement hull with a swish-tail fin flexing 
gracefully behind the boat much better suits my fantasy concept of a 
fin-craft for easy-does-it messing about. (Another marketing attempt, 
the Pacific Tail-fin, seems to have stalled, - the latest web-site 
update is dated 2006, I think. This is the &quot;more bulky&quot; unit I first 
mentioned, when compared with Harry's rig. Yaw is also evident in the 
site's videos.)

For elegant simplicity in a prop drive, Bob Stuart's drop-in Spin-Fin, 
which I have tried in his own kayak, very much impressed me, and if 
production/marketing considerations had been favorable enough that Bob 
had chosen to continue pursuing its development, I believe it would 
have become very popular. (More so than the larger Sea-Cycle units, 
IMO.)

(Relatively) recent progress in design and experimentation with 
flex-shaft propellor units, as exemplified by Rick's successes, with 
some collaboration by one or more others, I believe,  seem to me to 
represent the state of the prop-drive art at present, along with the 
interesting recent attempts at hp folding props. I also think the 
&quot;kissing outrigger&quot; stabilized monohull, again highly developed by 
Rick, Bob and others, has been adequately demonstrated to be the way to 
go for displacement speed.

In any case, I make no case for a fin's efficiency compared with a 
prop. Apples and oranges, I believe.  The trophy for ultimate speed, 
which I suppose is the highest measure of hp &quot;efficiency&quot; as we seem to 
be measuring things, seems still to be held by an air-prop driven 
hydrofoil (Decavitator) unless I am too far behind the times.

But the maximum-speed efficiency machines are not what I, at 70, am 
interested in spending my time on. Thus my intent in pursuing &quot;fin 
discussion&quot; is not to compare/compete with prop drives, but to explore 
fins as a separate subject.

I am slowing down, but still enjoy reading about and watching the 
experiments and progress achieved by all the human-power group, 
whatever their goals.  So I add my encouragements to all, whatever 
envelope they may be pushing. ;-)

Best wishes,

Larry

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Bob,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm confident that  Rick is right on top of propellor-stuff, but I'd 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to hear more about your fin-drive ideas.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Max efficiency is less of an issue when &quot;messing about &quot; is the goal, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and freedom from weed-wrapped props with the convenience of a kick-up 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drive, combined with the fish-like grace of a flexible fin appeals to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wouldn't mind resorting to a paddle for the occasional reverse 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I liked the relative simplicity of Harry Bryan's rig, as opposed to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the bulkier drive that was later developed and discussed for awhile 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on this list. Seems I remember some sort of transparent flex fin on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Harry's early experiment. I like the esthetics. ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Harry ultimately used a forward fin(skeg) to counter yaw effects, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...I was wondering if you had any other ideas on yaw control.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was wondering whether a split fin with stacked halves in opposed 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> motion would be feasible, or would turbulence between the flow 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between the fin-halves interfere too much to be useful? (Picture a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> swim-finned diver swimming on his side)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would value any comments you might make (Others' opinions welcome 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Larry (Bob, I'm not sure if we have communicated via e-mail since 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your move(s?). [ My e-address is <A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv-boats">lhsmith at wvi.com</A> ]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I used to make pedal-propeller drive units.  They were quite 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> successful, but perfection as a product became quite expensive.  One 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> peculiarity of human power is the fluctuating torque, so that most 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the time, the propeller is operating far from its most efficient 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rate. The fin-based drive on the Hobie Mirage has to reverse 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> direction at the end of each stroke, but this probably involves less 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> friction than keeping a propeller moving at a constant speed.  If I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were building another boat now, I would use some kind of fin drive, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and try to design the basic unit so that it could be built and 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> maintained wherever wooden boats are made, without any purchased 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hardware.  I have sketched out several possibilities of varying 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> complexity, size, and efficiency.  I expect that they would be as 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fast as propeller drives, and better around shallows and weeds.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
