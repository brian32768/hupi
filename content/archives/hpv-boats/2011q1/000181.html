&gt;<i> What this really shows is that there can be no hard and fast rules as the 
</I>&gt;<i> prop must be tuned to the application ie the boat.
</I>&gt;<i> I like you feel that a 4 to 1 gear ratio is about right, bur like Bob 
</I>&gt;<i> Stuart I also feel that  if the pitch and dia are equal the prop is more 
</I>&gt;<i> flexible
</I>&gt;<i> and even though the revs would be higher the efficiency might be better. 
</I>&gt;<i> To sum it up regardless of the prop design programmes, prop design it 
</I>&gt;<i> still very trial and error

Dennis, I think the statements above are a good summary.  I would approach 
it by defining the end goal first and consider the motor you have to work 
with, then work backwards. Prioritize the main goal whether it is sprinting, 
endurance, draft, weight,  durability, etc. Computer design programs can be 
helpful but tweaking through dynamic testing can be used for further 
improvement.  I think
Rick does that on some level, otherwise why all the different creations? His 
sister's boat uses a limited range folder and perhaps has other changes 
compared to his own...
