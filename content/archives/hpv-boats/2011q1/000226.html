<PRE>Mark,

Marco Polo Boats has both a Mitrpak right angle gear box at a 1:2 increaser ratio made specifically for HPB, as well as a very flexible cable shaft that can bend 90 degrees over its length. Photos of the Mitrpak are on our website, and write if you would like photos of the cable shaft.

In addition, we are working on a redesign of our PlanetDrive with a 1:4 increaser ratio and 300 in-lbs of torque rating. The PlanetDrive will now be directly attached to Mitrpak drive for a total of 1:8 increaser ratio.

Rick Willoughby has tried the flex cable drive, and found it fine until 11 kph, at which point it kicks back, but we are working on a solution to that. The cable shafts are not yet on the website (marcopoloboats.com), but they are 316 Stainless Steel and two meters long. The cost is $225 delivered in the U.S. Figure about another $50 for delivery outside of the U.S.

We will be working on website updates this week, but if you want more information, please contact us directly.

Thanks,

Mark Vermilion
Marco Polo Boats, Inc.
