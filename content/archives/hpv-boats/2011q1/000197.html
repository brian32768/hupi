<PRE>If that 71 degrees is off the horizontal, seems like a long, untethered flex 
shaft could be used to correct, since it always remain at the optimum. I 
don't know the configuration of your boat, so you may have already 
considered and rejected due to your arrangement. When Greg K set his 24 hour 
distance record with an untethered shaft, it only amounted to about a 2% 
improvement compared to a skeg and inclined rigid shaft, but I don't know if 
the angle of inclination was ever as great as 71 degrees...

Hope this helps.

</I>&gt;<i>       When I first used the 16mm rigid shaft it vibrated
</I>&gt;<i> a bit but its something I don't notice now. Inside the 16mm
</I>&gt;<i> aluminium tube I have a wooden rod glued into place.
</I>&gt;<i> I kept coating the rod with an expanding glue as I
</I>&gt;<i> pushed it into the tube. This makes the shaft more rigid
</I>&gt;<i> as well as a bit stiffer torsionally.
</I>&gt;<i>        With the 16mm shaft angle I am thinking of making
</I>&gt;<i> another prop with a different pitch. For example the prop
</I>&gt;<i> at one point is angled at 55 deg but with the 16 deg shaft
</I>&gt;<i> angle the actual angle is 71 deg. The prop is only at
</I>&gt;<i> optimum in the horizontal and looses in the vertical. If
</I>&gt;<i> I made a 4 blade prop with a different pitch to suit the
</I>&gt;<i> shaft angle there would be more prop at optimum thrust.
</I>&gt;<i> I might be way out here but it would be interesting to see
</I>&gt;<i> how such a prop would work.
</I>&gt;<i>        Where I often go at the rowing course and the river
</I>&gt;<i> weed is not a problem, just bump into a jellyfish now
</I>&gt;<i> and then.
</I>&gt;<i>         Had a lot of expenses of late so the GPS has
</I>&gt;<i> been put on the backburner. Have to do timed runs at
</I>&gt;<i> the rowing course.
