<PRE>Rick
       When I first used the 16mm rigid shaft it vibrated 
a bit but its something I don't notice now. Inside the 16mm
aluminium tube I have a wooden rod glued into place.
I kept coating the rod with an expanding glue as I 
pushed it into the tube. This makes the shaft more rigid 
as well as a bit stiffer torsionally.
        With the 16mm shaft angle I am thinking of making
another prop with a different pitch. For example the prop
at one point is angled at 55 deg but with the 16 deg shaft
angle the actual angle is 71 deg. The prop is only at
optimum in the horizontal and looses in the vertical. If
I made a 4 blade prop with a different pitch to suit the
shaft angle there would be more prop at optimum thrust.
I might be way out here but it would be interesting to see
how such a prop would work.
        Where I often go at the rowing course and the river 
weed is not a problem, just bump into a jellyfish now
and then.
         Had a lot of expenses of late so the GPS has 
been put on the backburner. Have to do timed runs at 
the rowing course.
