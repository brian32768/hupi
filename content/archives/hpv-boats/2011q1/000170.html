<PRE>I think the advice on a step up of 1:5 or less only pertains to a  
situation where the fluctuating torque of a single rider is used.  It  
reduces the loss during the low-power parts of the cycle.  The high  
pitch is a compromise, pushing water around as much as back.   
Usually, the best efficiency is found when the pitch and diameter are  
nearly the same, leading to a step-up of around 1:10 for a tandem  
with the pedals out of phase.

</I>&gt;<i> for a variety of reasons. One less obvious problem is the induced  
</I>&gt;<i> roll due to the higher torque.  It also has a greater tendency to  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;walk&quot; sideways than a higher speed prop.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 5 to be near optimum for an easily driven boat.  Your 1:3.3 is not  
</I>&gt;<i> far off optimum - way better than 1:2.  You only problem is getting

</I>&gt;<i> The height of the seat on V15 is not much different to V14.  The  
</I>&gt;<i> step in the deckline gives the impression of the seat being higher.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The low deck at the cranks means the seating can be more upright,  
</I>&gt;<i> which is something my sister wanted.  I prefer being more reclined  
</I>&gt;<i> but like the low deck at the crank to keep the feet lower.  Helps  
</I>&gt;<i> with blood flow to the feet.  Once moving there is little tendency  
</I>&gt;<i> for water to wash onto the lower deck in waves because the  
</I>&gt;<i> divergent wave from the bow forms a trough along the side of the  
</I>&gt;<i> hull. This will be less so with a 6m long hull because the  
</I>&gt;<i> divergent waves are smaller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have continued to play with the V15 design mainly to simplify  
</I>&gt;<i> construction and improve load paths for strength.  There are a few  
</I>&gt;<i> people building various alternatives of this design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would not recommend the extended fairing behind the seat.  It  
</I>&gt;<i> does reduce frontal windage but this can be achieved with a shorter  
</I>&gt;<i> tail-box.  It increases the roll force when side on to wind.  With  
</I>&gt;<i> wind on the bow quarter there is a noticeable tendency to sail but  
</I>&gt;<i> this has limited application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The V15 design has a distinct advantage over V14 when pushing into  
</I>&gt;<i> wind and waves.  There is no tendency for water to wash back over  
</I>&gt;<i> the bow when it buries and the reduced windage is significant in  
</I>&gt;<i> even slight wind.  It also surfs better because the bow does not  
</I>&gt;<i> dive and it does not flop roll with the outriggers set aft.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The flat rocker increases the turning circle over V14 and this  
</I>&gt;<i> requires making allowance when in tight spaces.  For this reason it  
</I>&gt;<i> does have quite good reverse because I have limited the angle of  
</I>&gt;<i> folding on the prop.  It is quite easy to get up to 5kph in  
</I>&gt;<i> reverse.  So in narrow canals she needs to execute a 3-point turn  
</I>&gt;<i> and think about how the boat will be affected by any wind.  Her  
</I>&gt;<i> Hobie turned much better but she averaged half the speed and had a  
</I>&gt;<i> few scares in strong currents where she could not make headway.
