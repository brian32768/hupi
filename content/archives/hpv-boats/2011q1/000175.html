<PRE>Rick, Ian, et al,

I now have delivery of the flexible cable shafts I ordered. They are 2  
meters long, have a 7.94 wound core, and are made of 316 stainless  
steel. The female couplers on each end accept 12 mm  shafts and have  
an offset 6.35 mm hole drilled for a cotter pin to hold the shaft with  
a corresponding half cut (per Rick's suggestion). The cable is covered  
with a .5&quot; o.d. nylon tube so that the cable can be clamped at various  
points.

These shafts can flex around objects and can even bend to 90 degrees  
with enough curve radius. Possible advantages include using the prop  
for steering and easy prop raising for shallow water.

I am just now setting one up in my workshop, along with an MPB  
MitrpakDrive and our PlanetDrive to see how well they work together.  
All our water is frozen here, so I cannot test outside.

Rick, if you are interested, I will send you one for free given all  
the help you have provided. The shafts can be purchased for US $225,  
US shipping included.

Email me if you are interested and I will send photos.


Thank  you,
