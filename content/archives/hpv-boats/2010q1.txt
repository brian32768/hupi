Hello everybody,

a happy new year to everyone on this list!

Enjoyed the information on your projects last year.

 

May your wishes come true and your new projects enspire us!

 

Best greetings

Hello Rick,
thanks for your excellent report on the 404km Murray Marathon.
Wow - you and your HPB performed just great!
You must have been excited on the first day - according to both heart beat
and speed :-) 
Your folding prop is a big success, too! I agree that you should get rid of
the weed collecting strut.
Seems like your amas touch the surface constantly. With an extremely narrow
width of 225mm you have to ensure stability in one or the other way. I would
be interested in how much drag your amas produce at the present setting.

Best greetings
Clem

Seems like your amas touch the surface constantly. With an extremely  
narrow
width of 225mm you have to ensure stability in one or the other way.  
I would
be interested in how much drag your amas produce at the present setting.

At the start of each day I have about 5kg of water and food on board  
and the stabilisers are on the surface.  As the day wears on the  
water is reduced and I lose body weight.  I end up about 7kg lighter  
at the end of the day and the stabilisers are well clear of the water  
if there are no waves.

I can balance the boat by moving my weight and keep both stabilisers  
above the water.  If they touch it is momentary.  I tend to operate  
these by the sound.  You can hear them clipping the water and if one  
is doing it more than the other I move a little.  In a strong side  
wind I move my back across the seat by 100mm or more.

If there is small chop the stabilisers just clip the tops of the  
waves.  In this condition the boat tends to ride flat without have to  
balance with my body.

Anyhow my aim is to keep the stabilisers off the water and the most  
significant drag from them is windage.

Subject: [hpv-boats] Propulsion ? How do you change from pedal to propeller
	or do you?
Message-ID: <773855.66385.qm@web51305.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

How do you change direxction of the pedal motion right angle(s) to accommodate a propeller?
If you use some sort of right angle gearing where did you find it or did you make it?
If the use of a propeller is to complicated what other means are commonly used among this HPV-boats group?
I would like to find a small right angle drive that I can put in the water and a second that I can somehow connect to the one driving the propeller and drive with a chain? connected to pedals so that I could better vary the gear ratio between the pedals and the propeller.

If varying? the gear ratio does not seem that important then at least I want to really up the RPM's of the propeller at least into the many hundreds of rpm's while keeping my cadence under 80 rpm. My legs feel like limp noodles if I try to keep a cadence over 80 rpm for long but I can easily do 60 to 80 all day long day after day hours on end.
Also I hope to use this on the river so there is the up stream against the current and downstream with the current aspects of a pedal boat.

Subject: [hpv-boats] Right Angle Drive
Message-ID: <AA3F0316-CC05-48FE-BB71-D912F2C9699F@bigpond.net.au>

There are a few manufacturers of angle drives.  Mitrpak are possibly  
the best value.
http://www.mitrpak.com/product_datasheet.php?product_id=34

The best size prop will be spun at 4 to 5 times cadence.  You can use  
a large diameter prop turned at 2 to 3 time cadence directly from a  
gearbox but the box costs quite a lot.

You can also use twisted chain drives.

You can pair two boxes with 1:2 steep up to get combined 1:4 but this  
ends up very expensive.

There is a thread on this forum that has a huge amount of detail with  
photos if you care to wade through it:
