<PRE>Thanks Michael,

Maybe I don't need such a large shaft.  I'm new to this which is why I bring
it up here.  Also, these boats won't be racers by any means.  Just pleasure
craft, though any efficiency is always desirable.

I will need to able to raise the prop maybe 15 degrees to be able to protect
it in shallow water. Will the Love-Joy couplings have that much flex?

I'm unsure what you mean by the Cadence.  Is this another gearbox from
Mitrpak or is it a boat.  I think what you are saying is that Mitrpak makes
a smaller gear box that is on the Cadence which is a boat, maybe your boat.
I see a smaller gearbox at Mitrpak with a 3/8ths shaft.  Is this what you
mean?  Also,  if the Cadence is a boat would you have a link to it?

Thanks for your time,
Ken

The Mitrpak gearbox is an excellent one. The spiral bevel gears provide
very smooth action and the gearbox seals on the stainless shafts protect
the innards quite well in wet environments.

The Cadence uses the next size down, but with a small propeller and a
high shaft rpm it all works out.

Depending on your shaft misalignment and shaft support, you might consider
Love-Joy couplers instead of U-joints. Why do you need such a large shaft
diameter?

Regards,

Michael Lampi

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm planning to build a small pedal powered catamaran, so I will need a
</I>&gt;<i> right angle gearbox.  I have seen this one on the net:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mitrpak.com/product_datasheet.php?product_id=34">http://www.mitrpak.com/product_datasheet.php?product_id=34</A>   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which would serve my needs very well, but it is a bit pricey, though I
</I>would
&gt;<i> pay it if I had to.  My question is where else might I find 90 degree
</I>&gt;<i> gearboxes on-line.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will also need a universal joint for a small shaft, maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> 5/8&quot; or 3/4&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Do any of you know of an on-line supplier for these, stainless steel
</I>&gt;<i> preferred.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
