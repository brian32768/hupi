<PRE>Ian
If the deck is self draning then driving down waves does not matter much.  You just get very wet.  I am surprised you have problems in 6&quot; waves.

V11J can be driven into the back of waves maybe 0.4m high and higher.  I have had the bow submerged for about 2m of its length and believe I could push it deeper if I kept powering.  This hull has virtually zero rocker, a rounded section forward, no hull flare and the same reserve buoyancy bow and stern.

The design for V14 has a flat entry at the bow with quite a lot of rocker that should provide dynamic lift.  The bow is flared and almost 200mm above water level so as it is pushed deeper it will gain considerably more buoyancy.  The stern has very lttle buoyancy so will have little tendency to lift in a following sea. Keeping the stern low helps in keeping the bow up. 

I expect V14 will behave better in a following sea than V11J.  I will have some comparison in a few weeks.  

There could be some advantage in having outriggers with ability to lift but I do not do enough rough water testing to comment from actual experience.  

The OC1 does not bury the bow in a following sea.  Going to windward it takes water into the footwell, which does not self-drain so this is annoying.  Its banana shaped outrigger has a tendency to tip the boat when you travel downwind because it sets up a roll.  Would be better with two outriggers. Despite the bow burying nature of V11J it is a safer boat in &quot;rough&quot; water than the OC1 with a single outrigger.
