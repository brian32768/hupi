Hello Brian,

I would miss it.

Participation and contribution have always varied considerably with 
time on this forum.

When some of the more high-powered contributors defect to a different 
forum, those wishing to benefit from their input, out of necessity, 
can be expected to follow.

However, IMO, the atmosphere of this forum has been unique, 
occasional warts and all,...and more than that, for years it was THE 
forum for the home-designer/builder of hpb's.

The atmosphere I mention depends, of course, on the personalities who 
make up the forum at any given time. The fact that some of the most 
productive and knowledgeable members have taken up residency 
elsewhere may mean that participation here will never reach former 
levels.

But it seems to me that there has been a maturation of the 
field,...and as more people with higher math skills have appeared in 
the forum, and computer programs have been developed to do much of 
the hull/prop, etc. design work,the &quot;fun&quot; of relative amateurs 
playing with ideas and experimenting has to some degree been lost. 
I.e., &quot;Its been done&quot; is increasingly a valid, if discouraging 
observation.

This forum served well for a long time, and perhaps could be 
maintained as more of an &quot;entry level&quot; site for those only beginning 
to explore hpb concepts, ...while the higher-tech design forums are 
offering &quot;state of the art&quot; info for those best able to make use of 
or contribute to it.

I am remembering that apple-box scooters with skate wheels nailed on 
the bottom are a lot of fun for those not at the forefront of 
ever-advancing vehicle design. I would feel that something had been 
lost if there were no place where these people could feel &quot;at home&quot;. 
I am sure that nearly all of the most advanced among us can remember 
the thrill of discovering and meeting the many challenges encountered 
in the &quot;early days&quot; of participation in the field. A certain spirit 
of &quot;play&quot; diminishes as envelope pushing demands always higher 
education/more specialized skills/exotic materials, etc. The 
acquisition of these elements can become a serious, rather than a 
lightly-taken endeavor.

The archives of this forum contain a treasure not to be indifferently 
discarded. Not the Library of Alexandria, perhaps, but a wealth of 
material of interest for everyone who is building an education, 
rather than attempting to jump in at the cutting edge.

Two cents from a long-toothed member.

Best wishes to all,

Larry
