The so-called canoe stern is the most efficient hull form for  
displacement mode.  This is the operating mode for low power that  
humans can generate for the period of time to cover 8km.

If you can produce something like 20W/kg of body weight during a  
sprint then you could get a very light boat to plane.  In this case a  
wide transom would be best and the boat would be quite short.  It  
would not be very good for lower power long distance operation though.

V14 has a flat bottom although it is only 200mm wide at the maximum.   
It has quite a lot of rocker in the hull and tends to lift at speed.  
I got it up to 18kph yesterday after I had done a training stint of  
20km so my legs were not at their strongest. It responds better to  
power than V11J.  I would have been producing around 500W for the  
sprint yesterday.

A great feature of the V14 hull is the ease of flat panel  
construction.  It can be built very quickly.  In 4mm ply it will be  
nice and light and strength should be OK. Using fibreglass tape on  
the seams will make it nice and tight.

This is intended for Rick, whom with his vast computor design  
knowledge can clarify this design query.
I am considering building from 4 mm ply, a hard chined mono-hull  
similar to the V14.
My question concerns the stern, should this be pointed in plan view  
like the V14 or cut square and
maintaining the width of the boat.
This is shown on site www.trimalite.eu 2008 photos or Mike Lampi's  
Cadence.
The boat project is intended for distances of 8 km or more &amp; I am not  
interested in the absolute top speed for
100 m sprints.
