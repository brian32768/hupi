<PRE>Hey Everybody,
 
 
Looks like this list is lighting up.
 
 
I dunno how active I'll be in the near future. All my web-energy is towards 
reinstalling the site. The host that I was under has gone out of business. 
The site is back up, but I have much to do in reconnecting the links and 
posting the rest of the pages. 
 
Went from Elkhart to Bristol the other day via water. It was the first time 
I took a deep draft boat up that far. The last time we went upstream we 
were at the Fun Ride of the Shutt Memorial Hydrobowl. We got stopped by sand 
bars about a third of the way up. This time there was good storms in March and 
Spring runnoff. Went 17 miles without qan incident. 
 
There is usually an athletic festival here over Memorial Day called the 
&quot;Great Race&quot; that has been held for the last thirty years. I'd usually do a 
couple of the events, usually the canoe, always the swim. On a couple of 
occasions, I'd take the rig down the Elkhart River if the usually &quot;marshy&quot; water 
was in rare form and deep enough.
 
The great race has gone out of business, so I'll be itching to try 
something over the holiday. The St Joe has dropped a foot so we'll have to see (my 
big hawg propellers usually draw a couple).
 
Also, I think Daniel has an event on Father's day. If I'm around, I might 
take a stab. It's in St Joe MI; the more the merrier, but let's make sure 
he's doing it.
