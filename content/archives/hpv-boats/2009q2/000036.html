<PRE>Having had quite a bit of experience with pedal boating in water
with waves of up to 8 feet, I generally concur that a pedal boat
with a minimal or no cockpit (or at least a self-bailing one) and
flying amas would generally be the best configuration.

Even with a surfski hull you can find the bow and/or stern digging
into the waves. You just don't want them to stay there.

The Cadence configuration with outriggers has worked out pretty well,
with a propeller directly in front of the stern rudder. That
configuration works far better for maneuvering in the big waves than
one where the prop wash and the rudder are separated by several feet.

</I>&gt;<i> Rick, saw your rendering for a decked in boat for use in open 
</I>&gt;<i> water, would the seat well be self draining? I have taken my 
</I>&gt;<i> boat out on the bay 4 times now ,on calm days with the 
</I>&gt;<i> biggest waves at 6&quot;. Even then it behaves like a submarine, 
</I>&gt;<i> its hardest to handle going before the waves at a 45 deg 
</I>&gt;<i> angle as the boat digs in . Maybe a surfski with a drive leg 
</I>&gt;<i> and two outriggers might be the best layout for an open water 
</I>&gt;<i> hpb as the surfski is a proven design and have the outriggers 
</I>&gt;<i> the same as for an OC1.
