<PRE>Alex
I have posted some details there.  I went down one path for quite a  
bit.  Even got some rough scantlings done but then a fellow provided  
a new direction that I have been exploring.  It is very promising.

The boat sketched on this link will do 8kts with 900W if I can build  
it to target weight:

I have dubbed it a faux-tri because it is a monohul with outriggers  
underwater but looks like a standard monohull topside.  It has better  
accommodation and is shorter than the previous attempt.  It uses many  
of the ideas I have got from pedal boats.  This is partly why I am  
making a flat panel pedal boat because the solar boat will use this  
method and I want to know what is involved.   With the Mars motor I  
currently have this boat should see about 14kts at full tilt.  The  
batteries would drain quickly at this pace though.  I have priced  
lithium batteries and intend to play around with a small battery on  
one of the pedal boats.  We have a solar boat challenge in Australia  
and I might convert a pedal boat to run in this as an interim step.

I am yet to see if it can be built within the weight target.


Rick, I hope you'll keep us posted on your solar boat though, even if  
it's
not really an HPB... Don't suppose your posting on boatdesign.com  
about it
are you?
