<PRE>Late this summer a few of us here at SIGAL Construction are competing in
the Associated Builders &amp; Contractors &quot;Boat Battle&quot;. The boats are to be
constructed of materials that are used in construction (with a little
leeway). The basis of our design is the pedal/pontoon boat from the 1953
*/- &quot;Boy Mechanic magazine. This uses a bicycle frame and a ring and
pinion from a differential. We really need some help with the propeller.
Can they be purchased from a fabricator or does each builder make their
own. 
Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to offer,

Subject: [hpv-boats] Some HPV Archive Files Available

Hello all

It's good to see some activity in this forum again.. Although I don't
speak up often I really enjoy the discussions here.

If anyone is interested, here is a link to a web archive server that has
a lot of the early hpv-boat forum discussions: 

<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20050403170308/www.ihpva.org/pipermail/hpv-bo">http://web.archive.org/web/20050403170308/www.ihpva.org/pipermail/hpv-bo</A>
ats/ 

 It doesn't seem to have everything but there are a lot of discussions
available. Also the server seems to get bogged down occassionally but
try again in a few minutes. It's a great source for finding old web
pages. Here is the link to the archive server: 

<A HREF="http://www.archive.org/index.php">http://www.archive.org/index.php</A> 

I also have about 2000 old posts
 going back to September of 2005 if someone needs specific information
on a subject.
