I kept a tally on the time to build the hull.  I did it over 5 week  
ends but actual work time was 38 hours.  Most of the time was waiting  
for epoxy or paint to cure.

A rough breakup of the time is:
Weekend 1: Make CF-Klegecell flat panels including cutting - 10 hours
Weekend 2: Build stations frame and join panels - 8.5 hours.
Weekend 3: Fair the hull - 4 hours
Weekend 4; Sand hull, set mounting points - 4.5 hours
Weekend 5: Paint and fit drive and rudders - 11 hours

I have photos of what I did but there are much more detailed ones here:

Greg has employed a fellow competent with CF layup although not an  
experienced boat builder.  He is doing a nice job.  Of course this  
boat will be 4 to 5 times heavier than mine.  Estimate for the bare  
hull is 52kg but it has three separate watertight compartments, is 8m  
long and almost 1m beam.

My panels are very simple with just one layer of 200gsm biaxial CF  
either side of 3mm foam.  Even this is very stiff although less than  
4mm thick overall.  I used 450gsm glass tape on the outside of the  
bottom seam to give it some wear resistance.  It added a bit more  
weight but it means I can treat it roughly without fear of damaging  
the CF.

This whole boat does not have a weld in any of the parts.  That is a  
first for me.  I bought an expensive TIG welder and now I am not  
using it!  Actually the prop is fabricated stainless steel so some  
welding there.  I do have a CF Bolly prop I could try on it.  Still  
to make my folding prop.

Would love to watch you build one of these things, start to finish.

A Talented (and prolific) designer/builder, to say the least!

Thanks for sharing the photos.

Best wishes,

Larry
