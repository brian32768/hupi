<PRE>Larry,

Very well articulated. I agree with your thoughts.

Thank you.

Hello Brian,

I would miss it.

Participation and contribution have always varied considerably with&#160;
time on this forum.

When some of the more high-powered contributors defect to a different&#160;
forum, those wishing to benefit from their input, out of necessity,&#160;
can be expected to follow.

However, IMO, the atmosphere of this forum has been unique,&#160;
occasional warts and all,...and more than that, for years it was THE&#160;
forum for the home-designer/builder of hpb's.

The atmosphere I mention depends, of course, on the personalities who&#160;
make up the forum at any given time. The fact that some of the most&#160;
productive and knowledgeable members have taken up residency&#160;
elsewhere may mean that participation here will never reach former&#160;
levels.

But it seems to me that there has been a maturation of the&#160;
field,...and as more people with higher math skills have appeared in&#160;
the forum, and computer programs have been developed to do much of&#160;
the hull/prop, etc. design work,the &quot;fun&quot; of relative amateurs&#160;
playing with ideas and experimenting has to some degree been lost.&#160;
I.e., &quot;Its been done&quot; is increasingly a valid, if discouraging&#160;
observation.

This forum served well for a long time, and perhaps could be&#160;
maintained as more of an &quot;entry level&quot; site for those only beginning&#160;
to explore hpb concepts, ...while the higher-tech design forums are&#160;
offering &quot;state of the art&quot; info for those best able to make use of&#160;
or contribute to it.

I am remembering that apple-box scooters with skate wheels nailed on&#160;
the bottom are a lot of fun for those not at the forefront of&#160;
ever-advancing vehicle design. I would feel that something had been&#160;
lost if there were no place where these people could feel &quot;at home&quot;.&#160;
I am sure that nearly all of the most advanced among us can remember&#160;
the thrill of discovering and meeting the many challenges encountered&#160;
in the &quot;early days&quot; of participation in the field. A certain spirit&#160;
of &quot;play&quot; diminishes as envelope pushing demands always higher&#160;
education/more specialized skills/exotic materials, etc. The&#160;
acquisition of these elements can become a serious, rather than a&#160;
lightly-taken endeavor.

The archives of this forum contain a treasure not to be indifferently&#160;
discarded. Not the Library of Alexandria, perhaps, but a wealth of&#160;
material of interest for everyone who is building an education,&#160;
rather than attempting to jump in at the cutting edge.

Two cents from a long-toothed member.

Best wishes to all,

Larry
