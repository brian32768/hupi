<PRE>Mike
I made the CF panels at home.  This boat is 6m long and is not a  
clone.  It is designed for flat panel construction and shape is  
optimised for this.  It should require 2% less power than V11J  
because I can build it about 8kg lighter.  A hard chine hull is not  
quite as efficient as a rounded chine but it is much faster to build  
unless you have a mould and, if lighter, it can be a better overall  
boat.

I do not use vacuum bagging for my panels but this is no doubt the  
best way.  I lay out cardboard on a flat concrete floor and this is  
covered with plastic.  I then place the sheets of klegecell (Corecell  
would be better), spread epoxy over these then roll out 200gsm bi- 
axial CF cloth.  This is then liberally coated with epoxy. A thicker  
coating of epoxy on a light layup improves compressive strength  
immensely so is worth the weight.  I then lay a smooth layer of  
plastic over the CF and place chipboard sheets on top of this.  Final  
step is to load the boards with weight.  (I do not have a vacuum pump  
and cannot stand running a vacuum cleaner until the epoxy cues.)  I  
repeat the process after rolling the panel over but only after the  
first side has cured.

This is a very good method of construction and gives drum like  
strength.  You can get a basic hull built with about 8 hours effort.  
The time for curing takes much longer of course.

Greg K is presently building his ocean boat and is using flat panel  
construction.  He is being helped by a fellow who does CF parts for  
aircraft but not to recognised standards so I have given Greg some  
ideas on testing the panels to ensure quality control.  The test  
panels they made were quite good on test.  If you track back through  
his blog you will get some details:

Hi Rick,


It is good to hear from you again.

Did you make your own CF skin panels for V14? Are they single layers
or a sandwich?

Also, it appears to have the same or at least similar lines to V11.
Is it a CF clone?

Best regards,

Michael Lampi
