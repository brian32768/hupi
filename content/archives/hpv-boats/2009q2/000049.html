I think I am getting some lift above 15kph as it seems to respond  
well to higher power level.  It is a flat on the bottom but very  
narrow.  It also has a canoe stern, which would not offer much lift.   
It would take about 2kW to get it fully on the plane.  I can generate  
about 600W so a long way short.

If you were going to make a planing hull your best option would be  
something about 3m long with a shallow 'V' of say 5 degrees.  You  
would locate your body about 1m from the stern.  The hull would have  
about 0.6m beam and the transom would be full width.  If you built it  
really light so total weight was around 90kg you might get it to  
plane if you could produce about 1.2kW.  This power level is not  
beyond a sprint cyclist but well beyond most.

There is no doubt that you can fly with good foils.  Again it is  
really important to build light.  I have corresponded on this aspect  
with Mark Drella and he believes they needed about 220W as the  
minimum power to fly faster than you can go in an optimised  
displacement hull.  You need to design well to achieve this but  
having good foils is a starting point.

Those pics are impressive Rick !

Do you rise up in the water at all during your hi speed
runs ?   I was just wondering as I sort of call your
hull shape a battle ship nosed shape.  I guess there
are no planeing  forces that would create any lift
at speed.  It that what has been proven the fastest for
our type boats ?

I have a dual pontoon hydrobike that I envisioned
playing around with perhaps swapping each short pontoon
with a long surfboard or wind surfer board.

I also obtained some used helicopter blades for use
as submerged foils someday.
