<PRE>There has been little activity but I still monitor the site and dig  
into archives now and then.

There are some pedal power threads in BoatDesign and I think more  
people are at least thinking about this sort of boat.  I promote the  
idea there.

I am on to V14 now.  It will be my last pedal boat.  I am fairing the  
hull this weekend,  It is carbon fibre composite.  Before I started  
fairing it weighed in at 9.9kg.  Fairing and paint will add about  
2kg.  Linked picture shows the hull formed up before deck was placed:

I have made carbon fibre frame and outriggers for the latest boat and  
they are in use on V11J.  The frame with seat, gearbox and crank  
weighs 4kg.  Each outrigger weighs 1kg.  You might see I am anal  
about weight but I have found 15kg is infinitely easier for me to  
carry around than 25kg:

This is a rendering I did for a heavier rider for operation in more  
open water:

I have had a young rider on V11J who can hold 16kph over 1000m.  He  
could go further but runs out of lake.
