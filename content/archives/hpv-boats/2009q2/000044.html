<PRE>Gene
Bolly produce a boat prop that has a decent pitch:
<A HREF="http://www.bolly.com.au/models/glasstwo.html">http://www.bolly.com.au/models/glasstwo.html</A>
It is about midway down the page. The 15 X 25.  This is very strong.   
It will suit providing the hull moves easily.

The best boat will be a long slender stabilised monohull.  The hull  
about 7m long and 10 inches wide if it is a single pilot.  Use  
outriggers on either side to stabilise but set them on the loaded  
water level.  They should only kiss the water in operation.

You can make a prop in about 4 hours using mild steel with a welder  
and grinder.  If you want to have a go then I can lead you through  
the process.

This place has some solid model plane props that might do the job  
with the right gearing:
<A HREF="http://www.hobbycity.com/hobbycity/store/uh_viewItem.asp?">http://www.hobbycity.com/hobbycity/store/uh_viewItem.asp?</A> 
idProduct=8081&amp;Product_Name=Master_Airscrew_propeller_16x10
You can see it will need to spin about twice as fast at the Bolly  
boat prop at the same speed.  If your boat is not very efficient then  
this prop could be more suitable.  Hobby City have heaps of props but  
this about the best they have for a single person pedal boat.  If you  
can find one of similar diameter with larger pitch then that will be  
more suitable.



Re: Some HPV Archive Files Available

Late this summer a few of us here at SIGAL Construction are competing in
the Associated Builders &amp; Contractors &quot;Boat Battle&quot;. The boats are to be
constructed of materials that are used in construction (with a little
leeway). The basis of our design is the pedal/pontoon boat from the 1953
*/- &quot;Boy Mechanic magazine. This uses a bicycle frame and a ring and
pinion from a differential. We really need some help with the propeller.
Can they be purchased from a fabricator or does each builder make their
own.
Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to offer,
