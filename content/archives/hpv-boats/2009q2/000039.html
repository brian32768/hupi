<PRE>Rick
        Am being cautious out on the bay, I go from
Patterson River, if its too rough I stay in the river.
Boat has 100mm freeboard so is very wet and dives
into every wave. I have fitted a breakwater and this helps,
I thought of moving the outriggers further forward so 
when running down the waves I would get better lift
and not keep diving.
         The flex shaft is working well but when I try
peddling hard I can feel a dead spot, like I can't push any harder. 
         I have been thinking of getting a 1:1 right angle
gearbox and joining it to the involute gear box to make a
drive leg. Advantage would be launch and transport a
lot easier. But more drag and sealing the underwater
gearbox might be a problem.
        Went to the lake last Saturday and its the worst
it's been for weeds, had to stop at least 4 times to clear
them.
