<PRE>The Escargot is a real human powered barge-like houseboat. When I pedaled
the original boat freshly launched on Lake Union many years ago with
another strong pedaler, we were working very hard to get the boat to move.
Unfortunately, we had no speed measuring tools, and there was quite a
breeze to contend with. The large, flat sides and flat bottom made
maneuvering and staying on course difficult.

Note that the boat I pedaled had no equipment, bedding, food, etc.,
installed, either.

In a canal environment it would probably be a good fit, especially if
fitted with bumpers all around.

Clem's trial boat probably did have some bottom fouling, but that boat
would not move very quickly under human power.

</I>&gt;<i> The claimed performance with two pedallers is 6.4kph.  Was the bottom
</I>&gt;<i> fouled?  That will make a huge difference on any heavy boat where
</I>&gt;<i> viscous drag dominates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also the two Seacycle units are not well matched to heavy loads.  The
</I>&gt;<i> pedal drive I have for the 8t catamaran swings a 780mm diameter large
</I>&gt;<i> model aeroplane prop.  Large swept area becomes more critical to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve efficiency with heavy load at low speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A well designed 1t boat should be capable of sustaining between 7 to
</I>&gt;<i> 8kph with two pedallers working around 100W.  Typically a sailing
</I>&gt;<i> boat hull will be a bit easier to drive than the barge type hull.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do agree with the conclusion that weight is important but probably
</I>&gt;<i> not as bad as your experience suggests.  The 5m length limit for free
</I>&gt;<i> passage may be more serious.

</I>&gt;<i> This summer I experienced a three day trip on an Escargot, a human
</I>&gt;<i> powered
</I>&gt;<i> boat weighing roughly one ton. The Escargot (literally translated
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;snail&quot;),
</I>&gt;<i> designed by naval architect Philip Thiel is a charming tiny houseboat,
</I>&gt;<i> indeed.
</I>&gt;<i> Yet it takes some patience to get adapted to its speed limit.
</I>&gt;<i> Cruising speed
</I>&gt;<i> without auxiliary power (electric) was around 3 km per hour. Powered
</I>&gt;<i> by 2
</I>&gt;<i> adults - each one contributing around 100 Watts.
</I>&gt;<i> For more information on the &quot;Escargot&quot; see: <A HREF="http://www.gruene-flotte.de/">http://www.gruene-flotte.de/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My conclusion from this 3 day trip:
</I>&gt;<i> Human powered boats should rather be lightweight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes
