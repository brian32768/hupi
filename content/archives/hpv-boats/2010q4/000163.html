Subject: [hpv-boats] V15-5m Update


&gt;<i> My sister finally got down to Melbourne to test the boat I built for  her. 
</I>&gt;<i> She is able to do 8kph at a relaxed, sustainable power lever  and can push 
</I>&gt;<i> up to 12kph for a minute or so.  The corresponding  speeds for effort in 
</I>&gt;<i> her Hobie flapper are 5kph and 7kph.  This is a  clip from last weekend 
</I>&gt;<i> (3.3Mb):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_Donna_1.wmv">http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_Donna_1.wmv</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the noise is wind and my outriggers slapping the ripples.   The 
</I>&gt;<i> gearbox noise on her boat can be heard when she pushes her speed  up.  As 
</I>&gt;<i> a matter of interest she later tested with my cycling shoes  rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> the rubber beach shoes and found those more natural  although they are a 
</I>&gt;<i> couple of sizes too big.  The pedals can be used  with or without cleated 
</I>&gt;<i> shoes or even bare feet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have modified the boat somewhat from the original build.  The main 
</I>&gt;<i> change is the gearbox.  The initial box was a Mitrpak T-102-M  modified 
</I>&gt;<i> for cranks.  I broke one of these pushing the boat up to  around 13kph and 
</I>&gt;<i> a friend broke one just accelerating - told him to  stay below 12kph but 
</I>&gt;<i> did not say do not accelerate hard.  The boxes  fail at the high speed 
</I>&gt;<i> shaft.  I have rebuilt one using higher  strength steel in the shaft and 
</I>&gt;<i> Mitrpak are supplying redesigned  shafts that will be stronger than the 
</I>&gt;<i> original.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Irrespective of the Mitrpak box improvements I decided there are a  few 
</I>&gt;<i> disadvantages to swinging the 540mm prop required for a 1:2  ratio.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> 1:4 box I have made has at least three times the torque  rating of the 
</I>&gt;<i> Mitrpak box and allows me to swing a 400mm prop.  The  box has straight 
</I>&gt;<i> cut bevel gears because these cost less than spiral  bevel and I was a 
</I>&gt;<i> little uncertain I could achieve the required  fabricating tolerances with 
</I>&gt;<i> my little mill and lathe.  If I make more  boxes I will use spiral bevel 
</I>&gt;<i> gears mainly because they run quieter.   They also have slightly higher 
</I>&gt;<i> ultimate strength and many times  higher wear life although I doubt the 
</I>&gt;<i> latter will ever get tested on  a pedal boat.  The box weighs 2.5kg.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I now have to make a few minor adjustments and clean the boat up  before 
</I>&gt;<i> the road trip to the Gold Coast at the end of the year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

Thanks for the report. On the gear box strength issues, I often wondered 
about some kind of slip clutch mechanism to protect from shock overloads. 
That could save someone from being stranded or being knocked out of a race. 
Something might be worked out with say, super strong magnets to be used for 
coupling the shafts without having the slippage drawback of friction based 
units. I can visualize someone going full tilt on the Murray and hitting a 
log or rock thus breaking or bending something that can be repaired 
rapidly....
