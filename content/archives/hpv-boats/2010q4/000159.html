<PRE>Hi Rick,
good questions!
Although I swam in the Ruhr at least twice a day I did not inspect the
bottom thoroughly. I do remember some green stuff and some mussels on the
rudder and on the auxiliary electric drive. These are hints for severe
fouling on the bottom, too.

The &quot;green fleet&quot; of Escargot boats on the Ruhr does not use the Seacycle's
drive units.
Instead, two bicycle pedal units are connected to a single propeller. I
guess the setup is not very efficient - but it sure makes a lot of noise.

Thank you for the interesting data on heavier HPBs!

Two days after our 3-day trip on the Escargot, Caroline and I made a bike
tour along the french canal connecting the rivers Rhine and Marne.
What a sensation of speed!! It felt like flying along the banks of the canal
at low level. Even the numerous locks could'nt slow down our amazing fast
flight :-))  


In August I finally took the effort to start with the new platform for the
Seacycle.
It took a lot of time but so far it has been a good experience and
successful project.
Dimensions are 2.4 x 1.6 x 0.12 meters.
The construction made of carbon fibre, epoxy resin and foam weighs 17 kg,
additional weight is caused by rudder, steering handle and by the wooden
planks (thin and small) on top.    
On Saturday I want to test the new setup on a nearby lake. 
Will send some photos.

Best greetings 
Clem

The claimed performance with two pedallers is 6.4kph.  Was the bottom  
fouled?  That will make a huge difference on any heavy boat where  
viscous drag dominates.

Also the two Seacycle units are not well matched to heavy loads.  The  
pedal drive I have for the 8t catamaran swings a 780mm diameter large  
model aeroplane prop.  Large swept area becomes more critical to  
achieve efficiency with heavy load at low speed.

A well designed 1t boat should be capable of sustaining between 7 to  
8kph with two pedallers working around 100W.  Typically a sailing  
boat hull will be a bit easier to drive than the barge type hull.

I do agree with the conclusion that weight is important but probably  
not as bad as your experience suggests.  The 5m length limit for free  
passage may be more serious.

This summer I experienced a three day trip on an Escargot, a human  
powered
boat weighing roughly one ton. The Escargot (literally translated  
&quot;snail&quot;),
designed by naval architect Philip Thiel is a charming tiny houseboat,
indeed.
Yet it takes some patience to get adapted to its speed limit.  
Cruising speed
without auxiliary power (electric) was around 3 km per hour. Powered  
by 2
adults - each one contributing around 100 Watts.
For more information on the &quot;Escargot&quot; see: <A HREF="http://www.gruene-flotte.de/">http://www.gruene-flotte.de/</A>

My conclusion from this 3 day trip:
Human powered boats should rather be lightweight.

Best wishes
Clemens
