<PRE>Hello,
as far as I know, the 5 meter limit is valid at least here in France.
If you are interested in auxiliary electric power you should have a look at
the torqueedo products which seem to be more efficient than some other
competitors - see
<A HREF="http://www.torqeedo.com/en/hn/products/cruise-r/product-description.html">http://www.torqeedo.com/en/hn/products/cruise-r/product-description.html</A>   

I'm not sure to which degree auxiliary pedal power can contribute to move
heavy boats.

This summer I experienced a three day trip on an Escargot, a human powered
boat weighing roughly one ton. The Escargot (literally translated &quot;snail&quot;),
designed by naval architect Philip Thiel is a charming tiny houseboat,
indeed. 
Yet it takes some patience to get adapted to its speed limit. Cruising speed
without auxiliary power (electric) was around 3 km per hour. Powered by 2
adults - each one contributing around 100 Watts. 
For more information on the &quot;Escargot&quot; see: <A HREF="http://www.gruene-flotte.de/">http://www.gruene-flotte.de/</A>

My conclusion from this 3 day trip: 
Human powered boats should rather be lightweight.

Best wishes 
Clemens

HI Roger,

You have named my dream trip ... please tell me more.  I was going to use a
5 meter sail boat with a cat mizzen rigging as boats are taxed and charged
by length and I am told that 5 meters is the limit of free boats.  I wanted
electric power too.  I had the ideal boat for many years 5 meters and slept
4.  I only needed two but guests are nice.  carry a scooter on deck for land
transport and a bicycle. too.  I would love to know all your details.

Huggs and my best wishes,
Bobby Ray
