<PRE>HI Roger,

You have named my dream trip ... please tell me more.  I was going to use a
5 meter sail boat with a cat mizzen rigging as boats are taxed and charged
by length and I am told that 5 meters is the limit of free boats.  I wanted
electric power too.  I had the ideal boat for many years 5 meters and slept
4.  I only needed two but guests are nice.  carry a scooter on deck for land
transport and a bicycle. too.  I would love to know all your details.

Huggs and my best wishes,
Bobby Ray
