The claimed performance with two pedallers is 6.4kph.  Was the bottom  
fouled?  That will make a huge difference on any heavy boat where  
viscous drag dominates.

Also the two Seacycle units are not well matched to heavy loads.  The  
pedal drive I have for the 8t catamaran swings a 780mm diameter large  
model aeroplane prop.  Large swept area becomes more critical to  
achieve efficiency with heavy load at low speed.

A well designed 1t boat should be capable of sustaining between 7 to  
8kph with two pedallers working around 100W.  Typically a sailing  
boat hull will be a bit easier to drive than the barge type hull.

I do agree with the conclusion that weight is important but probably  
not as bad as your experience suggests.  The 5m length limit for free  
passage may be more serious.

This summer I experienced a three day trip on an Escargot, a human  
powered
boat weighing roughly one ton. The Escargot (literally translated  
&quot;snail&quot;),
designed by naval architect Philip Thiel is a charming tiny houseboat,
indeed.
Yet it takes some patience to get adapted to its speed limit.  
Cruising speed
without auxiliary power (electric) was around 3 km per hour. Powered  
by 2
adults - each one contributing around 100 Watts.
For more information on the &quot;Escargot&quot; see: <A HREF="http://www.gruene-flotte.de/">http://www.gruene-flotte.de/</A>

My conclusion from this 3 day trip:
Human powered boats should rather be lightweight.

Best wishes
Clemens
