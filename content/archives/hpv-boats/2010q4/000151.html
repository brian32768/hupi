<PRE>Thought this concept might be of interest:

<A HREF="http://www.hydrovisions.com/">http://www.hydrovisions.com/</A>

Maybe the concept could be worked to make the hydrofoil run shallow and self 
adjusting at speed. That might get the proa or even a cat to work like a 
single, more efficient hull even in chop. Think it would be better than 
trimaran outriggers slamming into waves?

Also on the folding prop, seems easier to make at least since there is no 
welding involved?

Subject: [hpv-boats] Folding Prop


&gt;<i> Dennis
</I>&gt;<i> My folding prop is slightly more efficient than the fixed blades I have.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a prop optimising program that I use for prop design.  It is a  bit 
</I>&gt;<i> more flexible than JavaProp and I can use a wide range of foil  sections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are interested in a design I can give you something that is 
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably easy to make using stainless flatbar.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv-boats">rickwill at bigpond.net.au</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may sound odd but I have seen quite a few people mount blades 
</I>&gt;<i> backwards on boats.  They have the curved face facing aft.  This  alters 
</I>&gt;<i> the effective pitch considerably from what is designed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rick
</I>&gt;<i> I checked out a rigid prop fitted to my small cat and was very  surprised 
</I>&gt;<i> to find
</I>&gt;<i> that the speeds and the cadence were identical to my new boat fitted  with 
</I>&gt;<i> the folding prop
</I>&gt;<i> It is quite difficult to get exact figures due to the river current  which 
</I>&gt;<i> made a difference of 10%
</I>&gt;<i> based on 80 rpm.
</I>&gt;<i> It all ended with a bang when I hit something under water and bent  one 
</I>&gt;<i> arm of the prop
</I>&gt;<i> back 40 mm.
</I>&gt;<i> I have concluded that my props are rubbish and I am going back to the 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning on the design.
