I delivered V15-5m to my sister on the Gold Coast in southern  
Queensland.

We had some nice time on the water near her home on the Gold Coast.

This is a series of clips taken on the Nerang River:

She has hundreds of kilometers of similar waterways all connected and  
many launching points only a few minutes drive from her house.

The warmer water was nice for some speed runs.  I hit 18.4kph during  
this run:

If you look closely the lift due to dynamic forces is apparent.  The  
small waves amplify it in the clip.  In calm water I get the first  
600mm of the bow clear of the water.

         V15 looks good, must be a great place for these
sort of boats. Is the gearbox the original Mitrepak one
or have you upgraded it?

Cool design. Up higher from the water, yet the fairing behind the seat would 
appear to reduce wind resistance. Seems to give a dry ride to the pedaller. 
Thanks for posting.

I made the gearbox from a purchased 1:4 gearset.  They are straight  
cut bevel gears that cost USD100.

The gearbox is noisier than spiral bevel gears but similar efficiency.

This one weighed 2.8kg however I have since modified the design and  
will use spiral bevel gears for the next one. The gearset is heavier  
but the box will be lighter.

I repaired one of the Mitrpak boxes I broke using higher strength  
steel.  It will take at least 300W now.  In the end I did not like  
the 1:2 ratio for such a light boat.  The big prop is a nuisance for  
a variety of reasons. One less obvious problem is the induced roll  
due to the higher torque.  It also has a greater tendency to "walk"  
sideways than a higher speed prop.

As far as gear ratio goes I determine a step up ratio between 4 to 5  
to be near optimum for an easily driven boat.  Your 1:3.3 is not far  
off optimum - way better than 1:2.  You only problem is getting a  
shaft that is stiff enough torsionally while still able to curve.

Vic
The height of the seat on V15 is not much different to V14.  The step  
in the deckline gives the impression of the seat being higher.

The low deck at the cranks means the seating can be more upright,  
which is something my sister wanted.  I prefer being more reclined  
but like the low deck at the crank to keep the feet lower.  Helps  
with blood flow to the feet.  Once moving there is little tendency  
for water to wash onto the lower deck in waves because the divergent  
wave from the bow forms a trough along the side of the hull. This  
will be less so with a 6m long hull because the divergent waves are  
smaller.

I have continued to play with the V15 design mainly to simplify  
construction and improve load paths for strength.  There are a few  
people building various alternatives of this design.

I would not recommend the extended fairing behind the seat.  It does  
reduce frontal windage but this can be achieved with a shorter tail- 
box.  It increases the roll force when side on to wind.  With wind on  
the bow quarter there is a noticeable tendency to sail but this has  
limited application.

The V15 design has a distinct advantage over V14 when pushing into  
wind and waves.  There is no tendency for water to wash back over the  
bow when it buries and the reduced windage is significant in even  
slight wind.  It also surfs better because the bow does not dive and  
it does not flop roll with the outriggers set aft.

The flat rocker increases the turning circle over V14 and this  
requires making allowance when in tight spaces.  For this reason it  
does have quite good reverse because I have limited the angle of  
folding on the prop.  It is quite easy to get up to 5kph in reverse.   
So in narrow canals she needs to execute a 3-point turn and think  
about how the boat will be affected by any wind.  Her Hobie turned  
much better but she averaged half the speed and had a few scares in  
strong currents where she could not make headway.

I think the advice on a step up of 1:5 or less only pertains to a  
situation where the fluctuating torque of a single rider is used.  It  
reduces the loss during the low-power parts of the cycle.  The high  
pitch is a compromise, pushing water around as much as back.   
Usually, the best efficiency is found when the pitch and diameter are  
nearly the same, leading to a step-up of around 1:10 for a tandem  
with the pedals out of phase.

Message-ID: <DB073EBA-07B7-46B4-B748-0ABDD7C78EF6@bigpond.net.au>

I am discussing a single person easily driven displacement hull.

The optimisation around a ratio of 4 to 5 considers many factors:
1.  I am running a 390mm diameter prop achieving 3.1m/s at 75rpm on  
the crank.  Pitch of current prop is nominally 620mm. So P/D is 1.6.
2. The optimum P/D is a function of the L/D of the blades.  The lower  
the L/D the higher the P/D for best efficiency.  I am achieving an L/ 
D around 20 at my operating condition over the working portion of the  
blade. The most efficient part of the blade is toward the outside of  
the blade.  My current blades have slightly larger chord toward the  
outside but it is not much better than just constant chord blades,  
which I often use.
3. With the large diameter to thrust, I have very low disc loading so  
this results in low slip - or high actuator disc efficiency.
4.  The large diameter enables me to use only two blade prop while  
still keeping high aspect blades.  This reduces induced drag on the  
blades.  These two blades have sufficient strength to transmit the  
thrust without flexing noticeably.  The minimum chord for a steel  
blade capable of taking full sprint thrust of say 100N is not less  
than 20mm.
5. The torsional stiffness of the drive train favours spinning the  
prop faster to avoid poor RMS to average power.  This was a key  
factor with my dislike for the 1:2 ratio.  For this reason I consider  
1:4 about the minimum ratio with a shaft drive system although there  
may be some layup of carbon fibre that would work at lower ratios  
without becoming unreasonably heavy.

I could not imagine the circumstances with a displacement boat where  
a ratio of 1:10 would result in the best efficiency.  There may be a  
situation with very easily driven boat such as a hydrofoil where 1:10  
could be close to optimum.  With my boat using a 250mm diameter prop  
I would throw away 7% in disc losses compared with 3% with the 390mm  
prop.

If anyone is interested in prop optimisation they might find these  
notes of interest:
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-23-hydrofoils-and- 
propellers-spring-2007/readings/kerwin_notes.pdf
There are some useful curves toward the end that can be applied even  
to the lightly loaded case of a pedal boat prop.

       Have been playing around a bit with shafts and
have got a straight 16mm aluminium shaft held in
place with a skeg. The angle is 16 deg which is way
off optimum but makes setting up easier. The flex 
shafts always hit a dead spot at high revs and limits
the top speed. I can lower the gearbox another 100mm
by cutting out part of the hull for my feet and this improves
the angle to 11deg. Don't know if the effort of doing this
will greatly improve the performance, a bit of work and
more weight.

The angle does not affect efficiency greatly.  The main problem is  
the vibration and high bending loads.  If you have to go to a heavy  
shaft to reduce torsional compliance then it will be strong enough to  
take the bending loads.  However I once bent a 12mm aluminium shaft  
when going hard with a 1:3.5 reduction.

My main issue with the inclined shaft is the ever present vibration.   
It gets more noticeable as you go faster.  If this is not annoying  
you then live with the current inclination.  You are probably looking  
at hull number 3 to do the stepped deck.  I keep simplifying this  
arrangement so it is easier to make.

I have had a carbon fibre shaft wound for me with only diagonal  
fibres so it is stiff torsionally but compliant in bending.  I am yet  
to install it on anything.  It weighs a fraction of steel and even  
lighter than aluminium but 4 times stiffer torsionally than my  
current steel shaft.

I have a reasonably accurate model now for assessing the impact of  
shaft compliance.  A 12mm Al shaft that is 3m long, using your 1:3.3  
ratio, will be robbing around 8% of your power input due to the shaft  
torsional compliance.

I should see you at the lake tomorrow.

I forgot to add that going up to 16mm reduces the apparent loss to  
the compliance to 1%.  So it is a significant improvement and close  
to as good as you can get with a shaft drive system.  It will feel  
very well connected to the prop.

Your 16mm shaft has 60% of the stiffness of the 13.7mm OD, 10mm ID CF  
shaft I have to test.

If you are interested I can show you the dynamic analysis at my place  
later in the day. Also the CF shaft and other things I am playing with.

Rick, Ian, et al,

I now have delivery of the flexible cable shafts I ordered. They are 2  
meters long, have a 7.94 wound core, and are made of 316 stainless  
steel. The female couplers on each end accept 12 mm  shafts and have  
an offset 6.35 mm hole drilled for a cotter pin to hold the shaft with  
a corresponding half cut (per Rick's suggestion). The cable is covered  
with a .5" o.d. nylon tube so that the cable can be clamped at various  
points.

These shafts can flex around objects and can even bend to 90 degrees  
with enough curve radius. Possible advantages include using the prop  
for steering and easy prop raising for shallow water.

I am just now setting one up in my workshop, along with an MPB  
MitrpakDrive and our PlanetDrive to see how well they work together.  
All our water is frozen here, so I cannot test outside.

Rick, if you are interested, I will send you one for free given all  
the help you have provided. The shafts can be purchased for US $225,  
US shipping included.

Email me if you are interested and I will send photos.

While you are testing in the workshop can you measure the torsional  
stiffness.  If you just give me the degrees it flexes with a certain  
load at a known radius I can calculate the torsional stiffness.

 From this value I can work out the apparent loss in the drive  
train.  If this is similar to the CF shaft I have I will be  
interested in testing one.

My CF shaft is 3.1m long but it only needs to curve over 1.2m of its  
length.  It would be easy to make a rigid extension from your shaft  
to get the required length for an aft mounted prop.  The one-off CF  
shaft cost me AUD300 but the cost would reduce for higher quantity.

I am now mounting the prop behind the hull so it can easily flex  
upward if it hits something solid.  I used a 10mm X 3mm tension strut  
on V15 that can slide upward.

A friend, building a pedal boat here, copied one of my fixed bladed  
props and has moulded aluminium and bronze blades from the resulting  
pattern.  He is also working on a lighter nylon/glass version.  He  
only has a couple at this stage and he gave me one with aluminium  
blades for testing.  It suits a ratio around 1:4 or a bit lower if  
the hull moves easily.  The linked image gives an idea of what the  
bronze one looks like:

Hi Rick, Mark and all
I believe there is 'enough interest' both for the propeller and a complete
flex shaft propulsion system.
This opinion comes from the sustained growth of the Open Waterbike Project:
the community is still tiny (just over ten thousand unique vistors, just a
few hundreds members)  but autonomously growing nothwhitstanding our very
limited resources. We have requests from individuals and firms, coming in
 from countries as different as Brasil, Turkey, India (but now the
baricenter has shifted from Europe to the US). Most people and perspective
dealers and manufacturers are intersted in buying the drive system, while it
seems appealing to most is the possibility of building locally  hulls and
other less critical and cumbersome parts, and they seek technical support
for that.
I reckon the availability of a complete high performance drive system will
be the turning point: maybe the dream of an 'Open' high performance pedal
boat has a real possibility of becoming reality after all..m.

Hi Rick

As you are aware I have suffered several design failures on my manufactured props caused by excessive slipping of up to 30%.
This stalling was virtually throughout the operational range and predicted by Theo Schmidt in his 1999 paper on Propsim.
He advises slender type blades with high pitch /dia ratios are subject to stalling.
My APC 16 x16 only slipped a maximum of  2 to 3 % but when I made a new version with a pitch of 24" the problem started.
Your design for the constant cord prop suffered slightly worse, but the problem was over come by widening the cord which I did to the extreme ( this I believe created increased drag due to the larger surface area).
The slipping is created by the greater resistance of my boat compared to your V14 boat
What this really shows is that there can be no hard and fast rules as the prop must be tuned to the application ie the boat.
I like you feel that a 4 to 1 gear ratio is about right, bur like Bob Stuart I also feel that  if the pitch and dia are equal the prop is more flexible 
and even though the revs would be higher the efficiency might be better.  To sum it up regardless of the prop design programmes, prop design it still very trial and error

I expect when you get your stabilisers mounted at the right height  
you will find the narrow chord, high pitch prop will work fine.  They  
may need a redesign to work well.

Right now your boat has much more drag than it should.  In your  
summer I hope you get the opportunity to set it up correctly.  The  
stabilisers should literally skim the surface once at design speed.   
My stabilises sit about 20mm above the surface when at rest.  At  
11kph the sinkage and bow wave combine to get their stern just  
touching.  This is what you should aim for.

The prop design can be done with great precision but it is reliant on  
accurate determination of the boat drag, which equals the prop  
thrust.  Your main hull is not draggy but your stabilises will be if  
continually loaded in any way.

I have found flat bottom stabilises, 2m long and 100mm wide to be  
about the best.  They achieve close to maximum stability as soon as  
they hit the surface. So there is little tendency to flop roll even  
though they sit above the surface most of the time in calm water or  
clip waves in rougher water.

If you cannot reduce the drag then you would be better off going to a  
slightly larger diameter prop with similar pitch and slightly large  
blade area.  But you should fix the high drag problem before going to  
this measure.

My prop blades usually operate with a negative angle of attack so are  
a long way from stalling.  The 25mm chord is a little more forgiving  
in strong wind than a wider blade.

You will note that the prop my friend has copied and turned into a  
folding prop has a maximum chord of 45mm.  This will work OK on quite  
draggy hulls but is not as efficient as my 25mm chord on V14.

I am glad you find 1:4 a nice ratio and look forward to some more  
performance results when you get decent stabilises properly set.   
This is where you will get the most immediate gain.  Then try the  
25mm chord prop.

Dennis, I think the statements above are a good summary.  I would approach 
it by defining the end goal first and consider the motor you have to work 
with, then work backwards. Prioritize the main goal whether it is sprinting, 
endurance, draft, weight,  durability, etc. Computer design programs can be 
helpful but tweaking through dynamic testing can be used for further 
improvement.  I think
Rick does that on some level, otherwise why all the different creations? His 
sister's boat uses a limited range folder and perhaps has other changes 
compared to his own...

Some time ago I took a clip of one of my stabilises operating in calm  
water.

The boat is doing about 10kph in this clip:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Stabiliser.wmv
The port stabiliser is doing exactly the same because the boat was  
level.  That is all they should be doing if set up right.  In waves  
they can be even set higher but I do not have easy adjustment to  
enable that.

The initial stability is related to the second moment of area of the  
water plane alone.  So what counts is how much moment you gain with a  
slight list.  Having a long flat stabiliser set about 1m from the  
centre of the main hull will rapidly increase the second moment of  
area with very little list.  Being long and slender the drag does not  
increase much if it is lightly loaded.  That is the objective I set  
out to achieve with the shape of my stabilisers.

This commercial product is not a flex shaft, but is available for those 
inquires looking for a drive system. http://www.prophish.com/pedalboats.html 
It appears to be a rugged (Jose's adventure NY-Rio), somewhat adaptable unit 
with built in steering and easy lift and lower. Don't know the drive ratio, 
but possibly adaptable to a version of Rick's prop which would improve 
efficiency.

Hope this helps.

Hello Rick,

Though I mostly "lurk" in this forum these days, i always appreciate 
the contributions of you and others who have much more understanding of
the design use of math, computers, etc., than myself. Prop-stuff is way 
over my head. ;-)

Regarding your suggestion for stabilizer shape:  I am wondering whether 
facts related to "planing" conditions entered into your "flat bottom" 
decision, ...i.e. when visualizing the stabilizer as an independent 
hull, the speed/length ratio of the immersed portion of the stabilizer 
is very much greater than that of the main hull, and thus into commonly 
accepted "planing" territory. Also, as the main hull bow rises with 
speed, the stabilizer angle of attack may approach (or could be 
designed to approach) nearly ideal planing angles (4-5 degrees?)?

Of course choppy water changes the AofA constantly, but it seems likely 
that in calm water these observations would be pertinent.

Unless the hull is momentarily overly unstable, only the rearmost 
undersurface of the stabilizer should be in contact, so the aspect 
ratio of the contact area should also be in a favorable range for 
planing.

I'd value your thoughts,

PS - I remain in awe of your speed of implementation of ideas and 
fabrication of models!

Sorry , but I must have confused you slightly, the boat was fitted with narrow flat bottomed stabilisers for the last few tests. These were mounted about 30 mm clear of the water surface and parallel to the boat bottom
.
I still suspect the 185 mm wide square stern and have been thinking of raising this up by moving the my seat and drive system 75 mm forward. which intern would lower the front slightly.

You are right about the stabilisers operating primarily with dynamic  
lift at typical operating speed because they are very lightly loaded.

I consider the shape I have arrived at hard to better for all round  
performance.  There would be advantage in being able to trim the  
height when in operation but mine are set at a suitable average.

Wide transoms on planing hulls actually suck the stern down at semi- 
planing speed so readily trim bow-up and then provide a high aspect  
lifting surface at the transom when at high speed.  So they are  
beneficial where there is a lot of power to get on the plane and then  
operate at high speed.  A wide transom would not offer any benefit on  
my stabilisers and would add extra drag when pushing through waves.

I had not realised you had built new stabilisers.

When you get back on the water I would be interested in seeing some  
video of your boat in operation.

There is some potential for aft-down trim to add noticeable drag.   
There would be considerable turbulence associated with the sort of  
energy you are losing and a video will help identify where the  
problem is.

If the stabilisders are no longer dragging then your proposal to  
shift weight forward to lift the stern is a good option for next trial.

The tools are there to optimise your hull shape for minimum drag and  
this will be a much faster method of arriving at the best hull than  
endless trial and error.

       Had the boat out on Saturday afternoon at the lake.
Weather was calm so I raised the outriggers another
20mm. The boat boat felt a bit unstable with the outriggers
just touching the water. Cranked the speed up for a few
sprints but as I don't have a GPS couldn't tell you the
speed. The straight shaft enables me to push hard without
hitting a dead spot, the shaft angle of 16 deg means a 
loss in efficiency. Quite a bit of weed about so I mainly 
stayed down the southern end trying to pace the sailing boats. Current setup has a skeg which adds to the drag 
and might try a smaller rudder next time. Overall pleased
with the way the boat is, light to carry and quick and
easy to setup.

I left the lake around midday Saturday - a pity I did not see you.

I thought your outriggers were reasonably well adjusted previously.   
You want them positioned so you your are stable when moving.  This  
will mean a little flop roll at rest.

The 16mm shaft is 3X stiffer torsionally than the 12mm and improves  
RMS to average power input substantially.  You could still get a  
curved shaft of similar torsional stiffness by combining the 16mm  
aluminium through the hull with 8mm spring steel below the hull.  The  
length of steel just enough to give the curve. I can help with the  
join.  This is what I ended up doing on V15.

I did a couple of full length runs of the lake now that it is near  
full height but weed was a nuisance.  The folding prop sheds it OK  
but it means regularly coasting to fold the blades.

You need to get a GPS so you can get some measured data.   Maybe next  
weekend we can have good weather and be somewhere at the same time.

How bad is the prop vibration?

       When I first used the 16mm rigid shaft it vibrated 
a bit but its something I don't notice now. Inside the 16mm
aluminium tube I have a wooden rod glued into place.
I kept coating the rod with an expanding glue as I 
pushed it into the tube. This makes the shaft more rigid 
as well as a bit stiffer torsionally.
        With the 16mm shaft angle I am thinking of making
another prop with a different pitch. For example the prop
at one point is angled at 55 deg but with the 16 deg shaft
angle the actual angle is 71 deg. The prop is only at
optimum in the horizontal and looses in the vertical. If
I made a 4 blade prop with a different pitch to suit the
shaft angle there would be more prop at optimum thrust.
I might be way out here but it would be interesting to see
how such a prop would work.
        Where I often go at the rowing course and the river 
weed is not a problem, just bump into a jellyfish now
and then.
         Had a lot of expenses of late so the GPS has 
been put on the backburner. Have to do timed runs at 
the rowing course.

if you are using a rigid prop,it is possible to modify the prop mounting so that you achieve no vibration and get the full power out of the prop. This requires a small slot in the prop hub so that it can pivot around a pin and be vertical when in the vertical plain.  This is a sort of restricted universal joint that was developed by David Witt at Oxford university.

I have wondered if this system could be further refined so that it would operate on a folding prop with suitable positioned stops.

Message-ID: <70077A14-7E30-49BF-9DF1-7DBC27769DF5@bigpond.net.au>

I have been playing around with the idea of making a magnetic right  
angle drive unit for a while.  Over the past few months I invested in  
some magnets and built a prototype:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCuCmzcjpao

The video shows the torque test.  I have a 5kg weight suspended on a  
lever arm connected to the output shaft.  The lever gets out to 230mm  
before the magnets let go. This particular variant has a ratio of  
1:3.3 and gives in at 11Nm on the output shaft.

The torque at this ratio is ample for cruising to speed of up to  
12.5kph but would give out in a sprint.

The unit was not executed to the initial design because I could not  
get the quantity of magnets of the particular size I wanted.  It was  
intended as a 1:5 step up but I could not get the alignment right  
with only 4 magnets on the output so went up to 6 thus reducing the  
ratio.  However I got better than a commensurate increase in torque.

This unit is extremely robust and heavier than I would want in a  
boat.  One feature is that the weight is distributed at a large  
radius so the crank and output both have high rotational inertia -  
flywheels if you like.  This leads to smoother pedaling and can  
compensate a little for a torsionally compliant prop shaft.   Another  
feature is the load limiting on the prop shaft.

If I made it to tighter tolerance I could get higher torque.  In a  
way this would defeat the original idea because I was exploring the  
concept for ease of building without need for precision machining.

I expect with ideal magnet selection and simple method of  
construction this arrangement could be built for under AUD200.

          On my first boat I had two universal joints
to get the prop vertical. The shaft coming off the
gearbox was 25 deg and it resulted in the first change
in angle at 14 deg and the second at 11 deg. I broke
both universal joints at different times. After upgrading 
to stronger ones I still had problems with the pins
working loose. Also it was not a smooth pedalling
action because of the angle. 
         Would be interested to have a look at the
restricted universal joint you mentioned. Has he a
website or any info on the internet?

David Witt has several published articles on his boats.These can be found under David Witt pedal boats in google. 
The pivoting prop is not really a universal joint and is not very well described but can be found in his article published by Human Power  44V 13n1 1997.
This can be found at BHPC.org Human Power Journals.
It is simply a slot and a pivot so that the prop can find its own vertical position. I would have thought that a 6 to 8 mm pin would be strong enough for the prop to pivot on but a collar should be used to prevent the prop falling off if the pin broke as did your u-joints.

Thanks for the film clip, great concept. I use these guys who have a large 
selection of neodymium magnets to grade 52 http://www.kjmagnetics.com/  Some 
of their smaller magnets are very lightweight and low cost and so strong 
they can't be pulled apart. Plating may be a little thin for your type of 
project, though.

If that 71 degrees is off the horizontal, seems like a long, untethered flex 
shaft could be used to correct, since it always remain at the optimum. I 
don't know the configuration of your boat, so you may have already 
considered and rejected due to your arrangement. When Greg K set his 24 hour 
distance record with an untethered shaft, it only amounted to about a 2% 
improvement compared to a skeg and inclined rigid shaft, but I don't know if 
the angle of inclination was ever as great as 71 degrees...

Hope this helps.

      I have previously been using a flex shaft but I could
never do a flat out sprint because of the shaft going
through the dead spot. The rigid shaft allows me to
go as hard as I can but the prop is not at the vertical.
I use an involute gearbox connected directly to the
shaft, this makes things simple to build and setup.
I could improve the angle but would get 11 deg max.
and involve a bit of work on the boat. 
       My prop blade starts at 20 deg off the horizontal
next to the hub and gradually increases to 55 deg at 
the tip. The prop is 400mm dia, with the prop angled
at 16 deg off the vertical the angle of the blades to
the water increases. If I make a prop with the blades
at 36 deg next to the hub and increase to 71 deg at
the tip the blade should be at the same angle as a
vertical prop. However on the other side of the prop
the angles will be way out and may cause drag on 
the prop. A four blade prop might be better in this
regard as there would be more prop blades closer
to the optimum.
        I don't have any data worked out as prop design
is a bit over my head, I use java prop for sizing.

Why a dead spot with the flex and not the rigid is what I am wondering? If 
it because of the torsional difference, then a stiffer flex shaft (CF) like 
Rick is using might be a consideration. Or perhaps a thicker but longer 
steel shaft with some flex might be a consideration, if it can bring the 
prop closer to the horizontal. Flywheels either with a heavy prop or crank 
or eliptical? sprockets might be a consideration to take up a dead spot but 
seem like a lot of trouble and introduce other issues.  A 4 blade may give 
you more flywheel effect but also not be as efficient under HP due to 
increased water friction on the blade surface, from what I have gathered. 
The 4 blade alone will not change the angle and you will still have the 
other side of even more blades not aligned to the horizontal at any one 
time,  it would seem to me.

Hope there's some ideas you can use in there, but again you may have 
considered and rejected due to cost or negative trade offs in your design.

We did some testing of the pedal thrusters I made for the sailing  
catamaran today.

Here is a video of one in operation:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/pedal_power.wmv
I was pedalling as well while videoing hence the camera movement.  We  
were able to sustain 2kts into a mild headwind.  In calm conditions  
we got to 2.3kts at sustainable power.  Sprint speed was 3kts.  Not  
very impressive speed but the boat weighs 8 tonne.

The thrusters fold up when not in use:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/folded_pedal_thruster.jpg
Each unit has two Mitrpak gearboxes.  The top box with the cranks has  
a 1:2 ratio.  The bottom box is 1:1.  Prop is 30X20 model aircraft.   
Each unit weighs 11kg.

enough?

The props were on special at Hobby City.  They were $13 each plus  
postage:
http://www.hobbycity.com/hobbycity/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=8293
They handle the thrust quite easily.  The continuous power on each  
prop translates to around 100N thrust on each.  Force gets up to  
maybe 200N but still within their capacity.

Somewhere between the 250mm and 300mm will give the lowest drag  
hull.  The wider you go the more wavemaking so you are better off  
staying on the narrow side of the lowest wetted surface.

You can do a little better with a rounded section but then the beam  
goes up unless you go longer.  For speed under 12kph the round  
section will be 1 to 2% better then the rectangular in total drag if  
the same weight but I find it possible to build the boat lighter with  
flat sections.  You also get a slight advantage from the flat bottom  
with planing forces above 14kph.

There is some fine tuning in the ends to get the best combination of  
friction resistance (wetted surface) and wave drag but what you have  
is not far off it.

Sorry, I talked about this with Alex off-list and I should have
written everyone especially so the list admins would know details.

I have tried out GoogleGroups with other projects and don't like it. I
prefer to continue with mailman.

I intend to ramp up some projects at HuPI.org over the next months. I
am planning on moving the hpv lists to hupi.org.

I am in the process of setting up a new server for HuPI.org that can
handle more traffic. It will probably be at tektonic.net which worked
well for ihpva.org/whpva.org before I backed out of that fray.

Other than the domain name changing AGAIN... (what is this the 4th
time?) sticking with mailman should make the move relatively painless.
Archives are always a problem but they can continue to live at
bikelist.org at least for now.

Thanks Moz and Bob for offering hosting space. Thanks also to the list
admins for their continued support.

If you want a good result then the starting point is to determine the  
hull drag characteristics and the engine power curve.

As an example I usually design for my sustainainable output of 120 to  
130W.  My slender stabilised monohulls have a total drag around 38N  
at a speed of 3m/s which gives me that power at the cranks.  The prop  
design process is iterative.

The best freely available prop design software is JavaProp:
http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/jp_applet.htm
You need to set the values on the options page to suit water rather  
than air.  You then select the airfoil section.  The E193 at Re# of  
100,000 is a realistic starting point.  You can enter the design  
information you have on the design page and click the design command  
button to get a design.

I use my own design software that has more flexibility than  
JavaProp.  This allows me to produce somewhat simpler designs.

All my latest props have been folding to make weed removal a matter  
of momentary coasting:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Folding_Prop.png
There is little drag when they coast so you can stop pedalling and  
keep moving.  They still have some limited reversing if you spin fast  
enough.

This design avoids welding.  The hub can be toughened nylon or other

Hi Rick,
thanks for the info.It is very helpful. I really like the folding prop and the 
boat prop system. I have built a few recumbent bikes in the past and would like 
to build a recumbent for two on water. Something not to complicated. We live in 
the Dominican Republic at present and would use it on the ocean or lakes near 
by. Things are not so easy to find here but some things can be built fairly 
cheap. Where can I find information on the drive shaft and prop system. Much 
like what you have done.? I was looking at this hydrofoil bike but thought I 
should start with something without hydrofoils and try to get the prop system 
first.

If you want a good result then the starting point is to determine the hull drag 
characteristics and the engine power curve.

As an example I usually design for my sustainainable output of 120 to 130W.? My 
slender stabilised monohulls have a total drag around 38N at a speed of 3m/s 
which gives me that power at the cranks.? The prop design process is iterative.

The best freely available prop design software is JavaProp:
http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/jp_applet.htm
You need to set the values on the options page to suit water rather than air.? 
You then select the airfoil section.? The E193 at Re# of 100,000 is a realistic 
starting point.? You can enter the design information you have on the design 
page and click the design command button to get a design.

I use my own design software that has more flexibility than JavaProp.? This 
allows me to produce somewhat simpler designs.

All my latest props have been folding to make weed removal a matter of momentary 
coasting:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Folding_Prop.png
There is little drag when they coast so you can stop pedalling and keep moving.? 
They still have some limited reversing if you spin fast enough.

This design avoids welding.? The hub can be toughened nylon or other plastic 
material rather than aluminium.? You do not need a lathe or mill to make the 
hub.? It can be done using a bench drill and decent file.? The prop pictured 
took me 4 hours.? It has efficiency of 85% at its design condition, which it is

I used to make pedal-propeller drive units.  They were quite  
successful, but perfection as a product became quite expensive.  One  
peculiarity of human power is the fluctuating torque, so that most of  
the time, the propeller is operating far from its most efficient  
rate.  The fin-based drive on the Hobie Mirage has to reverse  
direction at the end of each stroke, but this probably involves less  
friction than keeping a propeller moving at a constant speed.  If I  
were building another boat now, I would use some kind of fin drive,  
and try to design the basic unit so that it could be built and  
maintained wherever wooden boats are made, without any purchased  
hardware.  I have sketched out several possibilities of varying  
complexity, size, and efficiency.  I expect that they would be as  
fast as propeller drives, and better around shallows and weeds.

To get any advantage using hydrofoils each rider of average weight  
would need to be able to get to 250W at a miniumum.  Most people can  
only get this power for very short periods.  If you could produce  
this power level then the design speed would be something over  
14kph.  You can get lift off using bigger foils at lower speed and  
less power but what is the point when you could go faster with less  
power and much less complexity in displacement mode!

Hydrofoils increase the susceptibility to fouling with weeds and  
other litter.  They also require considerably greater draft such that  
beach launchings becomes a wet affair.

A key step is to decide what you intend to do with the boat.  If it  
is purely sprinting then hydrofoils would be worth consideration.  If  
you want to do longer distance cruising (anything over 5km at a time)  
then hydrofoils would not be in the mix unless you are a trained  
athlete.

An important element in the design is to establish the power output  
of the engines.  If you do not have this from bike data then it can  
be determined in a gym on a recumbent cycling machine.  You will then  
have a better idea of the possibilities.

Setting up any pedal boat for two people involves more complexity  
than a single person drive.  The best configuration from a hull  
efficiency point of view is the stabilised monohull or possibly a  
monohull without stabilisers with a single drive shaft.  Setting up  
the mechanical system to get the two cranks to drive the common shaft  
is a challenge.

I personally think two boats would be better than one but with two  
people in a single boat you will be able to go a bit faster.  The  
problem is you will most likely need two people all the time because  
the weight of the boat will be greater than a single person can  
manage.  Also performance with one person will be down on what could  
be achieved with a single person in a boat specifically designed for  
the person.

I am currently making my own 1:4 gearboxes.  The first of them are on  
the boat I made for my sister seen here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fBLi40q4pU
The box is painted yellow so it is easy to see in the clip.  The  
parts for this box cost a little over AUD300 including the cranks and  
pedals.  It weighs 2.8kg.  I have now made a second one with more  
expensive gear set that weighs 2.3kg.

The selection of the prop shaft is quite important.  If you use high  
aspect props to get the efficiency then they need to be run in line  
with water flow to avoid vibration.  I use mostly spring steel or  
machinable aluminium or a combination of these in a curved  
arrangement.  I have a yet to be tested shaft made from carbon fibre  
and wound to my specification to get high torsional stiffness but  
compliant in bending.

I have tested most possibilities over the years and can give you a  
reasonable idea of the weaknesses or advantages of any set up.  More  
importantly I can determine the performance you can expect in  
whatever configuration you come up with providing you know the weight  
of the engines, what you want to carry and the output of the  
engines.  This can save a lot of trial and error with the associated  
cost and time.  I provide free design for non-commercial applications.

I'm mostly a reader, but just had to respond to this one.  The fin vs prop 
comparison has been well done and the efficiency of the Hobie flippers is 
really pretty awful - nowhere even close to a human driven prop.

Unless you anticipate tripling the efficiency of the flippers you are 
destined to repeat the past...

Hi Bob,

I'm confident that  Rick is right on top of propellor-stuff, but I'd 
like to hear more about your fin-drive ideas.

Max efficiency is less of an issue when "messing about " is the goal, 
and freedom from weed-wrapped props with the convenience of a kick-up 
drive, combined with the fish-like grace of a flexible fin appeals to 
me.

I wouldn't mind resorting to a paddle for the occasional reverse 
requirement.

I liked the relative simplicity of Harry Bryan's rig, as opposed to the 
bulkier drive that was later developed and discussed for awhile on this 
list. Seems I remember some sort of transparent flex fin on Harry's 
early experiment. I like the esthetics. ;-)

Harry ultimately used a forward fin(skeg) to counter yaw effects, ...I 
was wondering if you had any other ideas on yaw control.

I was wondering whether a split fin with stacked halves in opposed 
motion  would be feasible, or would turbulence between the flow between 
the fin-halves interfere too much to be useful? (Picture a swim-finned 
diver swimming on his side)

I would value any comments you might make (Others' opinions welcome 
too.)

Thought it well to post the results of the definitive HPB study of Hobie 
breakdown prone flipper system.  However successful the marketing concept 
the results were dismal.  I quote:

"At 3.5 mph the Mirage drive was only 22% efficient (heart rate 107). The 
drive doesn't really get efficient until it reaches 5.3 mph at 46% (heart 
rate 132). Now when you realize that many prop driven HPB's approach 
efficiencies are closer to 70-80% efficient, it's no wonder that in fair, 
head to flipper competitions the Hobie sucks hind teat."

Rick has designed some systems on flexible drives that are easily raised, or 
reversed in cases of heavy weed.  Keep in mind that flipper drives are not 
immune to the same issues.  I am a lifelong kayaker and I can assure you 
that weed is rarely an issue, unless you are in extremely shallow water, 
when neither system is practical.  Try "flipping" in 1 foot of water.  In 
these cases a flex drive prop system can be created that is easily and 
temporarily lifted out of the water.  Compare to the Hobie flipper system. 
which is a trial to remove and replace.

To me anyway, and even under the best of conditions, props are so much more 
efficient, simpler and far less subject to breakdown.  Chasing the flipper 
concept is like trying to replicate sharkskin or whale fin tubercles. 
Nature simply does these better.

But have fun... but if Hobie couldn't do it...

Hello people!

Very interesting discussion here!
I'm brand new on this blog but I'm currently working on a pedal + propeller 
moved small wet submarine and have a couple of remarks/suggestions on this 
topic :
Good remark about variable torque (and RPM) when pedaling for actuating the 
propeller. Some inventors designed solutions to improve this : an "ovale" 
leading gear to compensate legs dead stroke and make the motion more regular 
and with a better efficiency already proven on traditional racing bikes (+10 
to +20% depending on promoted solutions : See http://osymetric.com)
An other way to damp this RPM variation is to adapt a rotation speed 
regulator and increase the angular inertia (it's mechanically very simple 
and cheap to implement). Only drawback : It's increasing a bit the overall 
weight and required some extra torque and time to speed up when starting 
motion.

Other question : I'm looking for a CFD software (such as Fluent+Gambit from 
Ansys or Flow-3D) else than the opensource ones, free but not always easy to 
use. Has anyone a clue about how to get an efficient and pro class one 
without spending a fortune (or downloading cracked, uncomplete, and of high 
risk of malware infection)?

Thanks

Hello Jimbo,

Boating in internet waters is fraught with the icebergs of 
misunderstandings, misperceptions, and misinterpretations. To attempt 
to dodge a few of these mis'es, let me state that my own interest in 
the fin drive discussion is almost completely curiosity-driven 
(sometimes a very inefficient drive-system itself ;-). I have no 
"dog-in-the-fight", particularly not the Mirage system, which has never 
appealed to me. Hobie or not, I don't accept that their drive is the 
be-all, end-all of fin systems. Of the systems I am aware of, only the 
Harry Bryan fin I mentioned caught my fancy at all, and I considered 
the yaw issue the greatest drawback, which was an entirely subjective 
objection on my part. It seemed to be a fly in the soup of what was 
otherwise the simple fish tail on-a-boat concept that intrigued me. 
Thus my question about a possibly yaw-balancing "split-fin drive"  ( no 
comments yet on this).

As regards the Bryan fin-system, specifically, I would submit that it 
is hardly more complex or subject to breakage than a prop system. (IF 
comparing them was the topic - see next to last sentence below)

As  tongue-in-cheek observation, I note that the Hobie effort , while 
solving the yaw issue, seems to me a fish trying to swim with its 
ventral fins as the main propulsors, rather than the tail. Other fish, 
smarter, I think, have chosen the tail as a better way to go.

I have watched Parker McReady on his Preposterous Pogofoil,  one of the 
earliest whale-tail creations and the horizontal fluke drive, at least 
in his hydrofoiling configuration,  was definitely a high-effort 
short-term proposition. Nothing relaxed about it.  Same goes for 
similar-but-simpler hydrofoil jumping-jack drive craft recently 
marketed (name escapes me at the moment.) Any horizontal fin "fluke" 
drive, introduces "vertical yaw"(pitching) which hurts efficiency also, 
of course.

Harry Bryan's simple displacement hull with a swish-tail fin flexing 
gracefully behind the boat much better suits my fantasy concept of a 
fin-craft for easy-does-it messing about. (Another marketing attempt, 
the Pacific Tail-fin, seems to have stalled, - the latest web-site 
update is dated 2006, I think. This is the "more bulky" unit I first 
mentioned, when compared with Harry's rig. Yaw is also evident in the 
site's videos.)

For elegant simplicity in a prop drive, Bob Stuart's drop-in Spin-Fin, 
which I have tried in his own kayak, very much impressed me, and if 
production/marketing considerations had been favorable enough that Bob 
had chosen to continue pursuing its development, I believe it would 
have become very popular. (More so than the larger Sea-Cycle units, 
IMO.)

(Relatively) recent progress in design and experimentation with 
flex-shaft propellor units, as exemplified by Rick's successes, with 
some collaboration by one or more others, I believe,  seem to me to 
represent the state of the prop-drive art at present, along with the 
interesting recent attempts at hp folding props. I also think the 
"kissing outrigger" stabilized monohull, again highly developed by 
Rick, Bob and others, has been adequately demonstrated to be the way to 
go for displacement speed.

In any case, I make no case for a fin's efficiency compared with a 
prop. Apples and oranges, I believe.  The trophy for ultimate speed, 
which I suppose is the highest measure of hp "efficiency" as we seem to 
be measuring things, seems still to be held by an air-prop driven 
hydrofoil (Decavitator) unless I am too far behind the times.

But the maximum-speed efficiency machines are not what I, at 70, am 
interested in spending my time on. Thus my intent in pursuing "fin 
discussion" is not to compare/compete with prop drives, but to explore 
fins as a separate subject.

I am slowing down, but still enjoy reading about and watching the 
experiments and progress achieved by all the human-power group, 
whatever their goals.  So I add my encouragements to all, whatever 
envelope they may be pushing. ;-)

Best wishes,

Larry

Thanks for the data on the Hobie drive.  I wouldn't have bothered  
thinking about fin drives if I had not seen a lot of room for  
improvement in all previous systems.

Starting from the fin, the usual scheme has been a rigid leading  
edge, with a flexible wing.  This gives a shape like an airplane wing  
flying upside down.  The first level of improvement is a rigid,  
symmetrical foil, as on an aerobatic aircraft, with a pivot that lets  
it automatically flip over to the best angle of attack for each  
stroke.  This pivot can have a second degree of freedom under manual  
control that lets it be set for reverse thrust.  For greater   
efficiency, we can use two wing spars, fore and aft, so that a  
flexible fin assumes nearly the ideal camber for each direction.

Next, the fins should be placed so that there is no yaw imposed on  
the boat.  The Hobie is fine in this respect, whereas Harry Bryan's  
boat was getting thrust from all three fins as it wiggled through the  
water.  Two fins off the stern with opposite motions are one  
solution, but I prefer having a compact arrangement, with the fins  
nearer the pedals.  Three options are: a single fin, with the side   
force reacted against the mass and shapes of a multihull, two opposed  
fins mounted like bilge keels or leeboards, or fins on the tips of  
sweeps, like oars on their way to being parked on the gunwales.
The single fin can be mechanically simple, with force in each  
direction coming from one pedal.  The bilge-keel mounting emulates  
the pectoral fins of whales and penguins, and avoids disturbing the  
surface of the water.  The leeboard style avoids a through-hull  
fitting and gives a longer sweep, but makes waves of it's own.  It  
might achieve a constructive interference with the hull, giving a bit  
of jet propulsion and suction at the hull end of the stroke.  Only  
the sweep mounting gives a really decent angle of attack, applying  
most of its force in the proper direction.  My propeller tips could  
move over 15' per pedal stroke (half rotation of cranks.)  However,  
sweeps need compliance and surface-followers to keep the fin working  
properly on most boats and sea conditions, and rigid parts to  
minimize hysteresis  losses.  They probably need an extra link to  
maintain a parallelogram to keep the fin angle accurate.  They might  
also want a compact-operation mode for use within a marina where oars  
are a clearance problem.

The single-fin type requires a separate rudder, but the others are  
able to handle steering duties.  The leeboard style would allow  
course corrections, or errors, depending on the listing of a single  
hull.  The double fin types, with reversing switches, would allow the  
boat to turn with no forward motion.  Various degrees of adjustment  
could be applied for course keeping, saving the drag of a rudder.   
Ideally, steering could be done by either varying the force on each  
leg, or, preferably, by touching the reversing switch or trim  
adjustment with the sides of the heels.

In shallow water, the fins could drag on the ground and still work,  
and when surfing onto a beach, they would dig in and resist the  
retreating wave.  They could also just swing back to shed weed if any  
drag built up.

One great advantage of pedal cranks is that they conserve momentum.   
Linear drives often waste energy by requiring muscle power for  
deceleration, like shadow boxing.  I have not tried it yet, but a  
system like the Hobie drive, but with the pivot at the top might work  
well, like a pendulum.  If the natural frequency works out to the  
right range, it could be a sweet deal, combining easily with the  
sweep or leeboard schemes for a neat, drop-in installation.  The mass  
of the whole system would affect the frequency.  It could probably  
benefit from springs for adjustment to different speeds or leg weights.

There are quite a few right angle gearbox manufactures.

You can use smaller boxes with 1:1 ratio and bicycle chain speed  
increase on the input.  Mitrpay range is probably the best value around:
http://www.mitrpak.com/product_results.php

Marcoplo boats are offering a modified Mitrpak box that accepts cranks:

http://marcopoloboats.com/MitrpakDrive.html

This box has a 1:2 ratio that is a bit low for a fast boat.  I prefer  
a minimum of 1:4.

You can purchase nice gearsets from this place:

http://www.qtcgears.com/RFQ/BevelGears.htm



I have used two Mitrpak boxes to make complete drive legs for a few  
applications now.  These are really nice but also end up expensive  
per the unit pictured here:

http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/folded_pedal_thruster.jpg

These units use a modified T-122 for the top box that accepts cranks  
and a standard R-101 on the bottom.  This gives an overall ratio of  
1:2, which is ideal for swinging the 30X20 prop with two units  
pushing the 8t sailing catamaran.

You can get 1:4 ratio using two of the Mitrpak boxes as seen here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXSZLt_6eFg&feature=related

You need to get to 6 minutes in before you see the top box.  The  
bottom box and prop are partially visible in the shots on the trailer  
at the beginning.

There are other ways to get the right angle drive including twisted  
chain, twisted belts, flexible shaft and magnets. Each method has  
pros and cons.

re you question:
Other question : I'm looking for a CFD software (such as Fluent

I had a look at your sub.  I expect that you could get performance  
gains simply by working to minimise wetted surface and enclosed  
volume.  You can calculate the drag reasonably accurately for  
operating in deep water by using the ITTC57 skin friction line:
Cf = 0.075/(log10 (Re#)-2)2

The drag can then be approximated to:

Rv=1/2*rho*U2*S*Cf

Where U is speed and S is surface area both in compatible units with  
rho.

You need to do these calculation for the entire wetted surface  
including the fins and the prop protectors.  Each fin and protector  
should be treated as separate for determining its Re#. Remember to  
allow for both sides.

Further comments:
1. This simple analysis excludes form factors, which will be low  
unless you have some abrupt transition in section.  The optimum  
fineness ratio for water is around 8 but the main aim is to keep the  
volume and overall surface area as small as possible while having the  
room to operate.  Fineness of less than 4 would start to make form  
more significant.
2. If you are near the surface then there will be waves.  There is  
freely available thin ship software called Michlet that gives  
accurate wave data fore fineness down to around 5.  Michlet will also  
calculate the skin friction based on the ITTC line.
3. The ITTC friction calculation assumes turbulent flow over the  
surface. There are so-called laminar flow hulls that give favourable  
pressure profiles to maintain laminar flow but I doubt whether they  
can achieve this in a hull disturb by pedalling.  Some info on that  
here:
http://www.iag.uni-stuttgart.de/luftfahrzeugaerodynamik/paper/ 
melbourne_9_98_lutz.pdf

One area where you might gain efficiencies is to consider less  
turbulent methods of power input than cycling. I have done  
biomechanical modelling of swing arm system in air compared with  
cycling.  In the harmonic regime, up to moderate power, it is more  
efficient than cycling.  I tested that system on the boat seen here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYoW3XjHRbw
It is not suited to energetic power level and the harmonics are  
probably less beneficial when the legs are buoyant but it still  
offers lower velocity of the moving parts - predominantly legs.

I expect you would get reasonable drag results for your existing sub  
using this approach.

You should find there are more efficient ways to adjust pitch and  
roll using moveable ballast (or air) at low speed and fins for higher  
speed rather than the twin side thrusters.

Hello Rick,

Thank you for your recommandations and advices. Actually my CFD quest is not 
only for the submarine drag reduction and estimation aims but for more 
general questions such as sizing of the tail and interaction with hull and 
transcient analysis when pitching, yawling and rolling.

Your point about efficiency with an arm swinging system for propulsion is 
interesting but looking at the video on your weblink it seems that you are 
pedaling (with high speed results!) or did I miss something? Could you be 
more specific about this system please?

Thank you.

You can get good results for foil modelling using JavaFoil or Xfoil.   
I prefer JavaFoil because it has friendlier front end:
http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/jf_applet.htm
It is a 2-D analysis but it has corrections in the options page for  
the foil aspect ratio.  It gives good results for a wide range of  
sections that can be selected and modified if required.  You can  
simply add the drag components of each element.  You might get  
different results with full 3D CFD analysis but you could not rely on  
them anyhow.

For a foil mounted of a large flattish surface double the selected  
aspect to allow for the end plane.

The high velocity body element with pedalling is the feet.  If they  
are moving in a high density fluid such as water then there is a lot  
of wasted energy in stirring the water with the motion of the feet.  
With the swing arm system the power stroke is more effective.  The  
force is in line with the movement of the power stroke of each foot.   
For example if the thrust is applied in a horizontal direction then  
the feet mostly move back and forth horizontally with a small  
vertical lift at either end.  With a crank the feet travel both  
vertically and horizontally at the same velocity.  In a recumbent  
position the vertical component of the motion does not delivery much  
force to the cranks - per your observation for the elliptical  
cranks.  Hence the feet travel at high velocity for 4 quadrants of  
the cycle with roughly only 1 quadrant being effective power delivery  
or 75% of feet spinning energy just to make the next power stroke.   
With a swing arm system it is closer to 50% of feet moving energy to  
make the next power stroke.

In air there is the benefit of the harmonic motion if the swing arms  
are set up right so there is negligible cost in the reversal.  That  
may be more evident in this clip courtesy of now departed colleague  
Warren Loomis:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Warren_HC.wmv
The reason I played around with this drive system on my V12 boat was  
to lower the centre of gravity of the engine such that it was  
compatible with unstabilised slender hull.  I have also contemplated  
its use on a faired trike for endurance record setting because it  
requires less volume than cranks and chainrings commonly used - hence  
lower wind resistance.  It is a compact arrangement for delivering  
power that still permits the HUFF configuration.   I have seen other  
configurations that try to reduce frontal area but they look  
incredibly awkward to operate.

Greetings --

This mailing list "hpv-boats at bikelist.org" is moving to "hpv-boats at hupi.org".

The move will probably commence on Monday or Tuesday, depending on how
busy we are. When Alex (at bikelist.org) is ready, he will turn off
the list at bikelist.org so no new messages will be accepted there
(this includes commands such as subscribe/unsubscribe requests). Alex
will then send the list data to me and I will install it and
reactivate the list at hupi.org.

We're using the same software at both servers so in theory this should
be a simple move.

You don't have to do anything -- except start using the new address
after the move.
I will send another message when the list is running at hupi.org.

Terrific overview, Bob, ... thanks for taking the time!

Plenty of food for thought.

As a side observation (OT), your reference to "sea conditions" brought 
to mind a similar issue with one of my FrontRower rigs, where the 
changing freeboard with lighter/heavier loadings, and the varying 
surface height with chop, dictated differering "settings" of the 
mechanism, to insure proper oar-blade immersion. ( I built an 
adjustment feature which helps with the freeboard issue, ...somewhat 
less helpful with chop, but helps a bit.)

Your idea re. multihull yaw resistance interests me. Considering the 
added advantage of inherent stability(no outrigger drag at any speed or 
degree of list), and the overall desirability of a single fin's 
simplicity, do you believe that the lateral resistance of two hulls 
would effectively reduce the overall drag, yaw plus hulls, enough to 
equal-or-better that of a monohull with yaw-countering and stabilizing 
appendages? I envision hulls each optimized for its half of the total 
displacement at expected speeds, and an overall beam dictated by 
Godzilla(etc.) for minimum intra-hull wave interference.) My weight 
hovers around 200 pounds these days, so I generally think in terms of 
about 325-350 for all-up weight of a "pleasure" craft with lunch, 
camera, etc.)

I took pleasure in watching the relatively slow-turning 18" prop as Jon 
Knapp's Sea Saber moved away from the dock, which of course the rider 
could not see. There seemed to be a somewhat magical amount of forward 
motion from the prop activity.  I had a similar impression while 
watching the (8 ft.?) air prop on the (Steve Ball's?)Dragonfly 
hovercraft at (14-15mph? IHPVA Championships - Visalia Ca.) speed. I 
imagine similar pleasure from watching the fin working between the cat 
hulls, in this case perhaps visible to the rider, in a configuration 
which placed the fin closer beneath the pedals, minimizing linkages, 
etc.

Maybe a "Feathercraft" type kayak  drop-rudder(s) to assist turns, but 
raised for straight runs, minimizing appendage drag?

Jimbo,
Could you link-to or reference the source from which you took the quote 
re. Hobie efficiency? (i.e., the "definitive study")
Thanks.

Hi Larry,

I'd have to get serious about the math to work out the relative  
efficiency of hulls vs fins at resisting the side force of a single  
fin drive.  At least, having it in between the center of resistance  
and center of gravity lengthwise should keep yaw to a minimum,  
although there would be some sideways wiggling.  Hobie-cat style V  
bottoms would do much better than minimum-resistance round bottoms,  
too.  With round bottoms, a foil-shaped skeg would take much of the  
load, and add a bit of thrust itself. The skeg might be all the way  
forward, to balance the side force provided by the rudder.

The Sea Saber was my first good HPB ride, and it did feel like magic  
once I centered the rudder.  High pitch numbers give a magic  
appearance, too, but they do add a lot more invisible spin to the  
wake than is ideal.  OTOH, they waste less power at the low-torque  
parts of the pedal cycle.

My recall was that the Dragonflier had a 10' prop, but I'd have to  
check.

There are two general approaches to the whole efficiency debate.  One  
is the sailor's definition of "A Race"- two boats within sight on  
approximately the same heading.  The other is from my friend Gary  
Marshall, regarding our kayaks - "But Bob, once I'm on the water, I'm  
THERE!"  That didn't stop him from spending weeks inventing a new  
rudder style, though.  Boats are what sculptors do to avoid art dealers.

Mark,

Marco Polo Boats has both a Mitrpak right angle gear box at a 1:2 increaser ratio made specifically for HPB, as well as a very flexible cable shaft that can bend 90 degrees over its length. Photos of the Mitrpak are on our website, and write if you would like photos of the cable shaft.

In addition, we are working on a redesign of our PlanetDrive with a 1:4 increaser ratio and 300 in-lbs of torque rating. The PlanetDrive will now be directly attached to Mitrpak drive for a total of 1:8 increaser ratio.

Rick Willoughby has tried the flex cable drive, and found it fine until 11 kph, at which point it kicks back, but we are working on a solution to that. The cable shafts are not yet on the website (marcopoloboats.com), but they are 316 Stainless Steel and two meters long. The cost is $225 delivered in the U.S. Figure about another $50 for delivery outside of the U.S.

We will be working on website updates this week, but if you want more information, please contact us directly.

Thanks,

Mark Vermilion
Marco Polo Boats, Inc.

Message-ID: <4E56F5B7-8C23-400D-9E4B-7D0817A2D5C2@bigpond.net.au>

A while ago I decided to do a dynamic model of the crank drive and  
curved shaft system for a pedal boat.  This was so I could determine  
how a drive would feel before it was made rather than doing it by  
trial and error.

The model is able to produce time based data on the important  
parameters of a drive system.

This trace shows what my current 8mm curved shaft does with a 1:4  
ratio on V14 hull:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to4%20_solid.pdf
 From a feel perspective the black curve is the most important.  The  
closer it is to a straight line the better.  At 3m/s average boat  
speed the crank speed is varying between 60 and 80 rpm.

This is the trace with Mark's flex shaft:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to4%20_flex.pdf
For the average boat speed of 3m/s the crank speed is going from  
slight reversal up to 140rpm.  With 170mm cranks 140rpm corresponds  
with my maximum foot velocity so that was my speed limit with the  
flex shaft.  I have video that shows the stop-start nature of the  
pedaling so the model is reasonably close to reality.

I have also modeled what the flex shaft would be like with a 1:8  
ratio driving a 12X12 prop:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to8%20_flex.pdf
Here the crank speed variation is from 40rpm to 120rpm.  This would  
feel tolerable and I could get slightly faster than 3m/s before  
hitting my 140rpm limit.

So with higher gear ratio the flex shaft system looks to be an  
economic means of getting a right angle drive and mounting the prop  
within reach beside the hull.

Also with practice at spinning, the crank speed would be smoother.   
Even with the 1:4 ratio I could hold quite steady foot speed with the  
flex shaft up to about 8kph. I do not have enough training to "spin"  
as I load up.

The dynamics depends on the boat and prop as well as the shaft and  
gear ratio.  If anyone wants a shaft system modeled in this way it  
does not take long to do.

Thanks Rick
your report is highly informative and seems very accurate, as usual.
I'm just wondering about Mark Drela's flex shaft propulsion system, the one
he donated to The Open Waterbike Project

http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system

<http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system>The
shaft is olid but pretty thin (just 3 mm !); nonetheless he says it was
builit and worked very well.
Do your calculations confirm this?

As you know I believe the availability of a commercial flex-shaft propulsion
system could be the turning point in marketable high performance pedal
boats, so I'm really looking foward to this!

shaft is olid but pretty thin (just 3 mm !); nonetheless he says it was
builit and worked very well.
Do your calculations confirm this?

If they could have achieved the design performance in terms of drag  
then the 3mm shaft would be OK spinning at higher cadence than I am  
capable of now.

The biomechanical efficiency drops off above 300W with a 300mm pitch  
prop at 6m/s.  It is a slippery slope when drag is higher than design  
and would require a trained "spinner" to overcome the inherent losses  
of a compliant shaft.

I expect if they had taken the design further they would have  
increased the shaft diameter once they understood the problem.  From  
the videos I have seen of Skeeter in operation the pilot seems to be  
delivering a great deal more than the target 250W to get it to fly.   
Hence I would question the comment "worked very well".  My  
understanding is that it performed well short of design objective.

There are other ways to improve the efficiency such as more rotating  
inertia on the driving end of the shaft to provide carry through the  
dead spot.

The biomechanical efficiency is not an illusion.  I can drop my heart  
rate from say 140bpm to 137bpm for the same boat speed by  
concentrating on spinning rather than just pushing the pedals.  The  
problem for me  is it involves untrained muscles that tire quicker  
than the better trained ones. And this is using drive system with  
little compliance.  The benefit of spinning is even greater with a  
compliant shaft.  Spinning is about 10% more efficient than push-push  
on any crank drive.

Have just got one of Rick's folding props with shaft.
The shaft is 16mm aluminium solid rod 2m long,
and the flex section is 9mm epoxy reinforced flexible
steel rod. Had the idea if a flexible shaft can go up
and down to avoid snags why not move it side to side
to steer the boat. Tried it out this week and works well,
turns better than with the rudder I had. The shaft is at
an angle of 11deg so curve is quite shallow, even so
needs a bit of leverage to turn it. Have put a post in
the boat design website with some pics and a video.

I haven't been active on this list for years but recently got mixed up in an
effort to build a boat that will go around the world autonomously.

I remember figures on human wattage from this list along with other useful
numbers.  Can anyone recall the average sustained wattage and peak wattage
for a human?

http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system

<http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system
>The
shaft is olid but pretty thin (just 3 mm !); nonetheless he says it was
builit and worked very well.
Do your calculations confirm this?

As you know I believe the availability of a commercial flex-shaft propulsion
system could be the turning point in marketable high performance pedal
boats, so I'm really looking foward to this!

Thanks!


Its looks likes like 120wats is a sustainable figure.
  
Now I will attempt to convert meters/seconds to kilometers/hour to miles per
hour.  Yes I'm working with the unfortunate American scale.


The figure I'm most interested in is 

speed/watts sustained 

speed/watts in a sprint 


with a mono-hull design.

Don't know what you mean by autonomously, is it large enough for living 
quarters like the old microship projects.

Here's some old links that might be interesting along the same lines:

http://microship.com/microship/index.html

http://www.prophish.com/nyrio.html

Hope this helps.
