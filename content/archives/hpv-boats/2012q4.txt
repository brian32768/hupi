Subject: [hpv-boats] Echuca Mini
Message-ID: <14D23CE5-FC38-4FE2-A9F1-725988D32C2A@bigpond.net.au>

I went up to Echuca for the Murray Mini on the weekend.  It is a 50km  
race that covers about 2/3 of Day 3 in the full Marathon.  It was a  
good opportunity for Peter Heal to try V15-6m as he is contemplating  
doing the full race at the end of the year.

In 2010 Pete set the unassisted round Australia cycling record  
covering 15,000km in 49 days - meaning he is a fair cyclist and a  
specialist with recumbents.

I set up his boat as well as I could from measurements and data he  
provided.  He found the settings OK but the gearing was heavier than  
he preferred.  I selected my stainless steel folding from V14 prop  
for him on a 1/4" spring steel shaft.  This has done two MMs so I  
know it can take the bumps.  However prop pitch is 620mm so there is  
a good deal of compliance with the 1/4" inch shaft.  RMS power is  
about 5% higher than average due to torsional compliance.   I used  
one of the folding CF props - it only had one small knock in the race  
and is unscathed.

There were 33 boats in the Mini.  Some were in relays but majority  
were single or doubles.  There were two OC6s.  Pete's official  
average was 13.8km.  Mine was 11.2kph.  Current assist averaged  
around 1.8kph.  I have only started getting fit for the MM.  Also the  
seat cushion on V15-58 also caused me some aggravation.

The link to the old records is dead at present but I think Pete's  
average would be at record pace for unrestricted over 50yo in the  
full Marathon - his speed would go up to 16kph on handicap.  The full  
marathon is a handicap event with age allowance and boat allowance  
although unrestricted boat class has a time penalty against the K1s.   
Last weekend there were only two single paddlers faster than Pete but  
they are 30 years younger.

I have posted a photo showing the two boats in the starting area:

On Sunday there was a short race up and down river at Echuca - Steam  
v Sweat; where we raced a paddle steamer on the downriver leg from  
the start.  There were also runners on the shore.  This was the first  
year boats were involved and it was good fun.  Pete beat the paddle  
steamer to the turning buoy.  I rode its wake till we had to turn to  
come back upriver - speed drop of 3 to 4kph over the ground when  
pushing against the current. Results for the 8km race here:

Pete did have his "Spot" on the boat for the mini but updates are too  
slow to be of any use with the amount of meandering but gives general  
direction:

Subject: [hpv-boats] Low Weight Hull
Message-ID: <3864BF65-A997-4BD4-9B3F-2F8192AA6527@bigpond.net.au>

The first boat of my V16 pedal boat design variant is being built in  
Maine, USA.

As well as being the first V16 hull that uses the 32 parameter  
Michlet shape function for optimisation, it is also the first to be  
built in a female mould.

The mould was made from low cost melamine coated particle board using  
a slightly curved board for the bottom and two boards flared up from  
the bottom to form the sides.  The mould is simple to make as it  
comprises just three flat panels with stiffeners.

The shape is drag minimised for 120kg total displacement with a  
heayweight pilot and sustainable power output of 120W resulting in a  
hull length of 6.4m.

The shell made in the mould using glass/foam/epoxy composite and  
vacuum bagged during cure weighs 6kg and is near perfect finish over  
most of the area:

The finished hull with bulkheads and deck panels should be under 10kg.

Wow, good news, Rick!
Congratulations, the flock is g Bosch ? warum nicht? 
Vielleicht will einer der Boschler aufs Land ziehen?rowing.
I might have worked on the female mold where the three boards meet by
applying some 
resin on the joints.
10 kg - really means an ultralight hull.

Cheers Clemens
