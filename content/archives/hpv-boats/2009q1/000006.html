<PRE>Hi Everybody,

This is to let you know that we are in the process of developing a new pedal
boat to go with our Escapade and Encore (the Sprite is now out of production
but this new boat may also be called Sprite).

This boat will also be a &quot;cruising&quot; boat - as are our others - rather than
&quot;performance&quot; as many of you focus on.

In philosophical size it will fall between the Escapade and Encore, but will
actually be shorter than the Escapade at 11 feet long.  It will be a two
person boat, sitting side by side, with a 4 foot beam.

The big difference is that the drive system(s)will be a composite, drop in,
swing down/up type rather than the built-in system of our other boats.  The
main reason for doing this so we can have a boat that can be packaged and
shipped reasonably.  (An Encore can cost $1000 or more to ship in today's
freight market, and this doesn't work for a $3500 product.)

This boat will be rotomolded as are our others.  It was designed by Tom
Parker of Parker Designs (who also did the original Sprite and Encore).  The
mold is now being built and should be in our plant in a month or so.
Development of it is expected to take most of the season but hopefully will
become production worthy later on in the summer.

Best Wishes to everyone.

Curt Chambers

It is odd that the oceanographers and biologists are getting so excited
about this trip.  They learned a tremendous amount from the Kon-Tiki and Ra
voyages, close to the surface of the water, but didn't repeat them.  They
could easily equip a sailboat with a bulb keel for continuous observation of
the type this sub affords.  People just don't buy glass-bottom boats, or
even simple through-surface viewers.

Best,
Bob Stuart

selling them.
