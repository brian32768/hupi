<PRE>Rick,
?
Can't you pedal backwards to rmove the weeds &amp; leaves?
?
Neal

Pedaling backwards is never reliable.  It will normally remove leaves  
but not long marine weed.  Also it means you have to go in reverse to  
reverse the flow.  By lifting the prop clear of the water I can  
maintain some speed in coast and I am guaranteed the weed is clear.   
You have to be able to see the prop to make sure it is clean.   
Actually removing the weed by hand is the fastest way.  Weed is a  
serious issue for a pedal boat compared with a paddles boat.

If you are pushing hard for a long period with variable wind with  
variable current it is hard to get the required inputs to know the  
prop is fouled. It s very depressing if you get around to inspecting  
the prop and find it fouled.  You know you have wasted energy and  
that is the last thing you want to know in an endurance event.  I had  
a practice of checking the prop at least every hour and if there was  
a lot of weed I would do it more often.

If you are pacing with another boat of very similar ability it is  
possible to detect something on the prop as you find heart rate is  
building but still just pacing.  If there is variable head wind then  
this does not work because the paddler loses more speed than I do.
