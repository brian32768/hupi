Greetings All,

 

It's time for me to do a little research on propellers and such.  I was
looking at Rich W's. boat here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_Dec_2008.jpg   and I noticed a
wide and steeply pitched prop.  I'm sure that this is a very efficient
setup, so are there plans/drawings for this prop?  How wide is it, and at
what pitch?  Are there props for sale?  If I have to make my own, what
materials would I use, wood, fiberglass, or...?

 

On a related thread what rpms do these generally run at, and what cadence is
typical for the pedaling?  

 

Thanks a lot,

Ken

I have been travelling.  I did email directly but not sure if you got  
it.

The best prop is designed to suit the application.  You need to know  
what power you can produce and what speed you will achieve with that  
power. If you have a hull in mind then the speed v power can be  
worked out.  The best way to determine your power output is to do a  
test on a recumbent machine at a gym.

Typical value of cadence is 70rpm and prop speed is 300rpm.  The  
300rpm works well for a suitable prop.

JavaProp is quite good for designing a prop.  You need to set the  
Options to suit water and select a suitable foil.  You need to select  
a foil.  The E193 at Re# 100,000 and 1 degree AoA is OK.   The design  
process is iterative.  You need to achieve adequate strength while  
aiming for the highest efficiency.

If you can weld then the easiest way to make a nice prop is to use  
stainless steel flat bar.  I have a procedure for this.

The Bolly boat prop is OK for an easily driven hull.  Will not be as  
good as you can make to suit but still good for most applications.

Subject: [hpv-boats] Folding Prop
Message-ID: <B33D321F-AD5D-436C-B9DB-EB79AD24665C@bigpond.net.au>

I finally got around to making a folding prop that was suggested  
earlier in the year.  I tested it on Saturday.  Seems to perform as  
well as my best rigid prop.  It is nice to be able to stop pedalling  
and coast.  If I sense weed on the prop then coasting allows the weed  
to flow off the blades.

A small amount of weed collected on the strut but this can be easily  
reached to remove.  Most weed is channelled down the shaft to the  
prop.  Being able to clear it by coasting is far more effective then  
untangling it by hand while stopped.

I have placed a photos showing the folded and unfolded positions.  If  
only one blade folds it will go almost in line with the shaft.  When  
both fold they stop against each other in the position in the photo.

Hi Rick

Great prop.

I thought that you did not use a strut but let the shaft flex and find its 
own position.

On the hinge pins are these riveted in or do you use a form of socket cap 
screw.

Do you think the slots for the blade to fold  generate any drag.

Hi Rick

I have used props strutless but it is not practical for everyday  
use.  The prop hangs when the boat is carried.  The prop will  
sometimes hit the hull in a turn if there are waves.  The prop dives  
when you go in reverse.  I use a light tension strut that can be  
folded sideways to inspect the prop or to enable the boat to be set  
evenly on the beach.  Is costs about 2W.


I used a 6mm partially threaded bolt for the prop pivot.  The hole on  
one side of the blade is threaded and the other is a neat 6mm.  I  
bolted the blades firmly in place with bolt thread and head both  
exposed. I then cut these exposed bits and filed them flush with the  
curve of the hub.  It will not be easy to remove the blades.  I would  
need to mill or drill out the bolts first.

The slot behind the blades will offer no measurable drag.

I continue to be impressed with the prop.  I am still to get some  
calm weather for best comparison but comparing with data from the  
last couple years it seems my average speed is a little higher.   
There are three things that are contributing.  The boat is lighter  
and optmised for 11kph rather than 12kph so less wetted surface.  I  
do not need to stop forward progress to clean the prop of weed and am  
able to do this as soon as I suspect extra drag.  I am currently  
running a higher gear ratio, which improves biomechanical efficiency  
however is tough on the legs on windy days.  Not sure if I will stay  
with this ratio.

I did 25km on Saturday with wind to 50kph at an average of 9.0kph.  
The previous best in these heavy conditions over that distance was  
8.7kph.  I expect to get up to average of 10.5kph in calm weather.   
Time will tell.

The one weakness with the prop is reverse thrust.  I need to spin  
quite fast to go astern.  Quite different to a fixed bladed prop.

I noticed my previous link to the prop photo was missing a bit.  Here
