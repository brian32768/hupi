<PRE>I went out in some blustery conditions today to test my latest boat.

It is version 15 or V15_5m.  I have a few refinements but I think  
this will be the basis for more boats if I make any more for own use  
or for others.  This one has been designed and built to suit my  
sister who is lighter than me.  It still performs well with more weight.

I ordered a purpose made gearbox from Mitrpak for this boat.    
Marcopolo boats have decided to stock some of these modified boxes so  
they are more readily available.

Wind was up to 70kph so not the ideal day for first outing.  I was  
pleased with how it went.  I want to make a few adjustments but the  
changes have all worked as intended.  The wave-piercing bow works  
very well in waves.  There seems to be no tendency to bury into the  
back of waves when running that I have experienced with the earlier  
hulls.

I have created a web page for this new boat here:
