<PRE>Thanks for the report and link, Rick. Cool looking and wave functional 
creation you came up with! Good strut reinforcement for rough water, yet 
seems to keep folding capability. Suspect you might be sending your sister 
to set records at sea :-)  ?
I see you went with a flex shaft and folding prop on this model as well. It 
appears that the shaft runs free inside the shell, but with a skeg/bearing 
only at the prop location. If so, that is something new as well.

On anothe note, wonder if you ever got the time to test out the idea of a 
carbon fiber sleeve reinforcement on your flex shaft?

explore this yet.

&gt;<i>I went out in some blustery conditions today to test my latest boat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is version 15 or V15_5m.  I have a few refinements but I think  this 
</I>&gt;<i> will be the basis for more boats if I make any more for own use  or for 
</I>&gt;<i> others.  This one has been designed and built to suit my  sister who is 
</I>&gt;<i> lighter than me.  It still performs well with more weight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ordered a purpose made gearbox from Mitrpak for this boat.    Marcopolo 
</I>&gt;<i> boats have decided to stock some of these modified boxes so  they are more 
</I>&gt;<i> readily available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wind was up to 70kph so not the ideal day for first outing.  I was 
</I>&gt;<i> pleased with how it went.  I want to make a few adjustments but the 
</I>&gt;<i> changes have all worked as intended.  The wave-piercing bow works  very 
</I>&gt;<i> well in waves.  There seems to be no tendency to bury into the  back of 
</I>&gt;<i> waves when running that I have experienced with the earlier  hulls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have created a web page for this new boat here:
