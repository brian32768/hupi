<PRE>Hi All

I have a 22 ft kingfisher yacht <A HREF="http://www.kyoa.org.uk/k20+technical.htm">http://www.kyoa.org.uk/k20+technical.htm</A>  I
am interested in powering it partly through human power when I am on  inland
canals etc.

I will also have a conventional outboard for when I get tired!

I plan to make a Yuloh <A HREF="http://simplicityboats.com/yulohpage2.html">http://simplicityboats.com/yulohpage2.html</A> which I
would hope to be able to use for about 2 hours a day. eg
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7MQsdLpWaM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7MQsdLpWaM</A>

In addition seems to make sense to use your more powerful  leg muscles to
power the thing. I realize that the boat will not move fast, and that it
will be hard work.

The boat has an outboard well inside the boat and I am hoping to be able to
make use of that to install a pedal system.

1) Has anyone ever fitted a mirage drive to a boat this big? With what
results?

2) I am aware of the escargot
<A HREF="http://www.mission-base.com/pedal-power/pp_escargot_photos.html">http://www.mission-base.com/pedal-power/pp_escargot_photos.html</A> are there
any other large pedal powered boats out there?

3) I have had a browse on these archives, and have seen people making props
out of model aeroplane propellers, would the prop need to be longer for such
a heavy boat?

4) I am thinking of aiming for this kind of set up
<A HREF="http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system">http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system</A> I
thought I might start with this cheap gearbox
<A HREF="http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=43541&amp;C=Froogle&amp;U=43541&amp;T=Module">http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=43541&amp;C=Froogle&amp;U=43541&amp;T=Module</A>
and
upgrade it later if the boat actually moves under pedal power.

Any comments or suggestions?

Thanks

Sam
</PRE>
