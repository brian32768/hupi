<PRE>Rick

Seeing your V15 design has put me on a new design tangent. I have been slowly making a new proa, one that is lighter and narrower. I have only made the hull so far and have not decked it in as I keep changing my mind. The hull is 5m long and 200mm beam with a depth of 250mm, basic box section with a small rocker on the bottom. 

My main design criteria is to use the involute gearbox and the boat can be setup sitting flat on the beach. With the V15 being able to sit flat and the shaft raised and lowered it is a much simpler way to go. The proa works well but needs heavier beams and needs more setting up, a stabilized monohull has smaller lighter beams and a lot less setting up. The proa is always pushing two hulls through the water, even though the outrigger is long and narrow it is still drag in the water. 

I would not have the involute gearbox permanently fitted but bolt it in and out each time as it's a heavy hunk of metal. The dipping rudders I will give a try as its less drag and lets the boat sit flat on the beach, also they don't get in the way of the shaft.

The narrow hull allows for the gearbox to be 200mm above the deck instead of 300mm as the pedals are over the side of the boat. 

After all that I am looking at a boat like V14 but with the shaft through the hull and bolt on outriggers.
