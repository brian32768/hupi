Subject: [hpv-boats] V15 Shaft

&gt;<i> Vic
</I>&gt;<i> I tried the 6mm sleeve I had on a 1/4&quot; spring steel shaft.  I was 
</I>&gt;<i> disappointed because it did not make measurable increase in the  torsional 
</I>&gt;<i> rigidity.  It is an effective way to protect the shaft.   When I tested it 
</I>&gt;<i> the epoxy was only a couple of days old so not fully  cured.  I will do a 
</I>&gt;<i> more precise side-by-side comparison with  unsleeved rod at some point.
</I>

Was this shaft you constructed covered with only a single layer of carbon 
fiber mesh tube?
What kind of epoxy did you use, and did you use the heat shrink tubing 
method to tighten up to the shaft?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Mark Drela commented it would have been smarter to use thicker  tube. 
</I>&gt;<i> It is much easier to reduce the diameter of the tube by  pulling it tight 
</I>&gt;<i> than it is to increase the diameter when it is  loose.  The fibes in the 
</I>&gt;<i> sleeve are running more like 20 to 30  degrees than 45.
</I>
Could that angle strength be improved somehow, say by using multiple layers 
set in offset mesh pattern, alternately reversed from a lengthwise 
direction?

Thanks,

Vic


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new shaft is a combination 12mm aluminium rod through a HDPE pipe  in 
</I>&gt;<i> the hull and 8mm spring steel beyond the tube.  The steel portion  slots 
</I>&gt;<i> into the aluminium.  That connection is epoxy glued and I have  wrapped a 
</I>&gt;<i> few layers of glass tape over the joint.  I made a small  sleeve from 
</I>&gt;<i> UHMWPE for the bearing at the bottom of the shaft tube.   The tube exits 
</I>&gt;<i> just behind the gearbox so it does not need to be sealed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The folding prop sheds most weed so I do not need access to it.  It  is 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to get a bit of weed wrapped around the hub but that will 
</I>&gt;<i> usually dislodge by reversing.  Most floating weed gets pushed aside  by 
</I>&gt;<i> the hull.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having the prop right out the stern reduced the tendency to ventilate  in 
</I>&gt;<i> waves.  This improves as I go faster because the boat sits bow up  a 
</I>&gt;<i> little and the prop goes deeper.  In the 1 to 2 ft waves yesterday  the 
</I>&gt;<i> prop only ventilated a couple of times.  The side mounted prop  would have 
</I>&gt;<i> ventilated more often in waves like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rick
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On anothe note, wonder if you ever got the time to test out the idea  of a
</I>&gt;<i> carbon fiber sleeve reinforcement on your flex shaft?
