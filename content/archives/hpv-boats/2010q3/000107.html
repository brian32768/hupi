<PRE>Vic
It was only a single layer.  The epoxy was Solid Bond 330.  This is  
the TDS:

The bond did not break but it would not have reached fully cured  
state when I tested.

The fibres were tight to the steel because I hung the shaft from the  
tube to stretched it while it cured.

I had intended to use up to 3 layers but the tubing I purchased was  
too small to allow that.

There is no doubt that building up the number of layers would add  
stiffness.  The idea is fine but my initial execution was poor.  I  
would recommend it if you want a torsionally stiff lightweight shaft  
that will bend.  You could build it up on any round section material  
as a former.  It should be a complete seal so electrolysis will not  
be an issue.  The connections would also be epoxy glued.

Was this shaft you constructed covered with only a single layer of  
carbon
fiber mesh tube?
What kind of epoxy did you use, and did you use the heat shrink tubing
method to tighten up to the shaft?


Could that angle strength be improved somehow, say by using multiple  
layers
set in offset mesh pattern, alternately reversed from a lengthwise
direction?

Thanks,

</PRE>
