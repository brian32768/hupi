Essentially yes but suggest leave the former there.

If I was going for really light I would go for aluminium tube as the  
former.  6mm tube is very light and you can hang during curing to  
ensure it is straight.

Wooden dowel would also be OK.

You probably want a minimum of three layers of the weight I used to  
get suitable strength - CF303.  I would go for 25+feet of the 1/2&quot;  
CF9313 if I was doing it again.  With the aim of minimum of 3  
layers.   Anything less and it will be too fragile to connect to and  
handle.

Providing you get it thick enough it has the fibres ideally oriented  
for torsional rigidity while having bending compliance.  Without the  
firmer core it would be more prone to buckling failure so I would  
leave the former inside.

I will compare torsional rigidity today with unsheethed rod using  
same torque.

Rick, if you can suffer one more pesky question? This can be answered  
with a
yes or no.

Do you think there would be enough LONGITUDINAL stiffness in a tube  
formed
from layers of the expoxied mesh alone, to mimic the round section
behaviour, IF you dissolve out the round section?

Hope this makes sense, as I as my goal is to get the lightest, thinnest,
strongest, flex shaft possible.

Vic
