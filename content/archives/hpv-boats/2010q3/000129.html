<PRE>Rick, lots of good info on material I don't know much about, Thanks! I did 
use a 0.18&quot; pultruded CF shaft sometime ago until it tangled in a root and 
fractured. It was great, unlike anything else while it lasted, for my 
particular gadget. I am trying for even thinner and lighter using maybe one 
carbon mesh layer, since there is not a lot of torque demand in normal 
conditions. The lighter the lever arm in my application the better. I have 
also experimented with longish tapered spinners fore and aft of the prop, 
made from lightweight FLOATING material. Interesting advantages to these 
spinners when combined with a lightweight shaft and prop, as it introduces 
some upward forces that allow some degree of reverse, among other things....

Vic

</I>&gt;<i> It could easily reduce to half nominal diameter.  The fibres will run  a 
</I>&gt;<i> little straighter so will increase buckling resistance but not so  much to 
</I>&gt;<i> torsional rigidity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you only wanted to go to around 1/4&quot; overall you might get 3  layers on 
</I>&gt;<i> something starting at 1/8&quot;.  I think you would have to wait  for some 
</I>&gt;<i> initial cure before putting on each layer.  With epoxy you  can accelerate 
</I>&gt;<i> the curing by heating.  The other way would be to  place all layers dry 
</I>&gt;<i> and then really soak the shaft, working until  wetted out.  The fibres 
</I>&gt;<i> tend to form tiny needles that catch on  successive layers as they are 
</I>&gt;<i> slid on.  The more damage the more  needles.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, Rick you have given me a lot to think about.  Those are quite
</I>&gt;<i> impressive measurements.
</I>&gt;<i> How thin will the 1/4&quot; mesh go when stretched tight on a rod, as I am
</I>&gt;<i> shooting for about 1/8&quot; on the rod part. That way I can add another  layer
</I>&gt;<i> for strength if needed. Can I get small amounts of the equivalent  epoxy 
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> USA, is my next question to research....
