<PRE>Hi Clem
Still plenty of room for improvement yet.

I can simplify the building a bit.  I will also alter the back. It  
does not need to be as long to get the aerodynamic benefit and is a  
pain to construct the tortured curve.

The rudders need some work.  I am not sure how much at this stage.   
During the test I ended up with only one rudder working because the  
other worked loose so have to fix that.

I have a slightly lower drag design dubbed V15_6m that I am playing  
with.  The aim with it is to get something with the best high speed  
performance having 100kg displacement.  Something that a good athlete  
could better Olympic single scull times over 2000m.  It is optimised  
for 18kph.  The seat back is more inclined similar to the inclination  
I have on the V14 seat now.

Rick

Wow
Rick, you really are a genius!
This boat is perfect - the result of an evolutionary process.
The folding prop, the free floating shaft, the hull configuration, the
ultralight materials, the sleek pelican design: Your sister will be  
proud of
her custom made human powered speed boat.
Congratulations!

Best greetings
Clemens
