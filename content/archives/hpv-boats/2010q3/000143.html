Many thanks for this link - it certainly has the makings of an option.

Something like this? <A HREF="http://www.shuttlebike.com/">http://www.shuttlebike.com/</A> There is also a version 
made in Oz which is supposed to be more efficient discussed somewhere on 
boat design forums discussion. The main issues are large losses when going 
through the wheel of an existing bike. Rick Willoughby has written of a non 
bike, dedicated drive system that can move a large vessel at about 3 knots 
or so..

Hope this helps,


Vic

&gt;<i>I am a sailor and a cyclist.  I'm in the process of buying a 20ft 
</I>&gt;<i>mini-cruiser (for details see <A HREF="http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html">http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html</A>) 
</I>&gt;<i>and I'm hoping, in my imminent retirement, to sail through Europe on its 
</I>&gt;<i>great network of waterways. The boat will have an outboard, but I'd love to 
</I>&gt;<i>be able to propel it using a bicycle - for example on days when there's no 
</I>&gt;<i>wind, or if I have a stretch of narrow water where I have to battle a 
</I>&gt;<i>headwind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, I would use my road bike, mounted in the cockpit on a stand fore 
</I>&gt;<i> and aft, with a chain on the rear-wheel cog to drive a cog on the stern of 
</I>&gt;<i> the boat, which in turn drives an outboard-style propeller.  Any 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions as to where I might get hold of the bike-powered outboard kit 
</I>&gt;<i> would be much appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
