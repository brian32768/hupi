&gt;<i> Vic
</I>&gt;<i> It was only a single layer.  The epoxy was Solid Bond 330.  This is  the 
</I>&gt;<i> TDS:

</I>&gt;<i> The bond did not break but it would not have reached fully cured  state 
</I>&gt;<i> when I tested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fibres were tight to the steel because I hung the shaft from the  tube 
</I>&gt;<i> to stretched it while it cured.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had intended to use up to 3 layers but the tubing I purchased was  too 
</I>&gt;<i> small to allow that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no doubt that building up the number of layers would add 
</I>&gt;<i> stiffness.  The idea is fine but my initial execution was poor.  I  would 
</I>&gt;<i> recommend it if you want a torsionally stiff lightweight shaft  that will 
</I>&gt;<i> bend.  You could build it up on any round section material  as a former. 
</I>&gt;<i> It should be a complete seal so electrolysis will not  be an issue.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> connections would also be epoxy gued.
</I>
Rick, if you can suffer one more pesky question? This can be answered with a 
yes or no.

Do you think there would be enough LONGITUDINAL stiffness in a tube formed 
from layers of the expoxied mesh alone, to mimic the round section 
behaviour, IF you dissolve out the round section?

Hope this makes sense, as I as my goal is to get the lightest, thinnest, 
strongest, flex shaft possible.

</I>&gt;<i> Was this shaft you constructed covered with only a single layer of  carbon
</I>&gt;<i> fiber mesh tube?
</I>&gt;<i> What kind of epoxy did you use, and did you use the heat shrink tubing
</I>&gt;<i> method to tighten up to the shaft?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could that angle strength be improved somehow, say by using multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> layers
</I>&gt;<i> set in offset mesh pattern, alternately reversed from a lengthwise
</I>&gt;<i> direction?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
