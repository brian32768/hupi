It could easily reduce to half nominal diameter.  The fibres will run  
a little straighter so will increase buckling resistance but not so  
much to torsional rigidity.

If you only wanted to go to around 1/4&quot; overall you might get 3  
layers on something starting at 1/8&quot;.  I think you would have to wait  
for some initial cure before putting on each layer.  With epoxy you  
can accelerate the curing by heating.  The other way would be to  
place all layers dry and then really soak the shaft, working until  
wetted out.  The fibres tend to form tiny needles that catch on  
successive layers as they are slid on.  The more damage the more  
needles.

Thanks, Rick you have given me a lot to think about.  Those are quite
impressive measurements.
How thin will the 1/4&quot; mesh go when stretched tight on a rod, as I am
shooting for about 1/8&quot; on the rod part. That way I can add another  
layer
for strength if needed. Can I get small amounts of the equivalent  
epoxy in
USA, is my next question to research....
