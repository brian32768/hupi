<PRE>Ian
I have a flexible strut to prevent the shaft from hanging down too  
far - just a simple UHMWPE bush.  It also allows an effective reverse.

I wanted to get the outriggers as far back as I could while having  
the bracing off the wider and higher part of the hull.  Having the  
outriggers near the stern avoids flop roll when running with waves.

I am not sure if I like the folding system.  It puts the front of the  
outriggers near the balance point so makes it more awkward to carry  
than it should be when they are folded in.  It is quick and easy to  
launch but it should be easier to carry given the light weight.  I  
might spread them on the trailer next time.

I will probably convert V14 hull to something similar to V15 and I  
will just use the slide-in tubes for the outriggers rather than the  
folding.

I expect I will be there next weekend but I would like better weather  
to do proper set up.  I will let you know through the week.  I can  
easily  transport two boats now.

I think the involute would fit as it is.  It depends on the leg  
length because the shaft inclines at a slightly higher angle than  
torque box it mounts off.  So the clearance increases as the box is  
moved forward.  A racing version of this boat could have the heavier  
box.  A strong rider should be able to get it 20kph as this requires  
less power than to get V11 or V14 to that speed.  However you would  
not want to try that with the little gearbox.

I have a couple of changes to the design that would make it easier to  
build.  It would not be difficult to adjust the angle of the torque  
box to suit a higher gearbox.  Mine might be a bit too wide for the  
involute box as well.

So far the hull seems to work extremely well in waves.  My rudders  
are a work in progress.  I am using nylon gears rather than pull  
cords and it has some problems at the moment so turning is not where  
I want it yet.

Right now my gearbox is a bit too close for me.  I will leave it like  
that so it might be just about right for you and Ian Knox who wants  
to have a go.

        Saw the pics and video of V15 looks great. The
trailer would make transport easy and there would be
no setting up. Does the boat have a skeg or is the
shaft unsupported? Is there a reason for the outrigger
fixing points being towards the front and not in the
middle?
        When will you be at Lysterfield lake next? Give
me a date and time and I'll see you there. Would be
great to see the boat on the water.
        Can the involute gearbox be fitted to the V15 design?
