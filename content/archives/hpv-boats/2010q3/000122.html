<PRE>By way of encouragement re. moving a large boat via human power -

I watched Larry Pardey scull &quot;Taleisin&quot;, which was 29-feet 6-inches,  
with a 10-foot 9-inch beam, and 17,800 lbs. displacement, into a berth  
at Port Townsend, Washington, during one of the Wooden Boat Festivals .

Slow, but workable, and I didn't get the impression he was working  
exhaustively.

IIRC, he was using a long sweep over a stern quarter without foot  
power, but I could be mis-remembering that detail (foot/no foot).

Pretty impressive to see, ...but I wouldn't want to try it against any  
headwind.

Larry ( Interesting to see this new burst of activity on what seems to  
have become largely a ghost forum!)
