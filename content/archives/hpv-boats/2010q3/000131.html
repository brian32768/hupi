<PRE>Hi Guys,

My email box filled up near the end of the six months I was in India.  I was
so swamped teaching classes and
other chores that  I didn't get the mailbox cleaned out until today.

I am presently at a friend's sustainable farm 100 miles away from Houston,
Texas.  I am helping them out for
another week maybe ten days before heading east to South Florida.  After
visiting family and friends there,
 I will be heading back home to southern California.

I would love to meet other members of the group even if only for a chat over
a cup of coffee and pie.
I welcome invitations of hospitality.  I really would love to see some
homemade human powered vehicles

I love helping folks.  I am good at solving problems - computers, cars and
sometimes personal problems.
I am easy company and would love to hear your stories.  I have a few to tell
myself.

Huggs and my best wishes,
Bobby Ray
</PRE>
