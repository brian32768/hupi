Thanks for this.  There is indeed an Italian device, called a shuttlebike, with a fancy website showing how it operates.  The gadget itself wouldn't help me much but I'm investigating the use of its key component, which is a flexible cable shaft.

Roger,

There was an Italian outfit that did just what you describe on the market
maybe 5 or 10 years ago.  Haven't heard about it recently.  You might try an
internet search for it.

I am a sailor and a cyclist.  I'm in the process of buying a 20ft
mini-cruiser (for details see <A HREF="http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html">http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html</A>) and
I'm hoping, in my imminent retirement, to sail through Europe on its great
network of waterways. The boat will have an outboard, but I'd love to be
able to propel it using a bicycle - for example on days when there's no
wind, or if I have a stretch of narrow water where I have to battle a
headwind.

Ideally, I would use my road bike, mounted in the cockpit on a stand fore
and aft, with a chain on the rear-wheel cog to drive a cog on the stern of
the boat, which in turn drives an outboard-style propeller.  Any suggestions
as to where I might get hold of the bike-powered outboard kit would be much
appreciated.

Roger Boden
