<PRE>Hi Rick,

It's great to see that you are still pushing the envelope! That's a great looking boat.

I tried the 6mm sleeve I had on a 1/4&quot; spring steel shaft.&#160; I was disappointed because it did not make measurable increase in the torsional rigidity.&#160; It is an effective way to protect the shaft.&#160; When I tested it the epoxy was only a couple of days old so not fully cured.&#160; I will do a more precise side-by-side comparison with unsleeved rod at some point.

As Mark Drela commented it would have been smarter to use thicker tube.&#160; It is much easier to reduce the diameter of the tube by pulling it tight than it is to increase the diameter when it is loose.&#160; The fibes in the sleeve are running more like 20 to 30 degrees than 45.

The new shaft is a combination 12mm aluminium rod through a HDPE pipe in the hull and 8mm spring steel beyond the tube.&#160; The steel portion slots into the aluminium.&#160; That connection is epoxy glued and I have wrapped a few layers of glass tape over the joint.&#160; I made a small sleeve from UHMWPE for the bearing at the bottom of the shaft tube.&#160; The tube exits just behind the gearbox so it does not need to be sealed.

The folding prop sheds most weed so I do not need access to it.&#160; It is possible to get a bit of weed wrapped around the hub but that will usually dislodge by reversing.&#160; Most floating weed gets pushed aside by the hull.

Having the prop right out the stern reduced the tendency to ventilate in waves.&#160; This improves as I go faster because the boat sits bow up a little and the prop goes deeper.&#160; In the 1 to 2 ft waves yesterday the prop only ventilated a couple of times.&#160; The side mounted prop would have ventilated more often in waves like that.

Rick

On anothe note, wonder if you ever got the time to test out the idea of a
carbon fiber sleeve reinforcement on your flex shaft?
<A HREF="http://www.cstsales.com/carbon_braid.html&#160;">http://www.cstsales.com/carbon_braid.html&#160;</A> I haven't had free time to
explore this yet.
