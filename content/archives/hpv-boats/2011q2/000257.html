<PRE>Tried out the outrigger steering method today, it did turn tighter. I mounted

the asymmetric outriggers the opposite way with the flat side outboard and

the curved side inboard. The rudders were rigidly fixed to the aft end of  the

outriggers, 100mm deep x 150mm long set at 30 deg. Leaning into the turn

I could only immerse the rudder about 10-15mm, if I had leaned any further

I might have gone for a swim. The main turning force came from the shape of

the outrigger, the rudder had little effect. The rudders were set 50mm above

the waterline, any lower and they would have been causing drag from the waves.

With the directional prop hard over and leaning into the turn it is the best I've

had out of this boat. Tried turning using the outriggers only keeping the prop

running straight and the boat was very slow to turn, seemed better to port than

starboard. This may have something to do with the prop rotation.

It might work better with better designed outriggers but the main turning force

came from the directional prop.

To see some pics this is the link, post #1125
