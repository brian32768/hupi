It was a miserable day and I spent a good deal of time waiting for  
Dean to set up his boat.  He then got about 100m and a pin in his new  
gearbox failed.  It was a crappy spring pin that the machinists  
fitted after fitting the crank shaft. His latest box is a well made  
two speed hand drill with a double gear set.  Very nice gears but  
only bushes for bearings - also very light.  He has still not yet got  
around to fitting the Involute box he bought from me.

The gears in my home made box are larger than the set in the involute  
box.  So the gears will take probably take higher loads but my case  
is not as rigid so it might flex more.  I think I would twist the  
shaft before the gears brake.  It felt very smooth and ran quietly.   
The weather was not conducive to sprinting and my fitness level is  
more consistent with building boats than racing them right now.

You could also save a bit of weight using a carbon fibre shaft but I  
will work out any easy way to wind them and how much the carbon will  
cost.

The weather is looking good for next Saturday.   By then the paint  
will even be cured.

Rick


re:
        New boat looks good, see what you can crank
it up to when the weather improves. How much load
can the gearbox take, is it on a par with the involute?
