<PRE>Clem re
Seems like your amas touch the surface constantly. With an extremely  
narrow
width of 225mm you have to ensure stability in one or the other way.  
I would
be interested in how much drag your amas produce at the present setting.

At the start of each day I have about 5kg of water and food on board  
and the stabilisers are on the surface.  As the day wears on the  
water is reduced and I lose body weight.  I end up about 7kg lighter  
at the end of the day and the stabilisers are well clear of the water  
if there are no waves.

I can balance the boat by moving my weight and keep both stabilisers  
above the water.  If they touch it is momentary.  I tend to operate  
these by the sound.  You can hear them clipping the water and if one  
is doing it more than the other I move a little.  In a strong side  
wind I move my back across the seat by 100mm or more.

If there is small chop the stabilisers just clip the tops of the  
waves.  In this condition the boat tends to ride flat without have to  
balance with my body.

Anyhow my aim is to keep the stabilisers off the water and the most  
significant drag from them is windage.
