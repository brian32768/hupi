I am going to change tires on my GTE as they are dry rotting. Now the probl=
em for me is what size. I want to go with Marathon Plus because I don't wan=
t to change any flats if possible. The tires don't have any #'s on them exc=
ept 20x175. When I look for tires they have other #'s for the tire. The tir=
es on the Ute also have a HS348 even though it says 20x175 and I don't unde=
r stand what all these mean and don't want to buy the wrong size tire. Any =
suggestions?? Thanks Fran

This trike has been sitting for years and the brake levers close all the wa=
y. Over the years I have let out I think 1drop of fluid a couple times as t=
he brakes froze up in the heat of the building I store it in. I would think=
 maybe it needs more fluid but does anyone know what kind and where to get =
it. I know the Rohloff needs changing and I have that but what about the Sc=
hlumph Mountain Drive. It only has about 25 miles on it but has about 11 ye=
ars of just sitting waiting to be ridden. Any help -suggestions is greatly =
appreciated. Fran .=20

Sorry about all the question. I should know some of this but don't. The per=
son wanting to ride my GTE is about 250 lbs. It was built for me at 176 lbs=
. Do you think it would be ok for him with 2 sets of panniers pulling a tra=
iler? We are planning a long tour and trikes would be so much better then o=
ur bikes. He doesn't have one and I have plenty and thinking about riding t=
hem. Fran

It sounds like what you want is a "406-42" or something close in the
last two digits.  The 406 corresponds to the 20" diameter of your tire,
in mm.  The 42 corresponds to the 1.75" width of your tire, in mm.
There is actually a decimal point in your 175.

I knew the 406 was a 20 inch wheel but didn't know what else I needed to kn=
ow before deciding on a tire size. Yes the tire said 20x 1.75. Thanks

After many years of service my Bionx system has given up and is not  
repairable. I would like to replace it with a better model but am having  trouble. 
Bionx had told my dealer the model I want would not be available until  
December 2011 That date has since been changed to February. I am 82 and need  
help on hills. Since Bionx seems to be having troubles does anyone have any  
suggestions as to an alternate solution to my problem?

Hi Fran,

I'm trying to remember what I use on the Hope brakes - I think it is =
just light mineral oil - the bottle I have to hand is actually Singer =
sewing machine oil. This job is most easily done by a bike shop tho - I =
don't like adjusting the hydraulic brakes if I don't have to. A local =
mountain bike shop should be able to work the brakes for you for maybe =
$20 - they are just the same as mountain bike brakes.

I'd expect the Rohloff & Schlumpf to just need some exercise... As long =
as they had oil coverage when they went away then I'd hope for them =
still to be sealed and ready to go. A routine oil change on both would =
be a good precaution but I'd give them a try first. You might have more =
problems with the drive chain though, depending on the conditions around =
where the bike has been stored - sometimes they rust solid if they =
weren't well protected before being put away.

Good luck!

Rob

Hi Fran,

You are going to be wanting 47-406 Marathon Plus (just a little short of =
2in wide). Probably as well to remember to add new tubes too if the =
existing tyres have rotted.

I have the smaller 35-406 and they are fine but a bit harsh.


HS348 is the tyre/tread name on the other tyres - just an alternative to =
saying 'Marathon Plus' or whatever on them.

Cheers,

Rob

Hi Rob,

If you were to put mineral oil in a car brake system there would be
no assurance that the components and seals would have the expected
performance or life expectancy.

A designer of a modern braking system would most likely (to avoid liability
issues) select materials to go with the glycol ether and polydimethylsiloxane
that are typically used.  These should be OK if mixed together.  If you are
still in the business of selling and servicing trikes, you might want to
consider using approved brake fluids just to CYA.

Mineral oil was common in decades past; it is no longer considered a
quality brake fluid.  There is also an additive package blended with DOT X
fluids that extend their performance and life.

Food grade mineral oil will have no additives to prolong life, and all
mineral oils are fragile in comparison to the common brake fluids when
exposed to air and heat.  They quickly form polymeric sludges when abused.
  FWIW, I am currently working with an apparatus using mineral oil at 400F,
so the specifications are fresh in my mind.

Mike

Yes, but -- as you may have overlooked -- we don't drive no cars here ...

No, not for bicycle use. A "designer" (??? I would prefer an engineer) of 
a "modern" (whatever that means) braking system should use something 
appropriate for the specific task.

This is wrong. Mineral oil (or better "hydraulic fluid") is a very 
appropriate medium for hydraulic bicycle brakes. All hydraulic Magura 
brakes for example are bleeded with mineral oil and will be destroyed by 
car brake fluid.

Hi Mike,

Erm, we weren't talking cars, we were talking turn of the millennium =
Hope cycle hydraulics that have been sat in a shed for the last half of =
that.

The same problem exists with some cycle hydraulic brakes - Hayes are the =
tricksy ones I've owned using hazardous fluids where as all other brands =
I've owned have had more 'user friendly' blood.

Either way, the advice holds - first line of attack is to let the local =
specialists do the job - they'll get the brakes cleaned and serviced =
more quickly than Fran or I will be able to do at home, with specialist =
parts such as replacement seals and the fluids & service kit with =
correct fittings, and all probably for little more than the cost of an =
eat-in snack as they do the work. Having chatted with Fran in the past I =
don't think brake servicing would be a job she'd actively want to take =
on herself. I do the same with the hydraulic stuff myself - every trike =
seems to have a different brand/model of brake and the local guy has the =
service kit to hand and the livelihood to maintain.

Rob

Put this question to yourself: should I use everyone else to attain
happiness, or should I help others gain happiness?

My commentary is general regarding disc brakes.  Some of us including Fran
ride long tours where a basic understanding of some details can come in
handy in the hinterlands. Many of us do not have handy
trike savvy mechanics to rely on or the funds to pay them. Hopefully,
knowing that brake fluids can be be intermixed and that they all will work
safely together will save someone extra trouble when the local auto parts
store only has automotive brake fluid.  I can imagine knowing that olive
oil might work in a pinch being useful information.  (Actually a number
of vegetable oils have higher boiling points than mineral oil, thought they
may break down quickly, they would probably get you down off
a mountain safely and without damage to the parts.)

Rather than quash this thread, I would really like to know more about
Magura components being incompatible with normal brake fluid. Obviously, I
would never have assumed such a thing.  Sounds like crazy talk to me.

Hope produces a specific fluid for their brakes.  It is not the  classic 
corrosive brake fluid used in cars.  I think it is mineral-oil  based, but I 
would have the local bike shop fill, bleed and service the  brakes.  I I 
liked the Hopes I had on my first tandem much more than the  Maguras that GS 
went to.  We recently had another trike built up locally,  and the shop used 
the cable actuated Avid 7s. I specified these to avoid  problems  while on 
long trips in the "boonies".. The feel is not quite as  good as the 
hydraulics,but now I don'tworry about leaks or nicked hoses.

It was Sachs cycle hydraulics that I first used, which later became part =
of SRAM. They recommended using light mineral oil.

Later using Maguras, including 'Big' and the same advice was given. They =
also always seemed to recommend fitting new 'olives' each time a =
connection was remade - maybe a clue to preventing seal deterioration? =
Or just routine replacement or a part that takes damage.

I wouldn't have said this was an incompatibility with 'normal' brake =
fluid as an imported 'Hayes' disc brake on the rear of my tandem was the =
first cycle hydraulic brake I encountered that followed the automotive =
DOT route rather than skin-safe mineral oil.

The Hope discs that Fran has were common on trikes of the era - the ones =
with the brake handle with a screw-in adjustment cylinder on each =
handle. They seemed to have a disadvantage that they suffered from =
locking up due to overheating when left in somewhere hot. The adjustment =
range of the cylinder was insufficient to adjust the range back to =
usability necessitating dumping oil as Fran mentioned. When temperatures =
drop, or if too much fluid is dumped, this can leave the brakes with the =
levers moving to no effect.=20

Hope do a nice little bleed kit that looks like it might be the part for =
in-the-field bleeding and that takes pressure from a car inner tube but =
I've not worked out if it is compatible with the necessary generation of =
Hope hardware yet.

You really like the BB7s Keith?

I've found the power & modulation to be great but I seem to have to =
adjust them for one thing or another most every 2nd week. I've been =
trying to work out whether adjustment is drifting (which seems unlikely =
given how stiff the adjustment knobs are), whether the pads take on =
moisture from the air (so vary in width as the weather changes) or =
something else is moving (which I've not spotted yet)...

I've gone for the new 90mm Sturmey Archer drums on my next velo.

I like BB7's on my trike. Only have to adjust them once a season.

The SA 70mm drums work great on the WAW velo. I suspect its because there
are separate Avid Speed Dial levers for each drum.

The same drums were bad on the Go One velo with the puny ganged levers
common on the u-joint tiller steered velos.

Hope brakes have always used automotive brake fluid. Same goes for  
Hayes, Avid, and Formula. Only Magura and Shimano use mineral oil.

Just to confuse the issue further not all hydraulic brakes use "oil"
The Bitex brakes on my trike use what they label "Climate Control Fluid".
It looks to me like radiator fluid, ethylene glycol. I'd like to know 
what it really is.
It seems each brake is different and we need to find what it uses.
I agree that on this occasion Fran should give the expert the job and 
watch and ask questions if possible.
She will then be in a better position to know what to do in the future.

I wanted to buy more chain to lengthen my chain on the GTE but is says SRAM=
 pc-40 and seems that is not made anymore. I have been told it may be a sin=
gle speed chain and could use any single speed chain to lengthen it and I h=
ave been told it is probably an 8 sp chain. Sooooooooo. I still don't know =
what chain to buy to add to it so some longer legs can pedal the trike. It =
has a Rohloff hub and Schlumph Mountain drive if that helps any. Is there a=
 chain I can just add to it or do I have to buy all new chain. ???

http://www.maguradirect.com/magura.html

"Rather than the usual, toxic and corrsoive brake fluid which requires 
regular changes, all MAGURA brakes have used mineral oil since the very 
beginning. And as the Royal Blood has been proven in millions of brake 
systems we are the only manufacturer that gives a 5 year warranty on all 
seals!"

Magura doesn't say that other brake fluids will be a problem, only that
they are fans of mineral oil.

I have had DOT 5.0 in my early GTO with Hopes for nearly 10 years now.
 FWIW, the same fluid.  DOT 5.0 is the silicon oil that was developed for
antique cars and intended to be non-corrosive (won't damage pretty paint)
and non-reactive/long lasting - at the expense of expanding more and giving
a somewhat less solid feel.  I am not sure, but I think epoxy powder coast
may be pretty immune to DOT 3, 4, 5.1 fluids,  Probably polyurethane paints
don't care - I never see any damage to my autos when I am sloppy.  It will
tear up a nice lacquer paint job though.

I always bleed out and replace all the DOT 3 fluid in used cars I buy (to
remove any accumulate moisture that does cause steel parts to deteriorate,
fouls the fluid, and ruins the wheel cylinders), but I don't know anyone
else that does so.  Nothing unusual about buying a 10 to 20 year old car
with original DOT 3 in it. Water fouled fluid doesn't do much to aluminum
and stainless steel.

Not to be argumentative though it must seem so at this point, the Magura
verbage sounds like marketing hype.   I still wonder what materials they
actually use for their elastomeric parts and about their compatibility.

Be advised also that residents of countries in which REAL Citroens are sold 
can use LHM - Citroen hydraulic fluid - which costs less for a litre than 
Magura charges for a thimble-full.

Thanks, Zach!

Well then, that is definitive.  IMO they could have designed it for the
flexible use of many brake fluids, but did not.  Not an attractive feature
to me.  I wonder what their reasoning was.

I recently bought a 55 US gallon drum of high quality mineral oil for
$1500. http://www.paratherm.com/Paratherm-OR/ORbulletin.asp#Oxidation I use
it as a heat transfer fluid (very abusive). Anyone need some (just
kidding)?  That would be $2.55 for a 12 oz jar at cost.

Here is mineral oil for less, for breaking in air craft engines $1050 /
barrel:
http://www.skygeek.com/60006-drum.html?utm_source=3Dgooglebase&utm_medium=
=3Dshoppingengine&utm_content=3D60006-drum&utm_campaign=3Dfroogle
and far less for use as a hydraulic fluid - $650 a barrel:
http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200408668_200408668?cm_sp=3D=
Upsells-_-Top%20Sellers-_-Product%20Page


I see that DOT 3 may cost more, $1828 / 55gallon drum.
http://www.fastenal.com/web/products/detail.ex?sku=3D5100434&ucst=3Dt
but no, here it is for less:
http://www.drillspot.com/products/506830/gunk_m4449_dot_3_brake_fluid?s=3D1
Fastenal is clearly not the low cost provider.

Maybe Magura uses mineral oil to save money?  With it they can use rubber
seals, instead of Viton and silicon rubber seals which cost more, and
provide better durability.

Magura is a lower cost brake system?  Just curious.  If not, then they may
have higher margins.  No reason to be offended by that if they work well.

DOT 5 is OK with natural rubber parts:
http://www.clearcoproducts.com/pdf/specialty/NP-dot-5-brake-fluid.pdf
This would be the high cost leader I think.

Only DOT 3 and mineral oil are readily available in 55 gallon quantities.
 DOT > 3 is much less common.

This is the sort of first cut investigation a product design engineer will
do regarding every part in a machine.  For trikes you would need to extend
the investigation to encompass international suppilers, shipping, and
currency issues.

Perhaps because Sachs and Magura were the orginators of hydraulic =
systems on pedal cycles. The original Sachs parts I owned in the late =
90s (and which were established products at the time) looked more =
motorcycle than pedal cycle at the time. Service advice at the time was =
to treat them as per Citroen brake systems - also mineral oil as =
mentioned by Mr Larrington.

Systems using DOT products didn't appear here until much later, =
initially at US imports and treated with mistrust due to use of =
aggressive chemicals - Hayes was the first I encountered - and they came =
with warnings of skin & paintwork damage where as the incumbent parts =
did not.

Also Magura was using mineral oil in their rim brakes dating back to  
the 1980's so they already had experience with seals for it before  
they started making disc brakes in the 1990's. Someone told me Magura  
and Shimano use mineral oil due to strict laws about toxics in  
consumer products in Germany and Japan but I don't have any  
verification of that.

This ongoing exchange highlights some reasons for switching to cable  
actuated disks.  My old GTO does just fine with it's drum brakes,so that's  not 
an issue for me, and we have toured on our GTT fully loaded in the  Sierras 
(lots of long downhills) with the Avids.  Also, we have toured with  friends, 
in very hilly areas, who have the Avids on their ICE tandem.
    I may be proven wrong in the long run, but right now, I  lean in favor 
of cable actuated disks, at least for our tandem.

Keith,

Over the years I have had numerous problems with brake and gear cables
fraying and then failing, but no trouble at all with hydraulics.
I think your concern of nicking the cables is unfounded - they are very
robust.
I gather some are tired of my making comparisons to automobiles, but cables
get some application as the very intermittent use in emergency brake
actuation, but all others use hydraulic brakes.  Properly designed
hydraulic brakes are neither finicky nor unreliable. They are also more
powerful in case one is into loaded touring.

Mike

Well. not sure if I should say this, but that has not been my=20

does not appear to do anything, but the next time the brakes is=20

as I can remember, once for the front brake and  3 times for the back=20

garage and bought the bottle of fluid (neither of us knew that mineral=20=

oil is what is supposed to be used in Magura hydraulics).

The brakes must have done at least  14,000 miles after the various=20

brake is probably mainly filled with the original mineral oil, but the=20=

back brake lost quite a lot of fluid each time I fell, so must be=20

Maybe I have just been lucky - I still have the Peer Gynt but have not=20=

again I will have doubts about the brakes.

The world's first mechanical road vehicle, Le Oblissante, had to  
operate on roads that were laid out for horse carts with their  
extreme steering angles.  With hard tires and a dismal power to  
weight ratio, this required very accurate geometry, which was  
provided by the use of irregular chainwheels.

I hope that this list will get lively again.  I thought everyone had  
moved to Facebonk, where never is heard an off-topic word, and the  
eyes are all mired all day.

Do not use both - last year I went cycle camping in Holland on my 
Ti-Rush - I had experimented before I first used my Ti-Rush for camping 
and had found it worked best with my Ortlieb front roller panniers on 
the 'mid-ship' rack and the rest of luggage in my trailer - the problem 
is that this meant the trailer was only half full - now I seem to be 
able to fill all available luggage space up, so as the trip went on (I 
was away for five weeks) the amount of luggage grew - this was not much 
of a problem in Holland (it is quite flat) but when I got home the road 
out of the ferry terminal in North Shields (near Newcastle upon Tyne in 
NE England) is a gentle up-hill but with all my luggage it was really 
difficult - I weighed my luggage when I got home and it was just under 
40 kilos (about 85 pounds) .

Mind, some of the Dutch cyclists I met while I was camping were 
carrying MUCH more than I was.

Hi Barry, I misspelled L' Obeissante, and my reference book does not  
seem to have made it to the 'net yet.  Aircraft steering yokes are  
often chain-drive to improve on cable drives, which are sloppier and  
weaker.  Care must be taken to synchronize the chordal speed  
variations by using identical sprockets and an even number of chain  
links for a smooth action with minimal slop on reversing.  For non- 
linear action such as ackerman variations, a tensioner may be  
needed.  There are lots of examples of non-circular gears, and some  
of those can be adapted for chains.

What program would you recommend for that?  Have you done it?  I've  
been wanting to do a design like that for decades.

I've learned moderation and restraint the hard way. I use Arkel RT40's =

it's all down hill.

 A Short Story for Engineers

A toothpaste factory had a problem: they sometimes shipped empty boxes,
without the tube inside. This was due to the way the production line was=

set up, and people with experience in designing production lines will te=
ll
you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precis=
e
that every single unit coming out of it is perfect 100% of the time.

Small variations in the environment (which can't be controlled in a
cost-effective fashion) mean you must have quality assurance checks smar=
tly distributed
across the line so that customers all the way down to the supermarket
don't get pissed off and buy another product instead.

Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory
got the top people in the company together and they decided to start a n=
ew
project, in which they would hire an external engineering company to
solve their empty boxes problem, as their engineering department was alr=
eady
too stretched to take on any extra effort.

The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor
allocated, RFP, third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million)
later they had a fantastic solution - on time, on budget, high quality
and everyone in the project had a great time. They solved the problem by=

using
high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights
whenever a toothpaste box would weigh less than it should. The line woul=
d stop,
and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box out of it, press=
ing
another button when done to re-start the line.

A while later, the CEO decides to have a look at the ROI of the project:=

amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after
the scales were put in place. Very few customer complaints, and they wer=
e
gaining market share. "That's some money well spent!" - he says, before
looking closely at the other statistics in the report.

It turns out, the number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after
three weeks of production use. It should've been picking up at least a
dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He
filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers come=
 back
saying the report was actually correct. The scales really weren't pickin=
g up
any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor be=
lt
were good.

Puzzled, the CEO travels down to the factory, and walks up to the part o=
f
the line where the precision scales were installed.

A few feet before the scale, there was a $20 desk fan, blowing the empty=

boxes out of the belt and into a bin.

"Oh, that," says one of the workers - "one of the guys put it there 'cau=
se
he was tired of walking over... "every time the bell rang".

The other day, after a fairly short 10 mile ride on my GTO, I noticed a 
chafing on my bottom, in the center, just above my sit bones. And the 
next morning, after scratching the area (because it had become itchy), I 
discovered that my underpants were extremely bloody. I have previously 
felt chafing in the same spot, but it never was this bad, and it never 
before bled.

I may have an explanation for this unpleasant condition: a year ago, the 
elastic that held the mesh seat in place broke, and I repaired it with 
some bungee cord I purchased from a sports shop. However, I don't think 
I did a great job: the mesh eventually folded over itself in a couple of 
places, INCLUDING EXACTLY WHERE THE CHAFING OCCURRED. A photo of the 
seat (showing the wrinkling) is attached.

Has anyone else had the same problem? For the time being, my "cure" is 
to cover the seat with some yoga mat rubber material . . . and it seems 
to have worked. And my next venture is to just purchase a new mesh seat. 
But I'm curious to see if anyone else has had the same problem.

Yes, and the solution for me was to re-apply the seat mesh paying much
more attention to both getting it crease-free on top and making sure there
wasn't anything poking up under the seat (I had a cable tie in a poor
location and the ~1mm edge was annoying me). With one trike I ended up
adding ties between the front of the mesh and the seat supports to stop
the mesh sliding up over time. I didn't bleed from it though.

With my rotovelo I've redone the seat padding to match the curve of my
back better (it's easy to stuff extra foam under the supplied pad), and
now that I've done that I'm thinking about putting a lower back pad
between the mesh and shock cord on my next mesh seat. It won't be as
effective as reshaping the seat supports, but it's a lot easier to do.

I found it was easier to just lace those parts separately. It's very easy
to pick a dividing point and end up with a knot at the front of the seat
and another at the top. I found that was especially useful on more upright
seats where the force on them is quite different.

Hi Jules,

I had a similar problem with the carbon seat on my Evo-K, but this was =
fixed by drilling a hole in the seat so there was no material pressing =
against the rub spot...
And then improved by adding a ventisit cushion.

It might be worth it to take it to a local shop that services trikes if you 
 have one nearby.  Bleeding is no fun!!!

The other day, after a fairly  short 10 mile ride on my GTO, I noticed a 
chafing on my bottom, in the  center, just above my sit bones. And the 
next morning, after scratching  the area (because it had become itchy), I 
discovered that my underpants  were extremely bloody. I have previously 
felt chafing in the same spot,  but it never was this bad, and it never 
before bled.

I may have an  explanation for this unpleasant condition: a year ago, the 
elastic that  held the mesh seat in place broke, and I repaired it with 
some bungee cord  I purchased from a sports shop. However, I don't think 
I did a great job:  the mesh eventually folded over itself in a couple of 
places, INCLUDING  EXACTLY WHERE THE CHAFING OCCURRED. A photo of the 
seat (showing the  wrinkling) is attached.

Has anyone else had the same problem? For the  time being, my "cure" is 
to cover the seat with some yoga mat rubber  material . . . and it seems 
to have worked. And my next venture is to just  purchase a new mesh seat. 
But I'm curious to see if anyone else has had  the same  problem.

Yes, and the solution for me was to re-apply the seat  mesh paying much
more attention to both getting it crease-free on top and  making sure there
wasn't anything poking up under the seat (I had a cable  tie in a poor
location and the ~1mm edge was annoying me). With one trike I  ended up
adding ties between the front of the mesh and the seat supports to  stop
the mesh sliding up over time. I didn't bleed from it  though.

With my rotovelo I've redone the seat padding to match the  curve of my
back better (it's easy to stuff extra foam under the supplied  pad), and
now that I've done that I'm thinking about putting a lower back  pad
between the mesh and shock cord on my next mesh seat. It won't be  as
effective as reshaping the seat supports, but it's a lot easier to  do.

Personally, I feel the need for a gap  between the back and the base of a 
seat.  The GS seat does not work for  me at all. If I felt the need to try to 
make it work, I would think about  trying to make the mesh into two pieces; 
back and base.

I found it was easier to  just lace those parts separately. It's very easy
to pick a dividing point  and end up with a knot at the front of the seat
and another at the top. I  found that was especially useful on more upright
seats where the force on  them is quite  different.

I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem with Dura-Ace
9-Speed bar end shifters.

Story follows:
Have had my Greenspeed-GTO since 2005.  In 2010 the rear shifter was
replaced after replacing all the other rear drive components. I purchased
the shifter from a LBS (Inside Out Sports) and got it adjusted to shift OK
without too many problems.    I find that with recumbents the adjustment of
the shifter is a real pain because you cannot turn the crank and see what
is happening at the cogs at the same time -- maybe someone has a solution
for this -- I have thought of a mirror, a video camera or a small motor to
slowly turn the crank.

So, after about 50 to 100 miles of riding with everything going well the
shifter suddenly lost its indexing.  I decided to fix it after letting is
sit for a few months over the hot summer we have had in NC.  When I removed
the shifter I noticed that the plastic cover was cracked and when fully
removed the small circular indexing plate fell out in two pieces.  This
seems to explain why the indexing failed.  I went back the to the LBS and
asked if there was any warranty.  They were not too encouraging about a
warranty and did not have a new set in stock.  So I ordered a new set from
Amazon. The box and parts from Amazon appeared to be genuine Shimano.  I
found with this unit that I could not find an adjustment that would allow
good shifting for both small and large cogs.  I removed the chain and
looked at the alignment at each index point and found that the derailleur
was not stepping correctly.  Also noticed that the shifter seemed to have
10 index points rather than 9.   After several attempts to see if there was
some compromise adjustment I gave up.

 Then decided that since I did not really know what indexing Shimano was
using, I would setup a fixture to try to find out.  Clamped the shifter in
a vise and connected a short piece of housing and ran a cable which was
suspending a weight of about 8 lbs.  The value of 8 lbs was found by using
a spring scale to pull on the shifter cable with no chain -- I found that
it took about 8-10lbs to move the derailleur and about 5 lbs to hold at a
fixed position.  Then clamped a small pointer on the cable and marked the
index points with a fine pen.  I was surprised to find that there really
were 10 index points and that there was noticeable hysteresis when shifting
in opposite directions.  The inner steps were about 0.1" but the end steps
were about 0.15".  Gave up and thought about changing to SRAM Grip-Shift,
but would have to change the derailleur also.

Then about a week after contacting the LBS they said they had a new set of
shifters for warranty replacement. The first thing I did was to setup the
new shifter in the fixture I had made to compare the indexing of the unit
from Amazon.  This new shifter looked much better. The hysteresis was much
smaller and there were 9 index positions.  I still saw that the indexing at
the end points was larger at the ends.  About 0.15" for 9-8 and about 0.13"
for 1-2.  I guess this is a design feature.  So, installed this unit and
after a bit of fiddling with the adjustment was able to get shifting to
work well.

Has anyone had a similar experience?  I have always expected very high
standards from Shimano.

Bob,
One aid is a pedal stick that connects to a pedal shaft and allows you to
spin the cranks while shifting and observing the derailleurs. I use one
with my WAW velomobile.   It looks like an animal control stick.

Its a 40" piece of 1/2" ID plastic pipe with 60"of parachute cord fed
through it. The pedal end  has a small hole in the side of the pipe for the
cord. The cord is knotted so it can't slip out. The other end of the pipe
has a saw kerf slot just large enough for the cord.  In use a pedal sized
loop of cord is created at the pedal end and slipped over the pedal to the
axle. At the other end of the stick, the slack is pulled out of the cord. A
strategically located knot is slipped into the cord slot to keep the cord
under tension.

The pipe can be any length to suit your application.

Hi Bob,
Shimano bar end shifters have been sold in 8, 9 and 10sp versions... And =
seem to alternate between Dura Ace and Ultegra ranges. There is usually =
one more 'click' than the number of gears they're set up for. See =
Sheldon Brown for spacings for each type - perhaps you managed to get =
the wrong gear version (possibly wrongly marked/advertised?) and it =
didn't match the rest of your setup?
As the shifting mechanism moves along an arc I guess I'd expect the =
amount of lateral movement for a given amount of cable pull to vary, =
especially at the extreme limits but I've never bothered measuring it. =
Usually the 'end' gears are up against the rear mech stops so it isn't =
so critical.
When working alone, rear wheel up on chocks,  set gear and pedal up =
front, then go back and check - but yeah, it is easier with an =
assistant...
Rob

Last time I wanted to change my bar end levers I bought Shimano down =
tube levers for GBP30/US45...
They are a little rare but the ones I picked up had the same type of =
click-ring, fitted straight on to the bar end lever mounts and the =
levers themselves were all metal and much nicer. Watch out tho as some =
have curved click rings that wrap around the downtube.

When I had a derauler, I would find a helper (children can and enjoy being part of this) to turn the crank.  If you have a BB style with an internal thread, you may be able to install a long bolt, to which you attach an electric drill, to turn it, while you adjust. 
  I use an IGH (Alfine 11 speed) so it&#39;s now moot.

 For no apparent reason, several years ago the (Shimano) indexing plate on
my TT 3.4 crumbled into far more than two pieces.  Both front and rear.  I
pulled apart the bar-ends, dug out the remaining pieces and put them back
together.  I am still riding it and haven't missed the clicks.  I suppose
there is some theoretical downside to this smooth shifting, but I haven't
noticed it in practice.

Even when new, it was not easy to get all 27 gears to stay properly
indexed.  Now I can adjust to get all gears without worrying about clicks.
 It only takes a short time to become accustomed to the sound and feel of
properly shifting gears.

The TT is old and beatup enough now to need a complete overhaul this
winter.  Anyone know of better shifters - click or clickless?

Thanks to all for the responses and  the info.

The pedal stick sounds like a good solution.

Thanks for reminding me of the Sheldon Brown site -- with all the people
the world could do without, why did he have to pass-away?

The bent rider online info showed this is not an uncommon problem.  Sorry
to see that the 9-speed Dura-Ace is obsolete.

I do not remember too well,  but I think I tried to put the shifter in
friction mode when indexing broke, but it did not work well.   Really like
indexing.

I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem with Dura-Ace
9-Speed bar end shifters.

Story follows:
Have had my Greenspeed-GTO since 2005.  In 2010 the rear shifter was
replaced after replacing all the other rear drive components. I purchased
the shifter from a LBS (Inside Out Sports) and got it adjusted to shift OK
without too many problems.    I find that with recumbents the adjustment of
the shifter is a real pain because you cannot turn the crank and see what
is happening at the cogs at the same time -- maybe someone has a solution
for this -- I have thought of a mirror, a video camera or a small motor to
slowly turn the crank.

So, after about 50 to 100 miles of riding with everything going well the
shifter suddenly lost its indexing.  I decided to fix it after letting is
sit for a few months over the hot summer we have had in NC.  When I removed
the shifter I noticed that the plastic cover was cracked and when fully
removed the small circular indexing plate fell out in two pieces.  This
seems to explain why the indexing failed.  I went back the to the LBS and
asked if there was any warranty.  They were not too encouraging about a
warranty and did not have a new set in stock.  So I ordered a new set from
Amazon. The box and parts from Amazon appeared to be genuine Shimano.  I
found with this unit that I could not find an adjustment that would allow
good shifting for both small and large cogs.  I removed the chain and
looked at the alignment at each index point and found that the derailleur
was not stepping correctly.  Also noticed that the shifter seemed to have
10 index points rather than 9.   After several attempts to see if there was
some compromise adjustment I gave up.

 Then decided that since I did not really know what indexing Shimano was
using, I would setup a fixture to try to find out.  Clamped the shifter in
a vise and connected a short piece of housing and ran a cable which was
suspending a weight of about 8 lbs.  The value of 8 lbs was found by using
a spring scale to pull on the shifter cable with no chain -- I found that
it took about 8-10lbs to move the derailleur and about 5 lbs to hold at a
fixed position.  Then clamped a small pointer on the cable and marked the
index points with a fine pen.  I was surprised to find that there really
were 10 index points and that there was noticeable hysteresis when shifting
in opposite directions.  The inner steps were about 0.1" but the end steps
were about 0.15".  Gave up and thought about changing to SRAM Grip-Shift,
but would have to change the derailleur also.

Then about a week after contacting the LBS they said they had a new set of
shifters for warranty replacement. The first thing I did was to setup the
new shifter in the fixture I had made to compare the indexing of the unit
from Amazon.  This new shifter looked much better. The hysteresis was much
smaller and there were 9 index positions.  I still saw that the indexing at
the end points was larger at the ends.  About 0.15" for 9-8 and about 0.13"
for 1-2.  I guess this is a design feature.  So, installed this unit and
after a bit of fiddling with the adjustment was able to get shifting to
work well.

Has anyone had a similar experience?  I have always expected very high
standards from Shimano.

Has anyone had any experience with heated gloves? The older I get, the 
colder my fingers get whenever it's below freezing. And since I ride 
throughout the winter, I spend a lot of time with frigid digits.

Any help will be appreciated.

I use Gerbing gloves, both for my motorcycle (12V) and my trike (7V). =
Not cheap but worth every penny. I hate cold hands (and so does The =
Madam).

Hi all,

Long time, not write.

I hope SWMBO will go along with this and let me buy one and be a beta
tester for them - an ELF from Organic Transit, made nearby in Durham NC:

http://www.organictransit.com/models.html

http://www.youtube.com/otvehicles

There isn't anything really new about it, but they have combined what is
out there nicely.

I think I can really make good use of one.  My commute is 23.5 miles each
way.  More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much time.

This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if that
is at full, electric only, speed.  But, it should be fine with a lets and
battery power.   It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall current
in two hours.  So I can easily get to work and back.  It will go a lot
faster than 20mph with leg power.  I might maintain 25mph or more for the
trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter trike.
 It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.  I don't know if it is geared
for higher.

Happy nNew Year,

Mike

is there some law in the usa
against a 4-wheeled thing that looks like a sports car,
but weighs only 100 lb ?
why do you suppose that is?

...

thank you for pointing out
where I needed to clarify myself;
I meant a dual-use motor-assisted hpv;
it is the motor assistance that causes problems;
there are many laws concerning safety
but they don't apply to motor bikes,
so to skirt the safety laws
a motor-assisted hpv needs to stay like a motorbike
-- not fully enclosed,
and not more than 3 wheels .
. freedom means being able to buy a
fully-enclosed 4-wheeled sports car
that weighs only 100 lb
-- one I can pedal on flat ground in a school zone,
but then run a motor to keep up with 35mph zones .
. trikes interest me only because they
support velomobile designs
http://amerdreamduh.blogspot.com/p/velomobile.html
and they can provide high stability
even in high winds .
. just looking at the organictransit models
made feel as if I was going to flip over!
. if people would keep their cars under 100lb,
there wouldn't be any need for licenses or insurance .

wouldn't it be fairer to determine this by weight class

In general, if it has three wheels, it is usually considered as a
motorcycle. If it has 4 wheels, it is a car, and is subject to all the
safety regulations. Seat belts, bumpers, lights, etc.

The motorcycle and sidecar combination had to stay wedged into the  
regulations due to their continued sales after the other cyclecars  
fell out of favour.  A few countries still offer reduced taxes on  
smaller cars, but there have been no true microcars to consider.   
Also, lawmakers are neither particularly smart no worried about you.

You are all lucky in the USA - here in Australia we instinctively make 
laws against anything that is fun, interesting or useful. Since 
power-assisted bikes/trikes fall into all three categories, and also 
deprive the oil industry of much needed revenue, their manufacture here 
is a stillborn industry.

Yeah, I remember how the helmet laws cut bike ridership in OZ by 80% or so.

Do they actually enforce stuff there?  That is one of the neat things in
NC, all sorts of things run around unlicensed. I presume the coppers have
more important fish to fry. I had a scooter pace me up a hilly at 40mph+ a
couple weeks ago.  Hard to figure why that isn't a motorcycle.

Folks trundle around on public roads with there golf carts, four wheelers
are brazen.

Most people don't know electric assist when they see it.  So you could
cobble most anything together here.  It is when you try to market in volume
that it gets tricky.

They don't enforce usually. But they certainly can, even though the law 
is unenforceable at it stands. The 200 watt limit ensures electric 
assists never become useful car-replacements.

The law in Oz has changed recently. Already in in most states . WA and 
SA I think still to go.

The new law is the Euro standard. 250W , speed cutout at 25 kmh and 
works via pedalling. No throttle.

The new laws in Oz will affect some bike shops, and the people
importing from Europe will love them. But the people importing from
China/Asia don't care because they don't follow them. It's easy to buy
a "bicycle" here that has a 400W motor, throttle and decorative
pedals. For under $1000. Spend a bit more and you often get something
with less power (and smaller but still entirely imaginary chance of
being prosecuted).

The real issue is the IC powered ones, with poorly made two stroke
engines bolted to poorly made bicycles. People ride them on the
off-road shared paths with no regard for basically anything. The
problem is getting worse because, again, they're being brought in and
sold cheaply as bicycles.

Michael Ross said:
> Yeah, I remember how the helmet laws cut bike ridership in OZ by 80% or so.

50%, ish. Death rate went up to compensate though, so we have fewer
deaths but the remaining cyclists have a greater chance of dying.
Numbers today are greater than before helmets, just because cycling
numbers are growing pretty darn fast.

> Do they actually enforce stuff there?

Some things, yes. Helmet laws, for example. Power assist laws they
don't even try because it requires training to be able to tell (and
even then it really requires a lab test). With the electric ones I can
sympathise, most of them are "one less car" and many motors are "X
watts at Y volts" so who really knows anyway.



One useful thing with the rule change is that it makes power assisted
velomobiles much safer. Having more power but cutting out at 25kph
means that stuff like the Trisled Avatar will be less able to reach
the 80kph or so on the flat that a fit rider with 200W power assist
should be able to manage. Of course, they're now more likely to be
pulled over to check :)

One of Ben@Trisled's concerns is that a US-legal 500W motor could
easily push his velomobiles to speeds they're not really designed to
crash at. He's more about "200W gets you 50kph" because that's what a
reasonably fit cyclist should be able to put out unassisted.

Luckily the linked vehicles are built for the other end of the speed
spectrum :)

Riding my velo around I keep thinking I don't want power assist so
much as "kick me up to speed" assist. I'm thinking a small
RC-helicopter style motor that's only good for 30s at a time, but that
would get me to 30kph or so much faster that I can do it by myself.
Combines with a smallish power pack from RC toys, it could make for a
very lightweight addition. I'm also looking at the disk rotor mount of
the Rohloff and wondering about using that.

I vaguely recall one of the CF lowracer guys having built one but
can't recall the details.

Is anyone doing this, or better, making a kit?

I'd say something like a Stokemonkey setup. Lots of large cheap motors and
lithium batteries.
Try hobbyking.com for motors, batteries and charges. Should be able to
build a nice assist motor but at a fraction of the size.
Biggest problem would be adapting a freewheel or similar to the smaller
electric motor shaft. Easily doable on a lathe....
Check it out.
http://clevercycles.com/blog/products/stokemonkey/
We are getting a new cnc router at work this month. I might get a chance to
cut some aluminum brackets to mount motor to frame with support for a frame.
Check out http://www.ecalc.ch/motorcalc_e.htm if you really want to go with
a prop type drive.
Any question feel free to ask :)
Cheers,
Paul

Haven't been looking much at the HPV sites lately. Johns type of drive is
kinda like what I was thinking with the stokemonkey simplicity.

That seems very like what I was remembering, but I'm sure I saw one on
a bike. Anyway, that's what I want :) Thanks for the link!

The OT velo is using RC stuff, but I don't know any specifics.  If I did
know I would need to keep quiet because I've done the preliminary paperwork
to be a beta tester.  NDA signed and all that.

If you look at the Team <http://www.organictransit.com/team.html> link on
the OT website you will see the founders are all pretty well set with bona
fides.  I have met Rob Cotter.  He seems pretty sharp.  Not a novice.

The UK/EU limit for electric bikes is also 200W, but that's the limit for
bikes that legally count (for almost all purposes) as pedal bikes, and can
be ridden without insurance, without a driving test or licence, etc..
It that the same in Australia?

200W is closer to an elite athlete's average power output than a typical
cyclist, so _if it was used efficiently_ would already be pushing the limits
of being an "assist" rather than an electric powered vehicle.
(Though electric assist bikes can't keep that power output up for anything
like, say, the whole of a Tour de France stage.)

http://www.atob.org.uk/electric-motorbikes-scooters/electric-motorbike-scooter-licensing-laws/
https://www.gov.uk/electric-bike-rules
http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/electric-bikes-and-the-law-29969/

But if a "useful car-replacement" can e.g. carry four people like a typical
car, it's going to need a sizeable motor, not just an assist. Many people
do use cars for journeys that could sensibly be done by bike, and in some
cases an assist might encourage that, but that replaces some fraction of
car journeys rather than really being a replacement for a car.

Getting light electric vehicles on the road legally is much trickier, but
having car-replacements legislated as cars doesn't seem unreasonable.

. here are some (untested) motor links
http://www.electrathonamerica.org/Resource_Links.html
(from a source I'm betting won't let you down).
. one great thing about Organic Transit
is the site's inclusion of a real designer:
C. Michael Lewis claims the title for building
the World's Most Efficient Electric Vehicle.
. his intro has links to electrathonamerica.org
http://www.electrathonamerica.org/Welcome_to_Electrathon_America.html
where every car is built efficiently
http://www.electrathonamerica.org/News.html
and some look like real vehicles,
not politically correct bugs .
. sit up straight like your mama said ...
. I do like their TruckIt however
because it's a nice motorhome not just a vehicle !
(USA capitalists sent my job to china,
then USA bankers took my house,
I live in my TruckIT now, outside of USA city limits... )
.. alas, that OT model you cannot buy,
because it's still in development.

Carrying a 60 Watt panel around does not make a velomobil "solar powered" an=
d trickle charging a lithium battery is a really bad idea and on the dangero=
us side.
A 60W panel generates 45-50W/day, so all it will do is feeding your lights o=
r phones for some time, but compare this to the 750 W electric assist.. (and=
 the panel is 12V, the motor 36 or more..) -
 better to leave the panel at home and win on less weight..

. safety laws are still hindering efficiency;
because when you enter the family car class
you add 100's of pounds of crash-proofing ...
the key to safety is remembering Natural law;
people cannot not trust green lights,
so we need to replace them with radials,
or more limited-access arrangements .
. in the meantime, we should also promote
air-conditioned full-face helmets,
that have a vest system
that includes a spine protection system .
. it also has a forced air hepa carbon filter
to help you ride cleanly in the smog .
. it is perched on the spine&kidney support
so you hardly feel it except when turning your head .

My thoughts exactly.  The two in the back sort of creeps me out when you
can just do two in the front.

However, I have seen Ketts handle really well, so low CG may mitigate a lot
of this trouble.   There is nothing to say they can't get the CG low on the
TruckIT if they work at it. Cushman had a going concern making little yard
dogs and delivery vans in delta configuration.

I am not sure yet why anyone would sniff or sneeze at the ELF.  It may be
very good at the sort of urban noodling and shopping they are marketing it
for.  A bit pricey for all that, but still it does have merit - having
ridden one.   It seems to be popular, and that in itself is important.  I
wonder if Lewis has actually driven an ELF.

Over 200W and it has to be registered. Impossible with any sort of 
bicycle-based device, and even with the right gear it's a 
legal/engineering minefield. On the plus side, there are well-defined 
pathways for getting EV conversions registered, so the law is being 
sensibly administered there.

By "useful car replacement" I meant something that could carry you and 
some shopping without compromising handling and braking. Weather 
protection (e.g. a velo) would be a definite plus.

@Lui,
sorry if you didn't find affection in my
razz about USA's ways of doing things;
I don't live on the street,
and the TruckIt is not my thing;
but, are you sure about 60W panel size?
that is for the Elf not the TruckIt .
. and what makes you think it's dangerous?
don't trust a USA regulator? ;) .

The 60W panel currently being put on the OT ELF doesn't weight a half a
kilo.    They are working on sourcing a 120W panel, slight better, and some
what longer and wider as I understand it.  If that doubles  which is not an
entirely unreasonable wish for the future, you really have something.

60W is fine to charge fully during a work day if the sun is bright.  But
you would need to plug in overnight if commuting.  For my commute the cost
of plugged power would be $0.10 versus $5 to put gas in my car.  Wear and
tear comparison is bound to be better as well.  Not bad.

Incorrect charging will indeed cause problems with Li cells, but it is also
possible to do it correctly.

Put this question to yourself: should I use everyone else to attain
happiness, or should I help others gain happiness?
*Dalai Lama *

To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.

A public-opinion poll is no substitute for thought.

You like to make provocative statements.  I must ask you to defend them a
bit.

"From an ecological view charging the vehicle from plug means coal, oil,
gas, atomic plants as energy source plus conversion and line losses; would
be interesting how much oil has to be burnt for a full charge of the pack."

I suspect that the $0.10 or so I have to pay for a kilowatt hour really is
the cost of the power - plus some profit.  The local utilities are not in
the habit of giving their product away for free.

"> 60W is fine to charge fully during a work day if the sun is bright.  But

Yes nice, but it would not drive the trike.."

I really don't understand your comment.   The battery pack holds 480Watt
hours so a kWh ought to charge it

<http://www.organictransit.com/models.html>
Specs:  http://www.organictransit.com/models.html

That provides 30 miles of assistance (I am not sure how that is portioned
out pedal work vs battery work).  I believe this is already proven.  They
have been built and tested.  So on what basis do you challenge this?

"> Incorrect charging will indeed cause problems with Li cells, but it is
also

Not with trickle charging Li batteries."

Again, I am not following your thought process here.  I am not sure how you
mean trickle charging.

There is a charge controller used to properly manage battery charging.
 Perhaps this is different from whatever you mean by trickle charging.

It is pretty clear that Li batteries can be charged so that there are no
problems. Why do you think it is not possible for this system to do
likewise?

Or are you just saying that the OT people must be lying?  You should have
some valid basis for that other than opinion.

Are you privy to the specifications of systems implemented on this machine?

Are you aware of some technological reason why they cannot be charged
correctly from a solar cell, whether it be 60W, 120W, or 240W?

MIke

scuse me for butting in, but the best info on making fast e-bicycles is on a forum with a weird name - endlesssphere

They are using the 2K-6K Turnigy motors and others on bicycles. Its hard to keep them cool, but you get a lot of power
out of a small package. There is a lot of experimentation there, a huge amount really. Guys are racing them at kart
tracks and beating the gas bikes.

check it out.

I was talking about my own cost.  I will get payback in pretty decent time
if the thing functions as planned.  it will cost me about $0.10 to charge
it once by wall current and if I park it on a sunny day while I work it
will charge just fine for free.  Compare that to my gas cost to drive my
car of about $5 at today's prices give or take a bit.


  Its called solar-electric and this is, ahem, misleading because it runs

Please don't get snotty, there is no reason for that.  You read something
into this that I never said.
But, it IS solar and electric, if you plug in some times, and you leave it
in the sun other times, it will charge either way.

It is has a 60W cell right now.  And it is set up to be plugged in as the
main source of power.  If you park it for 7 hours they on a roughly
1000W/m^2 day you will get a full charge (we get 1300W/m^2 but it probably
averages out lower depending on what you define as a day for averaging).

60W cell, that clearly will not work as the sole source if you ride beyond
30miles plus whatever is offset by pedaling.   OT thinks that 240 watts
from a mounted solar cell is possible in the future.  At that rate you
would only need wall power it it is overcast.  That seems like a reasonable
statement to me.  There is already room for a 120W panel on it.

By your definition then, the OT ELF is not trickle charged.  It is a
controlled charge.  There should be no problems letting the sun charge
it because the process is manged to keep the batteries healthy.

If I ever said it was trickle charged (I do not believe I did), then I
misspoke.

Its not you, in all the writing about Elf and TruckIt you will find the "sol=

Charging a 48 V battery with a 12V Panel > step up converter> losses 20%, ch=
arging a lithium battery 10-30 % losses on primary energy, depending on temp=

With the earnings from a 60W panel you can fire up two  10 W lamps for 2 hou=

 solar. our house runs on it since 1987..

The EU limit is 250 W and max speed with e-assistance 25 km/h.

HI all,


 I finally have my ELF and some time to mess with it.  I thought y'all
might like to hear a little about it.  I can't be to revealing because I
signed an NDA and got a deal to do beta testing (log comments essentially).

I said some things that were probably based on old information from a
website that needed cleaning up, and from comments by people who probably
should have been more circumspect or silent.

here's  what I said at first:

"I think I can really make good use of one.  My commute is 23.5 miles each
way.  More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much time.

This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if that
is at full, electric only, speed.  But, it should be fine with a legs and
battery power.   It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall current
in two hours.  So I can easily get to work and back.  It will go a lot
faster than 20mph with leg power.  I might maintain 25mph or more for the
trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter trike.
 It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.  I don't know if it is geared
for higher."

I still think I will be able to make the commute, but I will have to regain
some fitness.  Yesterday I went shopping and to a brewery for a beer.  The
first leg I averaged 21.7mph, hit 34.4mph on one hill, then I moseyed
around for a little while socializing, bought a gallon of juice, and 4 lb
of popcorn, and headed home.  Final average speed was 19mph.  14 miles
total.  Seemed like I worked pretty hard.  The trike weighs 120lb and I am
currently just under 260. I had an extra battery I did not use (13.4lb),
and jug of water.  I have made some other shorter ride, one at night.

The comment about 30 miles without pedaling, is not something I can get.
 Maybe a small person in flat country, a best case scenario.  I see claims
like that are completely absent t from  the website now.  I can't see
anything they are saying that I would disagree with now.  I think it is all
the claim it is.  But less than I was claiming.  I heard I would recharge
in 2 hours, but the charger they gave me took twice that.  I am not sure of
the state of charge after my ride.  I believe it is a 10Ah battery LiFePO4.

It is stoutly made and not light. So far I think it seems like a very good
first attempt.  It rides quite nicely and felt very confident at 30+mph.
Some times it cuts off hard (going down as fast as possible), one time I
was cruising at 25mph and still getting some help, I think because the
acceleration was low?  It won't give much help unless I gear it differently
or hack something.  I have had to revise my hopes for a 30mph commute down
a lot., BUt maybe I can average 22 fairly soon.


Earlier Bob Stuart made some comments back channel and I thought you all
might be interested in them and how I find the ELF in that regard.

BS:
Why do you think it will go faster with leg power?  The booster cuts out,
leaving you on your own over 20 MPH, and probably unable to maintain 21.
 You'd need a major downhill to see 40.

MR:Right on the money.  But I think I can keep it up above 21.

BS:
I see seven videos to choose from, and no contrary claims for speed.  If it
is fast, they'd brag, not hint.  These things are usually very hackable.
 The 20 MPH limit is sometimes imposed by a jumper wire that can be moved
according to market.  As long as you are visibly pedaling, the police
usually have something else to worry about.

MR: I think it can be done with  a PC.  (Kelly Controls)

My guess would be that without a booster, you would not be able to maintain
the speed you get from a plain bicycle.  Given how easy streamlining is,
I'd expect to get at least a third more speed from any rainproof enclosure,
so to me, adding power is like throwing hardware at a software problem.
 Legally, it is the only way to cruise over 20.  However, the first thing
I'd want to change is the motor control.  A separate switch makes a pedelec
feel like a woefully underpowered regular vehicle.  A pedal-force
multiplier, OTOH, can use the same power that makes you a frustrated
motorist and make you feel like a superman on pedals.  At these power
levels, that gets more important, as your own contribution otherwise feels
insignificant, and you don't even get your exercise motivation.

MR:I am doing OK with the thumb accelerator, but the idea of a pedal switch
is interesting.  I would need an override for it.

You don't want to feel as if you are riding an exercycle on display in an
awkward little cart, disrupting traffic.  All the green points available to
man don't make that look cool.

MR: Well, it is an exercycle to me...but I am not cool.  This isn't an
awkward cart though, it is a pretty good trike.  I have a good route, low
density, 45mph limit.

BS: At these price levels, you also want to check on durability and
serviceability,

MR: So far I am pretty happy with it.  It is well built.  Maybe some trim
component issues.

BS: and ask yourself if you will be able to put up with the drum-like road
noise amplification over the long haul.  Try to get a decibel reading, and
ponder the enormous health and productivity gains realized by efforts to
quiet down offices.  Would you be safe with noise-canceling headphones on?

MR: It isn't noisy enough that I can remember except on rough pavement.  IT
is doorless and that seems like a goo compromise.  The breeze is OK for
moderate temps that I have seen, side winds aren't an issue so far, and it
doesn't sound like being in a barrel or anything.

BS:
Your numbers don't add up.  The power required at 30 mph is double to
triple what you need at 20.

MS: I am in total agreement, now.  Maybe with some hot rodding and shorter
cranks... The ride is half down hill, half uphill, so maybe I can make up
some time on the downsides.

Bob also brought up lighting controls, ELF has an OK handle bar switch for
headlamps, turns,LEDs, and a horn relay so these switches see little power.
 May be OK wait and see.  Brake lights from a disc brake mounted switch
(have not looked close at that)  I think I want a dash to reduce reflection
from below.  Some black fabric can do that. And, I just like more forward
light so will do more there.

That's all for now.  I just wanted to correct some things I said that were
incorrect or dated.

Thanks for all past and future comments.

Mike

No replies this time, that is odd.

I have a couple hundred miles on the ELF now.   I can do my commute and it
isn't bad at all.  I can average about 21.5mph for the 24 mile trip.  This
is with my husbanding resources, both mine and the batteries.  I get 14
miles from one allegedly 9Ah battery.  I believe with more fitness I will
be able to average 23mph. Part of it will be learning how to use the
batteries best.  I have some power to spare, but I am making sure I don't
run out.  It is much too heavy for unassisted pedaling on inclines.

I really do want some shorter cranks, I just can't spin 175mm ones as well
as I like.

I like it, I can get where I need to go quickly enough, it takes off at
lights and crest hills so much better than I can do on a non-assisted
xxcycle.  The exercise is at a really good level.  I can maintain a good
level of work and I don't blow up on hills.  I am more liable to over
extend on slight downhills where I turn the transmission all the way up and
work as hard as I can for the cadence.  But, I can rest and use the motor,
then work some more.

I am pretty happy with it.  It does what they say. If you are hearty you
can do more.

There are some fragility issues with bodywork, but any HPV has to work at
the edge of durability to keep weight down.

Mike

I have ridden at night, and the wind screen was to reflective of the
interior and ground and I have a hard time seeing the road.  But I made a
dash board that does the trick.  I have already started depending on it for
towels, a hat, a flashlight, and a water bottle.

Hi Mike

What is the ELF like in rain? Are you keeping dry enough with the open
design of the body?

Does the front screen keep clear enough to see or do you need some sort of
wiper?

Thanks

Derryl

Hi Sharon,

I don't have any way to answer that with accuracy.  Here, in Raleigh and
eastward to where I live are hills, that in my current state of fitness I
would not go up them more than 5 mph.  I seem to be able to go 17 or 18 mph
over the steepest ones I have seen in my limited travels.  I don't consider
these hills to be worthy of referencing with a percent grade designation;
however, it is not what I would call flat here either.  Geologically it is
the eastern piedmont, and it truly flat eastward from where I live.   IMO
we do not have very steep hills here.  What hills I have on my commute I
can top them at 20 mph or more.

I want to get longer battery milage so I do work at a sustainable hard
pace.  I am also overweight at 6 feet tall and 255 lb (and dropping), and
carry a fair amount of gear 20 lb? And 27 lb of batteries.

You can't tell how your own use will compare given all the variables that
are likely different.

Tell me where you live, how far you want to go, how fast, and how much you
and your gear weigh, and probably most important, your level of fitness,
past cycling experience, and willingness to work hard on your ride.  Then,
I might be able to hypothesize about what you can do.

It appears that we can get larger batteries online for considerably less
that the ones the ELF was built for - batteries that fit into the battery
tray or storage box in the back.  The suppliers are all Chinese (including
those that OT is using).  There is some risk in buying from these folks.
Their webpages are often poorly translated, not very clear, and with
some conflicting information.  For instance, the battery I have ordered is
listed as 9kg in one place and 12kg in another.

I think since my current 10 and 9 Amp hour batteries are 6 kg, that a 12 kg
battery  is more likely to be the quoted 20 Amp hours rather than the 9 kg
one.  I don't have a clear idea how any of these batteries are measured, if
at all.  I am prepared to find out I really have a 15 AMp hour battery
coming, it is still less expensive.

I have heard that beta testers who do not  contribute much, or no work at
all to the ELF can get about 6 miles between charges from a 9 AMp hour
battery.  I have gotten 18 miles at an average speed of 18 to 20 mph.  If I
go faster I sacrifice distance per charge.  If I go 23 mph on average, I
get maybe 12 miles.   I am working as hard as I am able.  On a regular
bicycle I might  be able to average 11 or 12 mph on these routes.

I think this is a very practical range of mileage and speed, but you must
not over do what you have battery power to cover or you will be stuck.
 Take you cell phone, and know someone with a truck, or be conservative.

I get more from the 10 Amp hour battery I have which is apparently
significantly more expensive for the function it provides than the 9 Amp
hour ones.

We should all be sharing notes on battery prices and suppliers, as this is
the main contributor to the utility of the ELF.  On any kind of incline it
is much too heavy for unassisted pedalling.

I don't know if we should keep using the trikes list, as some people don't
like to here about electric assist.  On the other hand, there is no other
conversation here, so I am not sure why anyone would care.  There are
probably better lists and forums to join.

 Started this thread in this list because there are people here whose
opinions I really respect and trust.

Mike

I live in West Orange and have two grandkids that love to ride their 
bikes. Trouble is, there are not many safe places that allow bikes to 
roam free.

Does anyone have a good idea where I can take them for a family ride?

Thanks in advance,

Jules

I want to add a chain tensioner for my OT ELF.  Jockey wheel can take up
more chain so that seems to make more sense.

I guess my priorities are starting high:

good recs
durable
rebuildable
cost

Thanks all, hope your silence is not a sign of demise.

Mike

I'm sorry, I don't understand the term "recs."  I'm not familiar with  
the OT ELF, either - I'll just assume it is similar to most tadpoles.  
Part of a junked rear derailleur can be hacked to do the basic job,  
but trike chains are subject to side forces and shaking that can  
throw a chain off, so it helps to add guides to the roller cage.   
Standard 8t derailleur jockey pulleys are high-friction.  If there is  
room for larger idlers, that is better, as are ball bearing centers.

After many years of avocation (work more than I care to count) I have a
version of a reasonable Tilting trike system or TTW. It works mainly as a
tadpole but would work as a delta also. 

 

My concept is a machine where you are a non tilting trike at low speed and
you are a virtual bicycle at high speed. In short you take off from a trike
transform to a enhanced bike and land back into a trike as a cycle.

 

This does not mean much unless you ride it. Video may help a little. I rode
Ice and Veloteknik suspended trikes at  the Midwest recumbent rally and see
and feel the type has advanced quite a bit. I think my TTW would compete
price wise if commercialized IMHO. The solution is a much simplified version
of the APAX. I will post a link to it if there is enough interest here.

 

Anyway I am canvassing to see if there is any imagination interest in this
concept at this time. It could work in velomobile and a natural for e- 

Bikes all challenging fields in themselves. The old saw of the TTW is to
combine the best of bike and trike dynamics for a net marketable gain. 

 

Best regards,

 

 

 

Wayne Soohoo

So...

I know about the Greenspeed X4 Rail HPV for garden railways, but has
anyone adapted a tadpole trike to a standard 4'8&1/2" railway?

     I have one of the original review Wiz Wheelz-Terra Trike 3.6 tadpole t=
rikes.  I wanted to hang it to free up floor space. Rather than hang from t=
he rear wheel with all the weight of the built up trike on the rear rim, I =
put up two hangers and hung the trike by the front wheels.  With a Zipper "=
Chopper" fairing on their three point mount and all the accessories on the =
trike and rear rack, it puts a lot less stress on the rims to hang from two=
 rims rather than one.  Fortunately the tires on my trike are right at 32 i=
nches center to center and with the wall studs 16 inches on center (16 inch=
es center to center) I was able to anchor the Terra Trike wall mounts into =
studs on both sides.  With an eight foot wall in the garage, the six foot l=
ong trike with accessories hangs just fine.  I roll the trike back to the w=
all with front facing away.  Lift to vertical, turn to face the wall, place=
 wheels close to the wall, slide to the left and lower to hang.   To remove=
 I lift slightly, slide to the right, turn half way around and set the trik=
e down facing away from the wall.  No need to remove anything and ready to =
ride at any time.

Wow, very nice elegant solution and very clear description of the
solution and procedure.  It even addresses the challenge of dealing with
a front fairing without scratching it.  Thank you!

I wouldn't be concerned for the rear rim as you are.  It is just not that
much weight.  Consider a Rhino Lite rim in a touring two wheeler.  A 240lb
rider and 60 lb of gear (as a Clydesdale this sounds reasonable) evenly
distributed is 150lb.  There is nothing inherently different about hanging
rather than resting on the wheel, except the touring bike has dynamic
loading that goes higher.

A 20 inch wheel is waaaay stronger.  My Greenspeed GTO weighs about 50lb
when I am not riding it.

I say just pad the thing you hang it from and be done.

I used to use a row of standard folding wall-mounted bike racks in my =
garage. These folded when not in use, when down they had a padded =91U=92 =
projecting into the garage space at maybe a 20=94 spacing. The =
crossmember of the trike sat on the arms nose towards the ceiling with =
all three wheels resting against the wall.

Cheers,

I like this idea ! Thanks.  It seems like it would avoid banging the front g=

Never one to take the "easy" way out, I went to my local Chinese Tool Store (aka Harbor Freight Tools) and bought one of their 440# capacity electric lifts.  At the time I had a Leitra and I built a flat platform out of plywood with chains and eyescrews attached so I could roll the trike onto the platform, attach 4 rings to the hook, and proceed to elevate the trike overhead.  I forst did this in the Automotive Shop of the high school where I taught.  Later I did this in my garage at home where I was able to raise the trike above my wife's minivan in between roof trusses 24" on center.

After selling the Leitra, I kept the lift (not the platform) and have stored my unfaired Taiwanese trike overhead using bungee-like cords with hooks attached to all 3 wheels.

We have since moved and I have taken the lift with me but have yet to install it -- too many other demands with the new house.

I once hung my Greenspeed tadpole by its rear wheel . . . and was=20
chagrined to find a slow leak of brownish water come dripping out of the =

main tube. Clearly the result of riding in a few too many rainstorms.

So a head's-up (though I should have expected it already): It may not be =

a bad idea to periodically take the trike apart, dry it out fully, and=20
coat the tubes with a rust preventative. Your LBS wrench should have=20
some ideas of how to apply the stuff.

Hi all,

I'd seen some mention of Greenspeed having trouble with their email
service...

I just had a bounce trying to email ian@ and info@ greenspeed.com.au.

Anyone know what's up?

I was thinking that...  I'm wondering what useful content I've posted in the
last several years...

Did I post about our "caterpillar"?  Our articulated camping touring rig for 4
recumbent pedallers?

We've got a bicycle night parade coming up here in Ottawa and I think I've
found another idea to match some of our previous zany ideas...

I did not see any such post if you did.  Sounds neat.  Bring it on.

I would be interested to know if you would do a second one, having
experienced the first.  Problems?  Is it more a novelty?  Or really useful?
 Limitations that are not obvious (like backing up)?

Mea Culpa.  Back in 1980, I'd have bet that there would be more slick  
magazines full of trike components than model aircraft mags by now.   
Instead, we are still struggling along with bicycle parts, sometimes  
putting the rear derailleur cage closer to the ground than the wheel  
rim.

What I've had on the drawing board for far too long is very  
different, and need not be expensive to make.  It takes into account  
the need to guide the chain against side forces, and rationalizes the  
whole affair for a RWD recumbent tadpole trike.  The chain tensioner  
has always been used to select rear cogs because it fits well there  
on a bike, but a simple cage, as on the front derailleur is more than  
adequate for the slack run.  The chain tensioner can be relocated  
closer to the middle of the run, to replace the idlers often used,   
and the moving idler can be just guided in a straight line by a  
couple of loose slots in the chain guard and a spring.  That provides  
plenty of take-up to run big, efficient chainrings and super-wide  
range gears for a streamliner.  Efficiency on the rear cogs falls off  
badly under 15t, and big front rings reduce the chain force, reducing  
wear and frame flex.  They even give more room for a Browning type  
shifter on the front, to work even under power, like the rear.

Bob,
I just encountered that situation on our Kowal tandem. Its a 2x20" ultra
short wheelbase tandem. 11x32 cassette, 60x48x36 chain rings.  The SRAM
Neos  RD wasn't shifting well and I couldn't remember how old it was. So I
bought a new MicroShift long cage RD. The cage was so long that it would be
dragging on the pavement in the event of a rear flat. The Neos is  a medium
cage unit. Amazing that it could shift that drive train as well as it did.
The problem appeared to be the lower jockey wheel  was missing a tooth. so
I adapted a Shimano jockey wheel to the Neos bearings. Cleaned and lubed.
Shifting well again.

Our Catrike Pocket has an SRAM XS RD (medium cage)  shifting 11x34 to
52x42x30.

When I tried to fit an 11x34 cassette on my WAW velomobile, the Shimano
Ultegra medium cage RD couldn't shift it. The B screw didn't have enough
adjustment. Since the rear wheel is 559, a long cage RD fit fine.

There may be a pattern here: does SRAM have more range than Shimano?

Fred

Sadly, Conrad Oho, the gearing wizard of Marin County who let  
mountain bikes go uphill as well as down, has left us.  However, I  
have usually found that a bit of judicious work with a file will  
usually get a useful increase in range, if necessary.

Speaking of clean and lubed  - a custom system with just a guide to  
the rear cluster could be made using light U - sections of bent  
Coroplast or other light sheet stock to drain oil back into a little  
bath at the lowest point.  It wouldn't be picking up bits of greenery  
on every trip off-road, either.

A file wouldn't have helped in this case. The B screw wasn't long enough
for the chain/jockey wheel to clear the largest cog. A longer screw slid
off the stop.

That link does not work for me, but I try to use the biggest idlers I  
can find room for, unless the chain only has to bend a few degrees,  
and there is no advantage to using two teeth to halve the degrees  
that each link has to move through.  This is much more important on  
the power side, with the link bearings under tension.  Jackshafts are  
a handy way to use available hardware, but are a significant tax on  
the power.

Yeah - it=92s the length between the bolt and top jockey wheel that you =
need to look at=85.
That top length needs to be tuned to the largest sprocket - the B-screw =
only fine tunes that distance.
=93Road=94 mechs are short in this dimension (aimed at, what 11-23, =
11-26 cassettes), MTB mechs tend to be longer (aimed at max 32, 34, 36t =
sprockets).
Then you select the lower cage length for the amount of take-up you =
need...

In your experience, do the higher chain velocities cost anything much? I 
was thinking of friction in guide tubes and things like that. I like big 
sprockets too, but was wondering about all that chain flying around.

I've never used chain tubes, but their power draw should be easy to  
calculate from the slope that they will slide on, their weight, and  
the chain speed.  I think that windage is negligible, since the feet  
are moving faster with any practical chainring size.
One possible problem with higher chain speeds is that the lowered  
tension does allow more sag from gravity, giving another source of  
"frame flex" pedal softness.  More or better spaced idlers may be  
indicated.

There is very little loss in a chain tube.  Polyethylene is a great choice,
low friction (not that is matters), very chemical resistant, low cost, easy
to find.   Once the chain is moving the friction is kinetic not static,
orders of magnitude lower.

I played around with a pull tester once and I could not get a reading - the
drag is minuscule.  The thing that matters is air resistance.  You can
probably save more by tucking in any loose straps.

Just like weight saving=85 I=92m 10 kilos down from last Fall. Not easy =

Reluctantly I am shutting down these lists soon.
The pipermail archives will remain online indefinitely.

hpv
hpv-forsale
hpv-boats
trikes
velomobile
vph

If someone wants to port any of them to another place I can provide you
with the subscriber list. Write to me directly if you want information.

Message volume is so low that I don't think it's worth the effort to move
them again.
