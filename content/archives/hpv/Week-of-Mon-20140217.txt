After too long a layoff due to multiple spine and knee surgeries, I'm
hoping to get on the road again -- once spring appears and the snow goes
away --  commuting to work (7 miles each way) here in Washington, DC

Before my injuries/surgery, I rode a RANS Rocket and then a RANS V-Rex.
Unfortunately, I cannot ride a two-wheeler, as my leg strength isn't yet
good enough to hold myself up and then get going when stopped.

I'm interested in trying a tricycle, even though they are pretty expensive
and possibly lower to the ground than I'd prefer.

Can anyone make a recommendation as to an affordable make/model? Again, my
objective is commuting. If it translates to a specific tricycle, in the
years commuted, the Rocket was a better choice than the V-Rex.

Thanks,
Eric Rosenberg

If leg strength is an issue I would suggest an old Trice and adding a Bionx
and a hub motor but only a small battery. Use the assist only when you are
starting or challenged by a hill. When your strength improves you can ditch
the e-assist stuff at only a small discount. Lower is better with a trike.
Lower is more stable and you shouldn't count on being seen as a commuter
... always ride as if that pleasant person smiling at you does not see you.
If you have not encountered this phenomenon, you will. As for getting up a
low trike, it is easy to do. Use the last of your momentum to propel your
body forward to a standing position. Easy and fun to do.

If your Rans rocket has the preferred riding position then you might want to
consider
a  LWB Delta trike  for your rehab.  The seats are higher. There are  reasonably
priced and  available.

Catrike has several models with upright seat angles. They are light tadpole
trikes. My wife can easily load her Pocket  in the back of the Outback.

this is a convenient list of styles and their prices;

like JWS said, Trice lets you make sharp defensive turns,
whereas affordable tadpoles are so tippy
they are no different than a delta trike .
I got my Trice from utahtrikes sent in a huge box preassembled!

Hi Eric.  I have had lots of bikes and trikes over the years.  I started with a Rans V-Rex Back in 1995.  I slowly aged and in 2011 I went total trike.  The Cat trikes and other tadpoles are hard to get out of.  My suggestion is a Delta.  I have a Hase and love it.  (I also still ride a TerraTrike).  At one point I put a Electric Wheel on my Hase.  It was great.   On the other hand an EZ-3 would be less expensive and would be a good commute bike as you are only going 7 miles each way.  It is also a little higher.  

I sent you an email with a couple of pictures and then remembered most people don?t open email with attachments from people they don?t know.

I would be glad to answer any questions and or send pictures.

.......They could be real easy to get out of if the manufactures would use a 
T bar system.

My old body has no problem at all getting up out of a seat 7 inches off the 
ground.

Agreed. T handles are easy to add to Catrikes.
