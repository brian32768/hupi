Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided
hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead, it
should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and
quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.
1 Peter 3:3-4 (NIV)

Yes, but please snip your quotes!! Excessive quoting in mailing lists wastes 
resources and makes the list difficult to read, search and archive.

Someone asked to be included in my reply about Zote source.  

I have dealt with 
Rubberlite in Huntington West Vergina  25728 
304 525 3116.
Like mst companies they have a minimum order of $300. 

That might sound like a lot but to build a shell you would need 
two pieces for the top (each piece is 30 x 40 inches so to cover say a 80 inch long shell you need 2 pieces). 

Then two for the bottom 
4 for the sides. 

All these  would be .5 inches thick of LD 45. You can order this stuff in any thickness. From paper thick to many inches. They slice it off a big cube.  Make sure you request no end pieces. These have a different finish. 

Its best to order extras of each color so if you do screw up you have spares. 

As an example I had to replace the top front section recently and I had the spare material on hand. 

You also need some HD 80 used for stiffeners. This you need say .1 thick. Only comes in black. 
 I also order a range of thickness just to have around. .125, .2 , and .5  Comes in handy.  

Average price is $25 to $30 per sheet. 

This might sound like a lot but it a hell of a lot less up front cost of composites +all the resins and throw away materials. 

Yes Zote is more expensive than CoroPlast but look at the difference in results. 
It takes a lot of my time to build something decent and I'm not about to use cheap materials. 
My time is worth a lot. 

John

Thanks John. This clarifies things greatly. I noticed that there is more than one type of zotefoam available. Which one do you use? I am assuming the evazote.

The local zotefoam distributor in Washington has a $100 minimum order.

Regarding rim width vs. tire width, a rule of thumb from Sutherland's 
Handbook is that the metric width of the tire should be from 1.45 to 
2.25 the metric width of the rim.  So a 406-40 tire should be put on a 
rim at least 18mm width and no more than 27mm wide.

Since manufacturers have an interest in keeping bike's light and zippy 
they tend to spec rims more narrow than that guideline.  When suggesting 
tire choices to customers I'll fudge the range a bit, working from 1.5 
to 2.5 since the math is easier to do on the spot, but I'll warn 
customers about the blowout danger on tires at the high end of that 
range, though.

If the metric width of one's rim isn't marked, one can get a decent 
estimate by averaging the measurements of the inside width, between the 
hooks, and the outside width, between the sidewalls, then round toward 
the safe side.

As a Schwalbe dealer, I'll observe that they don't make a 20x1.5 
Marathon Plus, only a 1.35 (35mm) and a 1.75 (47mm).  A 47mm tire (the 
only one that a wide #7 Schwalbe tube will fit) should ideally, by 
Sutherland's reckoning, be on a rim of at least 21mm width.

Paul,
I'd like to see what you did for "shoe pockets".  (And perhaps others 
would too.)

I've given up on jamming my 6E width feet into SPD compatible shoes.

I never even tried to get my 4E feet into them, I use "Power Grips" on big old MTB pedals.
