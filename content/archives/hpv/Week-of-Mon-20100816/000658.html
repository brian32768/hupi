<PRE>Hi,&#160; 
Ive had three front tire blowouts with my loracer, two were with 451 IRC tires, and the third was with a bmx microknobby 451 on the loracer.&#160; I stayed up on two of them, and went down on the third because I couldnt get my feet down fast enough.&#160; I braked super hard on both ends of the bike and was able to get my feet down quickly. The bmx microknobby is about the only 451 that has significant tread on it and its about a half inch wider than the irc s one and one eighth tires.&#160; It was on one of the irc s that I fell.&#160; I now run an IRC on that bike, but was able to find a thornproof tube in that size that has served me very well.&#160; I believe that the bmx microknobby, is not capable of running seriously high pressures, such as a bit over a hundred, it was just after I hit a serious bump, very serious, that the tire blew off the rim. The inflation was at 105, so if anyone tries one of those tires, hopefully run it at 90 and dont hit bumps.&#160; I actually
 reused that tire after the blow off, but at 90 psi on a lightly loaded lwb, no problems at all with that combination. YMMV
