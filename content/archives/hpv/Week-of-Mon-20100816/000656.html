</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think I am coming around to this opinion as well.&#160; Falling with 
</I>&gt;<i> front blowouts on a low recumbent will happen for the average rider, no matter 
</I>&gt;<i> what the tire or wheels (unless the number is 3...).&#160; (on an upright I 
</I>&gt;<i> might have kept my balance while stopping due the greater moment of inertia, 
</I>&gt;<i> but a fall would have caused more serious injury).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So how to protect oneself from this type of fall while still riding 2 
</I>&gt;<i> wheels?&#160; My fall was on a straight-away, mixed use bike trail (Burke Gilman 
</I>&gt;<i> north) with no near traffic.&#160; I was going about 19 mph. After the blowout I 
</I>&gt;<i> went down flat on the right very rapidly.&#160; I kept my seat and did not contact 
</I>&gt;<i> the road other than with my elbow and wrist (above seat steering Challenge 
</I>&gt;<i> Hurricane).&#160; On my taller Infinity LWB I would have fallen out of my seat 
</I>&gt;<i> and injured my hip.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So:&#160; how to protect my arms from abrasion?&#160; I am thinking that John Tetz's 
</I>&gt;<i> Zotefoam concepts would help.&#160; Perhaps bands from the front fairing to the 
</I>&gt;<i> tail box would work.

</I>JW Stephens says he hasn't had trouble on his P-38 and I also have had no 
trouble with punctures on my P-38 based modified F-40. The ability of us to 
maintain control during front flats lies in this mid height, more upright 
style of recumbent. Both the low racer and the high racer do not allow one to 
easily drop both feet to the ground in such a situation with head high and 
the ability to sit forward decoupling balance of the body from the bumpy 
movements of the frame. Clipping in to the pedals can make even this recumbent a 
handful in such a situation with its quick steering.

 I don't use clips except for racing. Most of my falls have occurred in 
those conditions The fairing I ride with everywhere helps stabilize the bikes 
steering and though I cannot recall a full blowout on the front in the twenty 
years I have been riding this bike, I have withstood quite a few front 
punctures without falling. It is because I modified the F-40 fairing to be open 
at the bottom and developed my shoe pockets to keep my feet in contact with 
the pedals that I even considered riding it all the way across the U.S. ten 
years ago.
