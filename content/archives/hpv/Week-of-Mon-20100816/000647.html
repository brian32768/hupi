</I>Yesterday I had a blowout on the front tire of my Challenge recumbent. 
Suddenly I felt like I was trying to balance on a pile of shucked 
oysters, all slippery and slidey.  Down I went and off went some skin 
from my elbow.

</I>which I've mounted Schwalbe Marathon plus 1.5 tires with big Schwalbe 
inner tubes (I hate flats).  It has occurred to me that big fat tires on
 small diameter wheels would make it harder to control in case of a 
blowout, especially on the front wheel.  My thought is that the 
proportion of the effective radius that collapses in a blowout is bigger
 with fat tires and small wheels, and the rim would have a greater 
tendency to slide off the big pile of deflated rubber.  Have others had 
that experience?  Would I have had a better chance of control with 
skinny tires?

I tink that's a problem with fat tires in general, not related to small wheels. The extra carcass width gives you that much more sideways slop, which inhibits steering and balance. A skinny tire, even when deflated, would only slide sideways a bit before regaining some traction. 

A front blowout is tough to control in the best of circumstances. On a lowracer I think you'd have to have superhuman reflexes to keep from hitting the pavement.
