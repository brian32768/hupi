&gt;<i> I tink that's a problem with fat tires in general, not related to small wheels. The extra carcass width gives you that much more sideways slop, which inhibits steering and balance. A skinny tire, even when deflated, would only slide sideways a bit before regaining some traction.

</I>I have had two instances of fairly rapid front tire deflation.

On a SWB RANS Rocket with a 44-406 Avocet Fasgrip Freestyle tire on the 
stock Alex rims, a tube tore at the valve, and after swerving a couple 
of times I went down.

On a LWB RANS Tailwind I had a large puncture on a 44-406 Tioga Comp 
Pool on a Sun Rhyno-Lite rim, and other than the bike feeling hard to 
pedal, it handled quite normally.

So the bike configuration and weight distribution can make quite a 
difference.
