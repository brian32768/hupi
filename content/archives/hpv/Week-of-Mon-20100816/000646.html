<PRE>Yesterday I had a blowout on the front tire of my Challenge recumbent. Suddenly I felt like I was trying to balance on a pile of shucked oysters, all slippery and slidey.  Down I went and off went some skin from my elbow.  
 
My bike has 20 in (406) wheels to which I've mounted Schwalbe Marathon plus 1.5 tires with big Schwalbe inner tubes (I hate flats).  It has occurred to me that big fat tires on small diameter wheels would make it harder to control in case of a blowout, especially on the front wheel.  My thought is that the proportion of the effective radius that collapses in a blowout is bigger with fat tires and small wheels, and the rim would have a greater tendency to slide off the big pile of deflated rubber.  Have others had that experience?  Would I have had a better chance of control with skinny tires?
