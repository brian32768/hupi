<PRE>&gt;<i> I am thinking that John Tetz's Zotefoam concepts would help. 
</I>.....I have had a few crashes and the foam does a fine job of protecting me. 

Years ago I had a Lightning F-40. It was fast and a very practical bike. I raced it and used it for shopping and running errands pus several long distance self supported tours. 

But once I went down when the front tire blew I lost a lot of skin on my right arm. The Spandex provided lots of speed but zero crash protection. 

That's when I started looking for better shell materials and eventually discovered Zote foam. I am hoping even better foams will be developed 

A few years ago I ran into a young boy when he ran directly in front of me. I was doing 15 mph in my white streamliner. We hit hard and both of us went down. He was not hurt nor I. The nose of the foam had collapsed in acting like a crush zone. I popped out the nose and rode off.  

The other thing about foam is the vehicle stops sliding quite quickly where as a hardshell streamliner slides and slides until it hits something.
