<PRE>The offsetting factor is that fat tires are less prone to blowouts.
Even if they get injured, with more volume it takes more time to
deflate. This has been my experience. I never really had problems
controlling my P-38 with 406 front wheel when I flatted.

</I>&gt;<i> I tink that's a problem with fat tires in general, not related to small wheels. The extra carcass width gives you that much more sideways slop, which inhibits steering and balance. A skinny tire, even when deflated, would only slide sideways a bit before regaining some traction.

</I>&gt;<i> A front blowout is tough to control in the best of circumstances. On a lowracer I think you'd have to have superhuman reflexes to keep from hitting the pavement.
