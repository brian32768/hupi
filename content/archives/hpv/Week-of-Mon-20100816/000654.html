<PRE>Yes, I think I am coming around to this opinion as well.  Falling with front blowouts on a low recumbent will happen for the average rider, no matter what the tire or wheels (unless the number is 3...).  (on an upright I might have kept my balance while stopping due the greater moment of inertia, but a fall would have caused more serious injury).

So how to protect oneself from this type of fall while still riding 2 wheels?  My fall was on a straight-away, mixed use bike trail (Burke Gilman north) with no near traffic.  I was going about 19 mph. After the blowout I went down flat on the right very rapidly.  I kept my seat and did not contact the road other than with my elbow and wrist (above seat steering Challenge Hurricane).  On my taller Infinity LWB I would have fallen out of my seat and injured my hip.  

So:  how to protect my arms from abrasion?  I am thinking that John Tetz's Zotefoam concepts would help.  Perhaps bands from the front fairing to the tail box would work.

Rim width shouldn't matter on a 1.5&quot; ... that's not very wide.
 
Front flats are where you want full stop asap regardless of bike, tire or whatever, once the tire is flat life is a crap shoot on whether you go down or not, pave or dirt, macadam or track wood unless you're on sew-ups, a fine advantage in that way over clinchers but even they have limits.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Isn't rim width going to enter into this? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm... a fat tire on a narrow rim might be more likely to blow out, but whether it makes a difference once tire is flat... I dunno. I don't think it'll make that much difference, though.
