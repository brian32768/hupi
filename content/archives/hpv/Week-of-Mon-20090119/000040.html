Grab Graham Watson ... supply him with endless rolls of film and the motorbike ... get a lasting vision, the race is over pretty quick.
 
When a pro like him is chasing things going 50-mph/80-kph on the flats instead of 30-mph/50-kph they can get talking amongst the pro's who I'm sure wouldn't mind upping the speed records if they get interested.
 
And then there's Lance ... he's not getting paid to race so why not try to wrangle him into a streamliner for a &quot;test&quot; ride??tom mallard    .net web applications       consumer product design&gt; From: <A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv">jeff at outyourbackdoor.com</A>&gt; Date: Wed, 21 Jan 2009 15:39:44 -0500&gt; To: <A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv">hpv at bikelist.org</A>&gt; Subject: Re: [hpv] 75 years of UCI ban&gt; &gt; If anyone wanted to make a true PR impact with recumbents during the &gt; Tour it would have to be well-organized.&gt; &gt; Do other bike interest groups ever use the Tour to get coverage for &gt; their special interest? Or at least attention? If so, then HPVs &gt; should do what they do.&gt; &gt; To have real impact, again, one would truly get a lot of bents---of &gt; the best, fastest, coolest-looking, most reliable, easiest-to-use, &gt; safest, best to mix in with uprights (perhaps) kinds---onto the roads &gt; nearest the most journalists and the HPV event organizer would surely &gt; hold as many press conferences as possible. They'd also host an open &gt; (free) bar.&gt; &gt; You wouldn't want duffers toodling around on gimcrack rigs that &gt; they're constantly stopping to tape or wire together.&gt; &gt; You want speed, style, simplicity...the works....on display.&gt; &gt; Perhaps a city-circuit criterium in a neighborhood of Paris with both &gt; uprights and a variety of 'bents in the race would be of interest. &gt; This event should pass by the front of the bar where the free drinks &gt; and press conference will be held.&gt; &gt; Someone should ride a replica Mochet --- it's still a great design, &gt; I'd think --- its rider did 27 miles in the Hour --- a fine pace! &gt; Make one in ti or carbon.&gt; &gt; It has to be official, pro and according to protocol.&gt; &gt; Lots of sweet bikes, a sweet event, a pro media kit, Q&amp;A, and free &gt; drinks.&gt; &gt; Oh, and there needs to be a simple point to the event. Is there a &gt; demand? UCI ban on WHAT. What rule to overturn. And be replaced by &gt; what. Should fairings be legal in the TdF? Rear fairings?&gt; &gt; Another event could be organized on one of the steepest Alps climbs &gt; to show how viable 'bents are in all-round racing.&gt; &gt; Have a fleet of 'benters ride one of the more diverse stages after/ &gt; before the racers. Then meet the media after with a report on their &gt; elapsed time as compared to the pro's. Ideally, include a stage with &gt; climbs, wind, rain and cobbles.&gt; &gt; --JP&gt; --&gt; This message comes to you via the <A HREF="http://bikelist.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv">hpv at bikelist.org</A> mailing list, sponsored by <A HREF="http://ihpva.org/">http://ihpva.org/</A>&gt; Visit <A HREF="http://bikelist.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv">http://bikelist.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv</A> to manage your subscription.
