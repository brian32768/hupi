<PRE>And what I wanted was public viewing to influence the bikes of the future!  
 
And what of the freedom of racers to select as their machines for time trials 
and non mass start events which are the best machines for the job.  If it was 
only finding the best athlete that is done in the lab.  The best racer is not 
the best athlete but the one who is good and can rally a team, make 
alliances, make racers behave in a way that permits him to stay in his optimal range or 
never let others reveal theirs.
 
Only the time trial is not so influenced, though team memembers may be told 
to stay within certain perameters to preseve a performance for later in an 
event.  Rules just narrow the range of experimentation.
 
Did the person who suggested  events to celebrate the uci ban want to remerge 
with the uci or just celebrate an option recumbents afford?
 
We are all hpvers, no matter where your seat lies in relation to your axles 
and cranks. Just don't put your head in a uci approved helmet or a fairing 
without a visor or a view screen.  You might miss the next turn or progress.
