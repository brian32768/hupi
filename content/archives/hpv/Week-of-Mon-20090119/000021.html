<PRE>John,

Are you bating me John?  This is non sequitor, or stating, as a conclusion, something that does not strictly follow from the premise.  It does not follow that because drafting is allowed, the UCI is seemingly not dedicated to measuring rider performance.  It's a given that it is far easier to regulate the hardware aspects of the sport than the race itself.  It is impractical to outlaw drafting in the peloton.  If drafting in all instances were not permitted, there would be no peloton.  Since all participating riders are permitted to draft, drafting is not a &quot;variable&quot; that undermines measurement of athletic performance.  All riders are abiding by the same set of rules and consequently there is a level playing field.  An example of when drafting is not allowed, however, is during the individual time trial ... the race of truth ... the race against the clock.  If a rider catches his leadout man, he is not permitted to draft so that measurement of rider
 performance is ensured.  We have gone off on a tangent here, straying from the original contention that UCI has specific reasons for its regulations ... regulations that will likely forever exclude participation of recumbents from UCI sanctioned events such as the Tour de France.
