Thank you for asking. The short answer is 'B'. The longer answer is below:

The celebration is for Mochet and recumbents, not UCI.

I spoke to P&#230;r, who originally sparked the idea, today. He will be going to
Paris during the last week (or so) of the Tour de France 2009, and would
like to meet with other recumbent riders there, as many as possible, and
preferably on as many different recumbents as possible.

The idea is to leverage the amount of cycling-journalists and increased
interest in cycling (sports) during Tour de France to raise awareness of
recumbents as an alternative to the UCI-sanctioned roadracers. He also
wants to honour the gentlemen Mochet, in their home land, for their efforts
in the 1930s to develop their recumbent bikes and to actually improve them
to the point where a &quot;good&quot; rider could beat &quot;great&quot; riders on traditional
bikes. This of course led to the UCI defining bicycles in a more strict
manner, thus excluding recumbents from (UCI) racing.

But that doesn't mean that recumbents aren't great and worthy bikes, and
that's why P&#230;r wants to make a &quot;get-together&quot; in Paris this summer, to show
the public what bikes can *also* look like. If anyone wants to join him, or
help him, or contact him for any other reason :-) here's how:
