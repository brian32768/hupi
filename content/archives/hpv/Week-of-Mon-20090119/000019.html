<PRE>Bicycle racing does have this ambiguity to it, since in one way it is 
about the athlete, but on the other hand the athlete must use someone 
else's equipment to travel in a superhuman manner.  With the tight 
limitation on bike design in place we can maintain a belief that the 
competition is still based on athletic prowess and all the moral things 
we like to associate with it, such as dedication and a willingness to 
overcome pain, etc.  Thus the big flap about who has the better drugs, 
which takes away that moral aspect that makes the riders all the more 
interesting.  By leveling the playing field we can root for a &quot;good guy&quot; 
or a &quot;rebel&quot; or whatever, figuring that who they are has some effect on 
their performance.

While slight variations in bikes' designs let the sponsors fuss about 
their new superbikes, we have seen what full-out design freedom turns 
the event into from our own HPV races.  With fully-faired HPVs being the 
fastest, at least under time trial circumstances, the athletes 
themselves vanish entirely under the skin of the vehicle and the fluid 
engineering takes control.  Not only is it all that is visible, but 
there is the sense that the better designed HPV will win no matter who 
is riding it (as was the case with Faure way back when).  Bike racing 
is, to some degree, a competition between engineers, but this fact is 
far more evident in HPV racing.

The fastest HPVs have other dissatisfying aspects for spectators and 
groupies.  Of course the UCI athletes have teams of mechanics following 
them around in a way that ordinary mortals do not, they still just climb 
on their bike and pedal it the way anyone would.  They don't need a crew 
to tape them up inside the vehicle.

In some ways we might be better off looking at automobile racing as a 
paradigm.  The public seems capable of venerating NASCAR drivers though 
they do little more than concentrate and hold a steering wheel, while it 
is obvious that the driver would be nothing without the engineers and 
mechanics that build the car and keep it going.  HPV racers still deal 
with the suffering the way that auto racers do not.
