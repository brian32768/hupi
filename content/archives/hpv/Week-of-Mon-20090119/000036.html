Well, a bit maybe! I do try to draft behind younger riders at times when 
commuting and certainly do so in group touring which would be too fast for me 
otherwise. I also get a almost totally free ride occasionally when I can &quot;catch&quot; 
a bus.


 &gt; Let's not argue whether the recumbent rider
 &gt; could be a member of the peloton society.

Let's! High recumbents are not much different from low uprights. But recumbents 
seem to get more benefit from uprights than vice versa.

Quite. But we have a long way to go. I only had one ride in a fully faired trike 
in rolling countryside on fast roads in strong winds. It was fast and 
exhilarating! But the same vehicle was next to useless where I live in suburbia: 
too slow and sweaty uphill and too fast downhill. Even tests with assisted 
vehicles were too sweaty for me. But I think this could be solved with active 
ventilation. See for example <A HREF="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0002/0002.htm">http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0002/0002.htm</A>
