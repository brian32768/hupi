<PRE>If anyone wanted to make a true PR impact with recumbents during the  
Tour it would have to be well-organized.

Do other bike interest groups ever use the Tour to get coverage for  
their special interest? Or at least attention? If so, then HPVs  
should do what they do.

To have real impact, again, one would truly get a lot of bents---of  
the best, fastest, coolest-looking, most reliable, easiest-to-use,  
safest, best to mix in with uprights (perhaps) kinds---onto the roads  
nearest the most journalists and the HPV event organizer would surely  
hold as many press conferences as possible. They'd also host an open  
(free) bar.

You wouldn't want duffers toodling around on gimcrack rigs that  
they're constantly stopping to tape or wire together.

You want speed, style, simplicity...the works....on display.

Perhaps a city-circuit criterium in a neighborhood of Paris with both  
uprights and a variety of 'bents in the race would be of interest.  
This event should pass by the front of the bar where the free drinks  
and press conference will be held.

Someone should ride a replica Mochet --- it's still a great design,  
I'd think --- its rider did 27 miles in the Hour --- a fine pace!  
Make one in ti or carbon.

It has to be official, pro and according to protocol.

Lots of sweet bikes, a sweet event, a pro media kit, Q&amp;A, and free  
drinks.

Oh, and there needs to be a simple point to the event. Is there a  
demand? UCI ban on WHAT. What rule to overturn. And be replaced by  
what. Should fairings be legal in the TdF? Rear fairings?

Another event could be organized on one of the steepest Alps climbs  
to show how viable 'bents are in all-round racing.

Have a fleet of 'benters ride one of the more diverse stages after/ 
before the racers. Then meet the media after with a report on their  
elapsed time as compared to the pro's. Ideally, include a stage with  
climbs, wind, rain and cobbles.
