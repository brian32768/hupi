<PRE>Jim,
I'm platform-independent too.  In fact since I live in a small town I put my 
bikes away completely in the winter and walk/run everywhere - otherwise I'd 
be spending all my time cleaning the bikes (and they'd still dissolve from 
salt every few years).  I agree that UCI has good intentions of making 
cycling a pure sport, and that uniformity of design serves that limited 
purpose.  In most other racing sports there is an unlimited class so that 
arbitrary limits don't stifle design variety.  I guess you could think of 
this as cyclo-diversity.  The current situation I see is that the 
&quot;professional&quot; sanctioning organization won't initiate an unlimited class 
and the &quot;hobbyist&quot; organization doesn't have the revenue to publicize it's 
cyclo-diverse events.

It would make sense to me that the UCI should embrace an unlimited class, 
which only imposes limits for the safety of participants and spectators. 
There may be other options that make as much sense, but I haven't seen one 
yet.  However, UCI dogma is still in the captain's seat (and there is no 
stoker seat on this bike).

Come to think of it, is there even a category for tandem racing in UCI?

btw I'm designing a bike that will be more weatherproof yet light enough for 
the breathtaking WV hills.  That's not getting any financial or moral 
support at the moment either - so it's been languishing because it depends 
on my motivation and availability.  I'll put up newer pictures on my website 
this week.  I'm happy to give away the design - especially when I'm not 
making progress on it.  Oddly enough it hasn't been stolen yet.

Thanks.
Nick

&gt;<i> Allow me to preface what I have to say by stating that I ride both a 
</I>&gt;<i> recumbent and an upright, so it is reasonable to assume that I am not 
</I>&gt;<i> afflicted with platform prejudice.  Many competitive events have 
</I>&gt;<i> regulations and established participation categories.  Drag racing comes 
</I>&gt;<i> to mind.  Why some recumbent enthusiasts bemoan the fact that they are 
</I>&gt;<i> unwelcome at UCI events I find puzzling.  Shelving the rabid recumbent 
</I>&gt;<i> evangelism for a moment, the unbiased, astute recumbent enthusiast should 
</I>&gt;<i> realize why stringent,restrictive UCI regulations were put in place.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> is not a matter of unyielding prejudicial myopia or inflexible opposition 
</I>&gt;<i> to technological advances in bicycle design, but rather an attempt to 
</I>&gt;<i> equitably measure athletic performance rather than measure the merits of 
</I>&gt;<i> cutting-edge innovation in bicycle design.  UCI regulation is intended to 
</I>&gt;<i> ensure controlled measurement of the biological engine.  An open field of 
</I>&gt;<i> bicycles in an unregulated
</I>&gt;<i> multiplicity of forms would serve to undermine the UCI objective.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> expect that the UCI will never to be receptive to participation of any 
</I>&gt;<i> bicycle that does not strictly conform to rigid UCI regulations.  Frankly, 
</I>&gt;<i> I wish the Tour de France organizes would invite a recumbent team with UCI 
</I>&gt;<i> blessing (temporary exemption from regulation) with the only restriction 
</I>&gt;<i> being ... no fairings.  When Team Recumbent finished dead last in the team 
</I>&gt;<i> competition and failed to win any of the individual jersey competitions, 
</I>&gt;<i> that would put an end to many a debate regarding recumbent superiority. 
</I>&gt;<i> If the sole purpose is to raise the awareness of onlookers and demonstrate 
</I>&gt;<i> that their is an alternative to the traditional upright bicycle, a group 
</I>&gt;<i> of recumbents could ride each and every Tour de France stage before the 
</I>&gt;<i> pros do their thing.  Chances are they might even receive some TV 
</I>&gt;<i> coverage. - Jim McNamara
