<PRE>The time trial bikes are already quite different from the bikes in other stages.  So why not really different?  At least in one stage.  

But, class distinctions and strict regulation and athletic performance aside, bicycle racing has always played a role in the development of the technology of bicycles.  The technology of bicycles is important we can all agree.  I think it is very important.  So I would like to see all types of bicycles tested under conditions representative of contemporary commuting conditions.  And I would like to see that competition well funded.  In the bike world as it is that means the UCI tours.

I mean, really, what would be so bad about one unlimited time trial stage?

Since the UCI's objective its to ensure fair measurement of athletic performance, it logically follows that strict regulation of what is defined as a bicycle is a necessary requirement.  Different classes of competition would only serve to segregate rather than incorporate the recumbent into that main field which is seemingly what some recumbent enthusiasts would prefer.  Regardless, I don't realistically expect the UCI to buy off on different classes.
