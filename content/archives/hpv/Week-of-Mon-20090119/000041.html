<PRE>Jeff,

A much more sensible and pragmatic approach ... more of what I would have in mind if I intended to organize such an event.  Ignore the UCI like the UCI has ignore the recumbent.  Do you own thing in your own style ... a venue that would effectively get the word out.  If that's the purpose, do what is most likely to achieve your objective ... do what is likely to work rather than what had been proven not to ... beating on the door of the UCI.

Jim McNamara

</I>&gt;<i> If so, then HPVs should do what they do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To have real impact, again, one would truly get a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> bents---of the best, fastest, coolest-looking, most
</I>&gt;<i> reliable, easiest-to-use, safest, best to mix in with
</I>&gt;<i> uprights (perhaps) kinds---onto the roads nearest the most
</I>&gt;<i> journalists and the HPV event organizer would surely hold as
</I>&gt;<i> many press conferences as possible. They'd also host an
</I>&gt;<i> open (free) bar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You wouldn't want duffers toodling around on gimcrack
</I>&gt;<i> rigs that they're constantly stopping to tape or wire
</I>&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You want speed, style, simplicity...the works....on
</I>&gt;<i> display.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps a city-circuit criterium in a neighborhood of Paris
</I>&gt;<i> with both uprights and a variety of 'bents in the race
</I>&gt;<i> would be of interest. This event should pass by the front of
</I>&gt;<i> the bar where the free drinks and press conference will be
</I>&gt;<i> held.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Someone should ride a replica Mochet --- it's still a
</I>&gt;<i> great design, I'd think --- its rider did 27 miles in
</I>&gt;<i> the Hour --- a fine pace! Make one in ti or carbon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It has to be official, pro and according to protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of sweet bikes, a sweet event, a pro media kit,
</I>&gt;<i> Q&amp;A, and free drinks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and there needs to be a simple point to the event. Is
</I>&gt;<i> there a demand? UCI ban on WHAT. What rule to overturn. And
</I>&gt;<i> be replaced by what. Should fairings be legal in the TdF?
</I>&gt;<i> Rear fairings?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another event could be organized on one of the steepest
</I>&gt;<i> Alps climbs to show how viable 'bents are in all-round
</I>&gt;<i> racing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have a fleet of 'benters ride one of the more diverse
</I>&gt;<i> stages after/before the racers. Then meet the media after
</I>&gt;<i> with a report on their elapsed time as compared to the
</I>&gt;<i> pro's. Ideally, include a stage with climbs, wind, rain
</I>&gt;<i> and cobbles.
