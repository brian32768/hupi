<PRE>Hey, I love watching the society of the peloton in action.  The peloton is beautiful, exciting to watch, and efficient. But it does not represent any of the ways that we commute today. Let's not argue whether the recumbent rider could be a member of the peloton society.  

That is why the proposal is restricted to a time trial per tour representative of a commute route in a great city.  

I believe that our recumbent technology with streamlining is important to the future of transportation.  It deserves a place at a big table.

Bicycle racing does have this ambiguity to it, since in one way it is 
about the athlete, but on the other hand the athlete must use someone 
else's equipment to travel in a superhuman manner.  With the tight 
limitation on bike design in place we can maintain a belief that the 
competition is still based on athletic prowess and all the moral things 
we like to associate with it, such as dedication and a willingness to 
overcome pain, etc.  Thus the big flap about who has the better drugs, 
which takes away that moral aspect that makes the riders all the more 
interesting.  By leveling the playing field we can root for a &quot;good guy&quot; 
or a &quot;rebel&quot; or whatever, figuring that who they are has some effect on 
their performance.

While slight variations in bikes' designs let the sponsors fuss about 
their new superbikes, we have seen what full-out design freedom turns 
the event into from our own HPV races.  With fully-faired HPVs being the 
fastest, at least under time trial circumstances, the athletes 
themselves vanish entirely under the skin of the vehicle and the fluid 
engineering takes control.  Not only is it all that is visible, but 
there is the sense that the better designed HPV will win no matter who 
is riding it (as was the case with Faure way back when).  Bike racing 
is, to some degree, a competition between engineers, but this fact is 
far more evident in HPV racing.
