<PRE>Well, I didn't think changing the UCI would be a roll over as some seem to imply!  But all changes have to start sometime. BTW, since UCI lost direct control of the TdF last year (do I have that right?), I see that Amaury Sport Organization is identified as the TdF organizer

 (<A HREF="http://www.multichannel.com/article/133570-Versus_Rides_To_New_Tour_De_France_Deal.php">http://www.multichannel.com/article/133570-Versus_Rides_To_New_Tour_De_France_Deal.php</A>).

Can someone comment on the current relationships between TdF, Amaury and UCI?

I will continue to follow the speed record heroes, Whittingham and Georgiev and Zabovnik and all the others, on the web with an occasional brief mention in the conventional media; and I will watch the tours for hours on Versus cable TV channel here in the States, and I will repair and ride my old faired Infinity.  If I lived in Europe I would love to help Torben and P&#230;r with their project in person.  Can anything be done in virtuality?

Thank you for asking. The short answer is 'B'. The longer answer is below:

The celebration is for Mochet and recumbents, not UCI.

I spoke to P&#230;r, who originally sparked the idea, today. He will be going to
Paris during the last week (or so) of the Tour de France 2009, and would
like to meet with other recumbent riders there, as many as possible, and
preferably on as many different recumbents as possible.

The idea is to leverage the amount of cycling-journalists and increased
interest in cycling (sports) during Tour de France to raise awareness of
recumbents as an alternative to the UCI-sanctioned roadracers. He also
wants to honour the gentlemen Mochet, in their home land, for their efforts
in the 1930s to develop their recumbent bikes and to actually improve them
to the point where a &quot;good&quot; rider could beat &quot;great&quot; riders on traditional
bikes. This of course led to the UCI defining bicycles in a more strict
manner, thus excluding recumbents from (UCI) racing.

But that doesn't mean that recumbents aren't great and worthy bikes, and
that's why P&#230;r wants to make a &quot;get-together&quot; in Paris this summer, to show
the public what bikes can *also* look like. If anyone wants to join him, or
help him, or contact him for any other reason :-) here's how:
