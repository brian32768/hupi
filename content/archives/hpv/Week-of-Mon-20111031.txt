Subject: [hpv] Pedicabs and politics
Message-ID: <4EB1FAFC.9050200@easystreetrecumbents.com>

I could use some input.  This is a bit offbeat, but probably interesting 
to lovers of workbikes.

Being a tourist town, Austin has a lot of pedicabs in it.  I like 
pedicabs, as I like it when people use bikes for practical purposes, and 
I like big workbikes/trikes in general.  Like many, I'm leery of 
"pedicabs" which are large trailers (always without their own brakes) 
whose gross, loaded weight far exceeds that of the mountain bike and 
rider towing it by the seatpost.  Known trailer crashes include 
jackknifing when the bike brakes during a turn, seatpost failure, or 
falls when the rider is unable to climb with the load.  A trailer costs 
about 1/10 of what a new, purpose-built trike does but it can be leased 
out at the same rate as a trike pedicab, so they are flooding the local 
market, hurting operators (not so much owners/lessors).

Most cities with pedicabs don't allow trailer pedicabs, but Austin 
hasn't set such rules yet.  The city is in the process of revising all 
its pedicab laws in response to the explosion of cabs downtown and 
around the University of Texas football games.  This has set off a lot 
of internal politics in the industry as the tricycle-pedicab companies 
(mostly small independents, a few medium sized operations and one big 
company) are trying to get the city to restrict the use, or at least 
growth, of trailer-pedicabs.

The most compelling argument for the public is safety.  The problem 
making this argument is that since so few cities allow trailer pedicabs, 
there is very little data.  Pedicabbies working on the streets see 
trailer crashes, but the drunken chuckleheads dumped on the street 
aren't much interested on police or ambulances.  I heard a report of a 
passenger's broken arm (trailer jackknifed stopping for a surprise 
pedestrian in a fast right turn), but even such reported crashes, with 
injuries, get filed by the police with other "bike crashes."  It is hard 
to point to statistics.  I might intuitively consider it dangerous, but 
convincing the city against resistance from trailer companies requires 
better proof.  Documented crashes nationwide are inevitably on 
tricycle-pedicabs since they are 99% of what operates.

Some independent tricycle operators know me since I work on their rigs.  
They asked if I could render an expert opinion on the unfitness of an 
ordinary bike towing a trailer thrice its weight.  While I consider such 
a contraption dubious in the extreme, I can't claim expertise just being 
a bike dealer.  I'm not an engineer, or a builder.  I don't even sell 
upright bikes. They might ask other shops, but I suspect a LBS would be 
unwilling to stick their necks out.  Wanting to help in the cause of 
good-equipment over cheap-equipment, I offered instead to find others in 
the industry who would know more about the hazards of putting a bicycle 
to this kind of use.

Any suggestions?  I've got a few ideas, but no solid leads.  Calling 
around on the phone isn't my specialty, but I'll do it.  Trailer makers 
probably have studied it.  Makers of seatposts probably have some number 
related to forces on their parts.  Bike makers might be able to state 
their concerns about the safety of their bikes put to this purpose, but 
probably don't do actual tests of their bike's unfitness for wacky jobs 
like that.  And then who might be willing to stick their necks out?

Does anyone here know of scientific studies covering the dynamics of 
oversized trailers' effects on bicycles?  Or know of someone in the bike 
industry or bike science that might?.  Any documentation needs to get to 
the city by the Nov. 16th.

There was at one time a flourishing pedicab industry in Las Vegas, but it was virtually shut down seven years ago when they were prohibited from operating on or near the Strip, largely at the behest of the taxicab industry. I saw a lot of pedicabs when I moved here in 1999, but I don't recall seeing any trailers on the Strip. 
 
Because of the paucity of bicycling data in general, I doubt you'll have much success finding information about trailer safety. I can only recommend you ask on the Pedicab Forum (pedicabforum.com) and hope for a response. As an alternative, you may find useful data regarding trailer weight versus tow-vehicle weight ("towing capacity") at your state Department of Motor Vehicles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (nhtsa.gov), or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (iihs.org). Good luck.

I still think the ideas is neat. Could work for many other applications.
Helpful for handicapped etc. and not just for bicycles.
Of course in general this is not useful for bicycles. Even tho the bicycle
is a simple machine we all know the human motor is very complex and finicky
haha
The bicycle makes a perfect platform to use for experimentation as it is
cheap and simple.

I can't help but wonder what kind of "thinking" is necessary to change 
gears.  If I start think about heavy metal music as I'm climbing, will 
my bicycle shift into high gear and bring me to a stop?

I'll grant that I can see the usefulness when the Veterans 
Administration sends these half-blown-up soldiers up from the medical 
center in San Antonio to buy trikes from me.  Often there is enough left 
on them to steer, but manipulating controls can be difficult with all 
your fingers left overseas.

I think it is obvious that a heavy trailer cannot be ridden the same way 
as a light one. It boils down to speed, gradient, common sense and 
experience. My heaviest usual load is about 60 kg apples nicely balanced 
on a traditional trailer attached to the seat post. The trailer weighs 
20 kg, I weigh 80 kg and my electric bike weighs 35 kg. I can safely 
ride 30 km/h if it is flat and straight and no sudden stops likely. I 
can ride down a steep (about 1:5) hill and around sharp bends, but then 
slow down to 10 km/h. I have at times carried people in the trailer, and 
this is perfectly safe in good conditions, but I would obviouisly avoid 
steep gradients and high speeds.

Heavy farm trailers attached by a ball-and-socket to the seat post are 
traditional in Switzerland. I don't think there is much regulation 
except the width which mustn't exceed 1 m, and possibly a weight limit 
of 80 or 100 kg. Passenger-carrying is not allowed (except children), 
but as soon as the passengers can pedal themselves, I guess the trailers 
are considered part of the vehicle and tolerated.

In Thun we have a tourist amenity called the Thuner Trampelwurm. See 
http://www.trampelwurm.ch. There is also an article in an old "Human 
Power". It is a trike with *ten* trailers! I ride this occasionally. 
With ten people we limit the speed to 10 km/h, 15 is just possible 
before the trailers start to jackknife. With just two or four trailers, 
there is no problem going at 20 km/h. The slightest gradients are a big 
problem (when empty), as the complete vehicle weighs over 500 kg. There 
are automatic brakes on all trailers, but they don't really seem to 
work, so we have hydraulic brakes on the trike and first two trailers. 
This is adequate in dry conditions. In wet conditions the drivers have 
to be super-careful and go really slowly if there is any chance of 
having to brake.

Our "Centipedal" has been going for 15 years. There are 4 of the 
vehicles and thousands of trips have been done. There are plenty of 
minor "accidents", mainly catching "street furniture" with one of the 
last trailers, as a 90 degree turn lets the last trailer trail inside by 
25 cm, and the drivers sometimes forget this. Sometimes the wheels fold, 
as they are really inadequate for going around corners with heavy 
people. There is no problem in heavy traffic and amoungst pedestrians. 
When the drivers go too fast or the passengers pedal too hard, the rear 
trailers sway and jackknife. Annoying, but there have never been any 
serious injuries and only very few minor ones. The 15 m long, 1 m wide 
vehicles are officially accepted and insurable as "bicycles" by the 
local police and indeed most places in Switzerland, but this is mainly 
because there are no specific laws prohibiting them and the vehicles 
were run for some years by the city of Thun itself. However the city of 
Winterthur banned them once and was reprimanded by the police dept. of 
Thun on Swiss TV! If there are ever serious accidents or the 
"Health&Safety" attitudes get more extreme, I expect that they will no 
longer be able to use the roads. So we do our best to train the drivers 
to drive sensibly.

Exactly. But when carrying passengers for hire I'd expect a little
more than "the rider has to pay attention". My limited experience
with seatpost hitch trailers has been somewhat scary. With any real
load they start to take control of the bike. For this reason I have
never built such a trailer nor would I use one if there was an
alternative.

I have enough trouble towing 100kg in a two wheel trailer attached
to the rear axle of the bike. It's very easy for the trailer to lift
the rear wheel off the ground on bumps unless the bike has heavy
panniers as well. And stopping requires considerable caution.

The trike pedicabs are much more stable and easy to handle. Even in
the hands of idiots (it gets boring, so we play games like "do figure
8's on two wheels with another rider in the passenger seat"). The
main problem we have is riders forgetting just how wide the trikes
are (they seat two passengers side by side). They go through narrow
gaps and crunch up the trikes. But yes, good brakes and sensible
design makes the three wheelers great. They're ~$AUS4000 from memory.
I can't imagine building a trailer would be much easier, you would
probably save $1000 by not having gears or brakes, but the rest of
it would be the same. I hope...

I have a four wheel trailer with inertia brakes on the front wheels
that is 1m wide by 2.4m long and has carried ~500kg. I tow it behind
my four wheel loadbike. Between the disk brakes on all four wheels
of the quad and the V brakes on the trailer it stops pretty well.
The four wheelers makes all the difference to safety. It's hard to
tip the quad over, and the inertia brakes do most of the stopping
with lightweight loads. 500kg is very hard to pull, but I found it
quite controllable (I also had ~120kg on the quad plus my 80kg.
And I have experience driving large trucks... it handles like a
truck in that situation. An old, underpowered truck :).

That trailer is not legal for carrying people in Australia (it's
a flatbed anyway), and is possibly not a legal bike trailer at all
(the law doesn't mention this design, only the permitted axle
overhangs, but always uses the singular form of "axle" where
that trailer has four axles - one per wheel, just like many two
wheel trailers). I have never been hassled by the Police, but
they have waved at me as I go past.

This sounds completely unlike the stereotype of the Swiss. "there is no
law prohibiting it" is the sort of reason I'd expect in New Zealand,
not in Switzerland. Surely you're more organised than that :)

A new study at at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) shows that if people in the upper Midwest chose to take half of their car trips by bicycle, health care costs would drop by $7 billion, and the improved air quality would result in 1100 fewer deaths each year.

Cornel;

Thanks for that article. It's the kind of thing I need to convince my town officials the need for a biking infrastructure. 

I particularly liked how they pointed out that short runs of less than 5 miles has a large benefit for both the individual biker and the environment. Its one of my mantras.
