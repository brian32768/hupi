Good evening,
An industrial designer who puts out a bike design blog just asked me why the IHPSC hasn't been held in a while.  I told him it was because the volunteers who had been putting it on ran out of steam.  At least that's the way I understood it.  Has anyone considered building up steam to do it again?

Sure thing Nick,
We have been working up to bringing back that great big 
interdisciplinary human powered gathering many of us hold fond memories 
of, the recent reunification of the IHPVA should make it come together 
all that much sooner.
Several members of the board as well as other inspired event organizers 
are currently looking at several sites with an eye to the future.
This year the event at Ford's proving grounds in July, organized by 
IHPVA rules committee member Mike Mowett, will be bringing us all closer 
to that original IHPSC spirit.

Did you have some "steam" to give up for this happening?
I sure hope so, as an IHPSC takes the energy of many and at least a 
year's dedication to producing a world class event!
And hey, it's not like we quit racing HPVs, the WHPSC in Battle Mountain 
is in it's 10th year. www.whpsc.org

Keep an eye out for news and information at www.ihpva.org and be sure to 
check out the forum space there ( http://www.ihpva.org/forums/ ) to 
discuss IHPVA events and other related things.

Thanks for your support!

I'm afraid this is at present wishful thinking, as the premature name change of 
the HPVA has achieved the opposite of a reunification.

There are now *two* IHPVAs, which is of course a stupid situation, which is far 
from being resolved. We will have too wait for one of the IHPVAs to rename 
itself again for things to get clearer.

The series of Velomobile Design Seminars started in 1993 in Copenhagen. 
Through 15 years the seminars have been an important inspiration to the 
development of velomobiles for practical transport and sport.

The perspectives for velomobiles as an alternative, environmental 
friendly means of transportation are today more obvious than ever. In 
many situations a velomobile can replace a car, offering cargo space, 
weather protection, better aerodynamics and higher speed than an 
ordinary bicycle.
People need more physical exercise for health care reasons, to stay or 
to become fit, to improve quality of life. A velomobile is a comfortable 
and secure means to get training.

The velomobile doesn?t increase greenhouse-gas emissions, an issue, 
which has gained increasing attention in the last 5 years. The United 
Nations (Conference of Parties under UNFCCC) has called for the next 
Climate Conference in the first week of December 2009. It will take 
place in the Bella Center in Copenhagen. On this occasion, let us 
demonstrate the potential of velomobiles for an environmental friendly 
lifestyle.

The Velomobile Design Seminars allows to discuss many subjects, such as 
social acceptance of velomobiles, solutions for the infrastructure, 
technical innovations and design and styling.

The seminar organization invites you to present your contributions to 
skills and knowledge necessary for further development of velomobiles.

Send your abstract (max 500 words) to:
designseminar at liggecykelforeningen.dk
before October 31st, 2008.

The abstracts will be reviewed by the program committee:
Dr. Andreas Fuchs (Switzerland)
M.Sc. Frederik Van De Walle (Belgium/Sweden)
Dr. Stefan Gloger (Germany)
Dr. Carl Georg Rasmussen (Denmark)
You will be informed not later than December 31st, 2008, whether your 
proposal is accepted. If your abstract is accepted you will receive 
instruction for authors.
Deadline for submission of final paper will be August 31th , 2009.
The proceedings of the 6th Velomobile Design Seminar will be published 
in digital form only.
