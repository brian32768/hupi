Hi

During last year I self-published a book about Human Powered Vehicles.  My bike building has spanned over more than 20 years and I wanted to share some of my experience of the more exotic types of bikes and HPV's with others. The result of several years of work is "An Illustrated Guide to the Cycle Zoo".

Webpage for the book is here, http://www.modularbikes.com.au/book/ , for many the quickest way to get a copy is through ebay, a worldwide search for "cycle zoo" on your local ebay site should find the listing.

Recently I have added value to the book by providing some on-line material including plans of bikes I've made. A few list members already have the book I'm sure, any comments / questions /opinions?

Best Wishes
