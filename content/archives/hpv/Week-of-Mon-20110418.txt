 From the video they seem to have added a small wheel of the same size  
rotating in the opposite direction atop each of the ground connected  
wheels to try and cancel out local gyro forces. I don't think they  
succeeded as much as they might have wished, as the rim velocity would  
be the same as a large wheel. Only the mass would be much reduced.  
They state that they used in effect a reversed caster on the front but  
they would still have perhaps enough residual gyro forces once things  
got moving to hold the line of travel within the narrow self  
correcting range of the entire system including the inertia of their  
handlebars.

On a somewhat related thought experiment I wrote to an Automotive  
writer for the LA Times after she, a very skilled high speed  
motorcyclist, had written of her inability to keep upright when she  
tried the X-prize winning X-tracer electric Cabin Motorcycle based on  
the Swiss BMW powered  Monotracer.  That machine has a recumbent  
riding position, and starts out steering like a car before retracting  
its 'landing gear' near 18mph  and suddenly behaving like a bike. A  
rather steep learning curve. . One of the engineers who did the  
electric conversion told me I might be one of the few he knew who  
might be able to just get on and ride, but I rather doubt that. In  
addition to its much greater mass than the 'crotch rockets' she was  
used to, it had an empty seat  and the mass of the motor and battery  
pack behind her to try and instantly cope with. I told her about the  
sort of balancing methods we recumbent riders use, and she thanked me  
for my input, but was not at all anxious to try it again.

  I believe this exercise in understanding two wheeled stability may  
have been in search of the self balancing algorythm we will need to  
get two wheeled vehicles to the state of 'ease of use' that the  
general public will need in the future. Such vehicles will add  
immensely to the efficiency of our road systems' carrying capacity.  
The engineer I mentioned has said that the miles per kwh of the X- 
tracer is well more than double that of the Nissan Leaf. The EPA  
computation of eMpg that is used on the window stickers for the Volt  
and the Leaf is based on calculations for four wheeled vehicles that  
most often contain just one person.  What the X-tracer needs more than  
anything else to be anything more than a rich persons plaything(It  
will cruise at top autobahn speeds with ease and air-conditioned  
comfort, but with costs commensurate) is an automated balancing system  
and an easier ingress. Fully  faired HPV's could become more common  
place with those improvements as well[mandatory HPV content].

Paul,

"The engineer I mentioned has said that the miles per kwh of the X-
tracer is well more than double that of the Nissan Leaf."

I have lusted after an Ecomobile (the predecessor of the
Monotracer/E-Tracer) for decades.  Saw one up close at the TTXGP races
at VIR last summer.  The national rep lives in Richmond.

http://www.21stcenturymotoring.com/

The one that went around the world averaged 113 Wh/mi for 18,600
miles.  That is way better than the Leaf.

http://www.zero-race.com/

I will never be able to afford an E-Tracer, but this bike is
definitely on my radar!

http://www.schultzengineering.us/

I hope to see it at the Vetter Economy Challenge in July.

Supposedly, Randy Schlitter is building an electric streamliner for
this event too.  Should be a must see event.

........I have been riding my 6 year old trike based Velomobile during the  winter on a almost daily bases and recently got back on a low front wheel drive bike when the weather got warmer. The seat is 7 inches off the ground (so is the trike seat). This 15 year old bike has been one of my favorites because of its aerodynamics but also of its quick but precise handling. It feels like its an extension of my body. 

But after riding a trike for 6 months getting back on this bike I couldn't keep a straight line - I kept wiggling. It took more than an hour before I began to get that comfortable feeling again and could hold a straight line. 
I have realized that it took energy to balance a bike but hadn't realized how much until this recent trike to bike experience.  

When I first built my trike I began to noticed how relaxing it was to run errands around town and not having to get the feet down at intersections. There was no tension when stopping or when starting at low speeds. No balance requirement. I could spend more of my efforts on sizing up the traffic situations at the intersections. 
I could also relax in mall parking lots and if a car was backing out of a parking place simply jam on the brakes.  

And during the winter there was always that fear of going down from black ice at night when on a bike/streamliner  (which happened a few times) which is gone on a trike. 

If you want to hot rod around a bike is much more fun than a trike. But for alternate transportation the trike layout shines.

And I can ride a straight line on a bike, but I pedal steer like crazy  
on a trike. ;-)   Guess it is all in what you are used to.

Yes, this is where trikes really shine.

I rarely use any of my trikes in town for a simple reason: with a bike you can 
*always* get through traffic in time, as you can (almost) always overtake 
stopped traffic on the outside, or quickly dismount and push the bike past an 
obstruction on the sidewalk. A trike has a fixed minimum width and often there 
is less space than this. Also pushing on the sidewalk is more awkward.

Therefore I can guarantee timely arrival to the minute on a bike, but for a 
trike (or bike with trailer) I must allow some extra time in case of stopped 
traffic.

Cheers, Theo Schmidt

Same with me and for the same reasons. I used to commute bike trike but now that I live in Berkeley and have to commute through heavy traffic in Berkeley and Oakland, I commute by bike. Still recumbent though, HP Velotechnik Grasshopper FX to be exact. It is great to be able to _slowly and cautiously_ thread my way through long queues of stationary vehicles not having to sit behind them breathing in fumes at exhaust pipe level.

I keep both in my stable for those reasons.  If it is raining, snowing, or icy I use the LEITRA, if the weather is going to be nice I use a two wheeler.  For those that don't live in extreme climates only a bike might work, for those of use with -20 C mornings in the winter a velo is the only way to travel.

After nearly 60 years of practise, I can hold my line very well on a bike, but during my one ride on an upright trike, I hit a parked car because I couldn't steer away from it.

Thanks to Zach, and Theo for your views on using tikes vs bikes. Good information. 

I have wondered how trikes work out in urban areas where traffic is really dense. 

In the average suburban towns in my area we have enough room for a trike. 
So I seldom ride a bike anymore. The car drivers treat my VM as a vehicle and often give me room. I can take a lane for a short while. 

I think part of this change in publics behavior comes from them seeing me running errands over the last 6 years in the VM and realizing that this is good for the  environment. They tell me that when they talk to me. 
People are slowly learning. 

I have the feeling that eventually there could be a market for VMs, not the racy looking type we have now but lighter more practical types set up for average folks.

Lray would have a good response to this, because of his trike experience in Southern California. Here in Las Vegas, I see three trike-riders regularly who seem to fare just fine, one of whom often takes a lane down a busy, shoulderless 45mph avenue I have never dared on a bike.

Lray is now in Colorado. I think the size and rarity of the trikes  
gives them a "what the heck is that?" advantage. When they are fully  
faired the effect is even greater. My modified F-40 has the same  
effect, even amongst the the thousands of regular cyclists that  
partook of Los Angeles CycLAvia two weeks ago. That was the event   
which closed off 7.5 miles( 12km) of downtown city streets on a Sunday  
so that anyone on any form of no- motorized vehicle could 'take the  
road' for five hours or so. This was the second such event here, model  
on the weekly event held in Bogota, Columbia. It is becoming popular  
and the mayor wants to do it monthly eventually. Las Vegas should  
consider it too. Happy Earth Day Everyone!

I test rode a trike at 'Bent Up in his mostly quiet N. Hollywood  
neighborhood.  I couldn't even enter the road from his back alley  
without feeling completely blind trying to see around parked cars.   I  
know any lowish recumbent is going to have this issue to some extent,  
but it just felt like much more of an issue than on my bike with maybe  
a 23" high seat.

That said, I think a trike would work on most of the loops I ride in  
San Francisco. They are mostly parks and roads with bike lanes.

Hi -

Seeking some ideas regarding getting a hold of a bike, preferably a 
recumbent for 3 weeks while I plan to be in Austria, arriving there May 2.

I was thinking it might make sense to buy something and then either sell 
it at the end of the trip or ship it back to the US, as I think renting 
might be rather pricey.

Anyway, just thought I'd throw this mail out there and see if anyone had 
any suggestions.

Wish I'd done a better job of planning - as I see what looks to be an 
interesting event happening in southern Germany next weekend. I think I 
might have arranged to try to go there first - but I got my ticket to 
Vienna before I was even aware of it.  (http://www.spezialradmesse.de/)

Thanks.
