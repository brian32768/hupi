Well, I'm not sure it fits with the UCI's stated/claimed objective,
but it certainly *could* be done without making a mess of the rest of
the race or interfering with said objective - and certainly I at least
would be very interested to see the results! Would be great to see
:-).

M5's website has a few news items along these lines - "Greg Gross
participates in the Texas Time Trials: M5 Titanium Carbon Low Racer
beats records", "Mission accomplished - 50,392 km in one hour! October
24 2008: Gert Jan Wijers rides a new world record", etc. Presumably
these are not classed as definitive (tho I'm not sure what to even
look for wrt the IHPVA website these days - but I think Sean Costin
still holds the official record(?) - some kilometres behind the UCI's
record, whereas Gert Jan claims 0.6km beyond it), but interesting
stuff nonetheless....(even if only for the small margins of victory,
perhaps!)

Jim,
I'm platform-independent too.  In fact since I live in a small town I put my 
bikes away completely in the winter and walk/run everywhere - otherwise I'd 
be spending all my time cleaning the bikes (and they'd still dissolve from 
salt every few years).  I agree that UCI has good intentions of making 
cycling a pure sport, and that uniformity of design serves that limited 
purpose.  In most other racing sports there is an unlimited class so that 
arbitrary limits don't stifle design variety.  I guess you could think of 
this as cyclo-diversity.  The current situation I see is that the 
"professional" sanctioning organization won't initiate an unlimited class 
and the "hobbyist" organization doesn't have the revenue to publicize it's 
cyclo-diverse events.

It would make sense to me that the UCI should embrace an unlimited class, 
which only imposes limits for the safety of participants and spectators. 
There may be other options that make as much sense, but I haven't seen one 
yet.  However, UCI dogma is still in the captain's seat (and there is no 
stoker seat on this bike).

Come to think of it, is there even a category for tandem racing in UCI?

btw I'm designing a bike that will be more weatherproof yet light enough for 
the breathtaking WV hills.  That's not getting any financial or moral 
support at the moment either - so it's been languishing because it depends 
on my motivation and availability.  I'll put up newer pictures on my website 
this week.  I'm happy to give away the design - especially when I'm not 
making progress on it.  Oddly enough it hasn't been stolen yet.

Thanks.
Nick

Bicycle racing does have this ambiguity to it, since in one way it is 
about the athlete, but on the other hand the athlete must use someone 
else's equipment to travel in a superhuman manner.  With the tight 
limitation on bike design in place we can maintain a belief that the 
competition is still based on athletic prowess and all the moral things 
we like to associate with it, such as dedication and a willingness to 
overcome pain, etc.  Thus the big flap about who has the better drugs, 
which takes away that moral aspect that makes the riders all the more 
interesting.  By leveling the playing field we can root for a "good guy" 
or a "rebel" or whatever, figuring that who they are has some effect on 
their performance.

While slight variations in bikes' designs let the sponsors fuss about 
their new superbikes, we have seen what full-out design freedom turns 
the event into from our own HPV races.  With fully-faired HPVs being the 
fastest, at least under time trial circumstances, the athletes 
themselves vanish entirely under the skin of the vehicle and the fluid 
engineering takes control.  Not only is it all that is visible, but 
there is the sense that the better designed HPV will win no matter who 
is riding it (as was the case with Faure way back when).  Bike racing 
is, to some degree, a competition between engineers, but this fact is 
far more evident in HPV racing.

The fastest HPVs have other dissatisfying aspects for spectators and 
groupies.  Of course the UCI athletes have teams of mechanics following 
them around in a way that ordinary mortals do not, they still just climb 
on their bike and pedal it the way anyone would.  They don't need a crew 
to tape them up inside the vehicle.

In some ways we might be better off looking at automobile racing as a 
paradigm.  The public seems capable of venerating NASCAR drivers though 
they do little more than concentrate and hold a steering wheel, while it 
is obvious that the driver would be nothing without the engineers and 
mechanics that build the car and keep it going.  HPV racers still deal 
with the suffering the way that auto racers do not.

John,

Are you bating me John?  This is non sequitor, or stating, as a conclusion, something that does not strictly follow from the premise.  It does not follow that because drafting is allowed, the UCI is seemingly not dedicated to measuring rider performance.  It's a given that it is far easier to regulate the hardware aspects of the sport than the race itself.  It is impractical to outlaw drafting in the peloton.  If drafting in all instances were not permitted, there would be no peloton.  Since all participating riders are permitted to draft, drafting is not a "variable" that undermines measurement of athletic performance.  All riders are abiding by the same set of rules and consequently there is a level playing field.  An example of when drafting is not allowed, however, is during the individual time trial ... the race of truth ... the race against the clock.  If a rider catches his leadout man, he is not permitted to draft so that measurement of rider
 performance is ensured.  We have gone off on a tangent here, straying from the original contention that UCI has specific reasons for its regulations ... regulations that will likely forever exclude participation of recumbents from UCI sanctioned events such as the Tour de France.

The time trial bikes are already quite different from the bikes in other stages.  So why not really different?  At least in one stage.  

But, class distinctions and strict regulation and athletic performance aside, bicycle racing has always played a role in the development of the technology of bicycles.  The technology of bicycles is important we can all agree.  I think it is very important.  So I would like to see all types of bicycles tested under conditions representative of contemporary commuting conditions.  And I would like to see that competition well funded.  In the bike world as it is that means the UCI tours.

I mean, really, what would be so bad about one unlimited time trial stage?

Since the UCI's objective its to ensure fair measurement of athletic performance, it logically follows that strict regulation of what is defined as a bicycle is a necessary requirement.  Different classes of competition would only serve to segregate rather than incorporate the recumbent into that main field which is seemingly what some recumbent enthusiasts would prefer.  Regardless, I don't realistically expect the UCI to buy off on different classes.

....no not at all. Allowing drafting seems a bit questionable to me. None of those racers could crank out the speeds and performances without drafting, yet streamlining is banned. 

Of course banning drafting would be impracticable in group rides meaning only time trials would be used. However the viewing public likes the close knit competition of tight groups over the single rider.  So the UCI is influenced by the viewing public?

Hey, I love watching the society of the peloton in action.  The peloton is beautiful, exciting to watch, and efficient. But it does not represent any of the ways that we commute today. Let's not argue whether the recumbent rider could be a member of the peloton society.  

That is why the proposal is restricted to a time trial per tour representative of a commute route in a great city.  

I believe that our recumbent technology with streamlining is important to the future of transportation.  It deserves a place at a big table.

which takes away that moral aspect that makes the riders all the more 
interesting.  By leveling the playing field we can root for a "good guy" 
or a "rebel" or whatever, figuring that who they are has some effect on 
their performance.

While slight variations in bikes' designs let the sponsors fuss about 
their new superbikes, we have seen what full-out design freedom turns 
the event into from our own HPV races.  With fully-faired HPVs being the 
fastest, at least under time trial circumstances, the athletes 
themselves vanish entirely under the skin of the vehicle and the fluid 
engineering takes control.  Not only is it all that is visible, but 
there is the sense that the better designed HPV will win no matter who 
is riding it (as was the case with Faure way back when).  Bike racing 
is, to some degree, a competition between engineers, but this fact is 
far more evident in HPV racing.

Yes - of course - publicly popular events get continued and ones that aren't don't.  Most people don't go to watch time trials - too boring.

Stuart,

I realize that, but some else replied why stop there and many threads before this one have proposed more than and unlimited participation limited to the time trial.  All I was trying to point out was why the UCI have their rules and why these rues are unlikely to change.  What I find odd is that the upright community has little interest in participating in recumbent racing events, but the recumbent riding community is interested in participating in upright racing events.  I've no dog in this fight.  I just don't think I will ever see the day when an open class time trial event will be staged in a major UCI venue like the Tour de France.

Stuart,

Agreed ... time trial bikes are different from the conventional road machine, but even the time trial bike has to conform to strict UCI regulation.

The operative word in one of your sentences are "bicycles tested".  My point was that this is precisely what the UCI is opposed to.  The UCI goal is the testing of rider performance not bicycle performance.  An unlimited (open class) time trial stage I never expect to come to pass.  It runs against the grain of what the UCI stands for.

In 1933, a Frenchman named Marcel Berthet rode a recumbent bike to a new speed record of 50km/h. A furor arose in the UCI.  After considerable debate, the UCI decided in 1934 to outlaw recumbent bicycles from competition in UCI sanctioned events.  I feel that it is unrealistic to expect a reversal of that decision anytime soon.

John,

Having already addressed the drafting issue, I'll not entertain the issue further particularly since that is a tangential issue irrelevant to my original post.

"So the UCI is influenced by the viewing public?" ... is again another conclusion drawn that does not strictly follow from the premise.  If the viewing public had any influence over the UCI, the 1934 ban would have been overturned by those who insist that the recumbent be allowed to participate in UCI sanctioned events.  See my other post for details.

Jim

Gert-Jan's record has been recognised as an unfaired recumbent record by the 
WRRA:

http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wrra/records.asp (seems to be b0rked at the 
moment)

Further than Ondrej Sosenka's Victorian bike record but some way short of 
Boardman's outright best.

The WRRA (Warren Beauchamp, Sean Costin and Yours Truly) was set up a couple 
of years ago to ratify unfaired and part-faired recumbent records, as the 
IHPVA only recognises outright records.

I guess it is time for an update. See 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Human_Powered_Vehicle_Association
for a current description and link list, although this can change any time. 
Basically the old sites are at whpva.org and hpva.us, respectively. HPVA has 
renamed and grabbed ihpva.org. Warren Beauchamp has assembled some old and new 
content there. Warren's recumbents.com site has all the gory details in the 
forum. The Human Power Archive conflict seems resolved and safe either way. 
ICANN is still trying to decide whether the domain name hijack was proper or 
not.  Neil Carter (BHPC) will take over from Brian Wilson whether for ihpva.org 
or whpva.org. We don't yet know what to do with the Wikis, as they use LAMP 
(Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) and BHPC uses Windows thingies. For the English Wikis 
this hardly matters, but the French one has a bit of useful stuff.

Quite. "Best athlete" does not necessarily equal "best [upright]
cyclist" - and I'd happily see the UCI as looking for the latter (as
opposed to the former, at least!)

Well, a bit maybe! I do try to draft behind younger riders at times when 
commuting and certainly do so in group touring which would be too fast for me 
otherwise. I also get a almost totally free ride occasionally when I can "catch" 
a bus.

Let's! High recumbents are not much different from low uprights. But recumbents 
seem to get more benefit from uprights than vice versa.

...

Quite. But we have a long way to go. I only had one ride in a fully faired trike 
in rolling countryside on fast roads in strong winds. It was fast and 
exhilarating! But the same vehicle was next to useless where I live in suburbia: 
too slow and sweaty uphill and too fast downhill. Even tests with assisted 
vehicles were too sweaty for me. But I think this could be solved with active 
ventilation. See for example http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0002/0002.htm

Thank you for asking. The short answer is 'B'. The longer answer is below:

The celebration is for Mochet and recumbents, not UCI.

I spoke to P?r, who originally sparked the idea, today. He will be going to
Paris during the last week (or so) of the Tour de France 2009, and would
like to meet with other recumbent riders there, as many as possible, and
preferably on as many different recumbents as possible.

The idea is to leverage the amount of cycling-journalists and increased
interest in cycling (sports) during Tour de France to raise awareness of

Well, I didn't think changing the UCI would be a roll over as some seem to imply!  But all changes have to start sometime. BTW, since UCI lost direct control of the TdF last year (do I have that right?), I see that Amaury Sport Organization is identified as the TdF organizer

 (http://www.multichannel.com/article/133570-Versus_Rides_To_New_Tour_De_France_Deal.php).

Can someone comment on the current relationships between TdF, Amaury and UCI?

I will continue to follow the speed record heroes, Whittingham and Georgiev and Zabovnik and all the others, on the web with an occasional brief mention in the conventional media; and I will watch the tours for hours on Versus cable TV channel here in the States, and I will repair and ride my old faired Infinity.  If I lived in Europe I would love to help Torben and P?r with their project in person.  Can anything be done in virtuality?

Thank you for asking. The short answer is 'B'. The longer answer is below:

The celebration is for Mochet and recumbents, not UCI.

I spoke to P?r, who originally sparked the idea, today. He will be going to
Paris during the last week (or so) of the Tour de France 2009, and would
like to meet with other recumbent riders there, as many as possible, and
preferably on as many different recumbents as possible.

The idea is to leverage the amount of cycling-journalists and increased
interest in cycling (sports) during Tour de France to raise awareness of
recumbents as an alternative to the UCI-sanctioned roadracers. He also
wants to honour the gentlemen Mochet, in their home land, for their efforts
in the 1930s to develop their recumbent bikes and to actually improve them
to the point where a "good" rider could beat "great" riders on traditional
bikes. This of course led to the UCI defining bicycles in a more strict

If anyone wanted to make a true PR impact with recumbents during the  
Tour it would have to be well-organized.

Do other bike interest groups ever use the Tour to get coverage for  
their special interest? Or at least attention? If so, then HPVs  
should do what they do.

To have real impact, again, one would truly get a lot of bents---of  
the best, fastest, coolest-looking, most reliable, easiest-to-use,  
safest, best to mix in with uprights (perhaps) kinds---onto the roads  
nearest the most journalists and the HPV event organizer would surely  
hold as many press conferences as possible. They'd also host an open  
(free) bar.

You wouldn't want duffers toodling around on gimcrack rigs that  
they're constantly stopping to tape or wire together.

You want speed, style, simplicity...the works....on display.

Perhaps a city-circuit criterium in a neighborhood of Paris with both  
uprights and a variety of 'bents in the race would be of interest.  
This event should pass by the front of the bar where the free drinks  
and press conference will be held.

Someone should ride a replica Mochet --- it's still a great design,  
I'd think --- its rider did 27 miles in the Hour --- a fine pace!  
Make one in ti or carbon.

It has to be official, pro and according to protocol.

Lots of sweet bikes, a sweet event, a pro media kit, Q&A, and free  
drinks.

Oh, and there needs to be a simple point to the event. Is there a  
demand? UCI ban on WHAT. What rule to overturn. And be replaced by  
what. Should fairings be legal in the TdF? Rear fairings?

Another event could be organized on one of the steepest Alps climbs  
to show how viable 'bents are in all-round racing.

Have a fleet of 'benters ride one of the more diverse stages after/ 
before the racers. Then meet the media after with a report on their  
elapsed time as compared to the pro's. Ideally, include a stage with  
climbs, wind, rain and cobbles.

Grab Graham Watson ... supply him with endless rolls of film and the motorbike ... get a lasting vision, the race is over pretty quick.
 
When a pro like him is chasing things going 50-mph/80-kph on the flats instead of 30-mph/50-kph they can get talking amongst the pro's who I'm sure wouldn't mind upping the speed records if they get interested.
 
And then there's Lance ... he's not getting paid to race so why not try to wrangle him into a streamliner for a "test" ride??tom mallard    .net web applications       consumer product design> From: jeff at outyourbackdoor.com> Date: Wed, 21 Jan 2009 15:39:44 -0500> To: hpv at bikelist.org> Subject: Re: [hpv] 75 years of UCI ban> > If anyone wanted to make a true PR impact with recumbents during the > Tour it would have to be well-organized.> > Do other bike interest groups ever use the Tour to get coverage for > their special interest?

Jeff,

A much more sensible and pragmatic approach ... more of what I would have in mind if I intended to organize such an event.  Ignore the UCI like the UCI has ignore the recumbent.  Do you own thing in your own style ... a venue that would effectively get the word out.  If that's the purpose, do what is most likely to achieve your objective ... do what is likely to work rather than what had been proven not to ... beating on the door of the UCI.

Jim McNamara

Thorben Thellefsen,
 
Thanks for qualifying the intent of the idealist.
 
I too like all the options of the variety of bents.  If fact, for many of us, 
we need the alternative riding ergonomics provided by recumbents to continue 
riding.  These ergonomic positions do not always generate higher speed 
potential.  The fact that the most aero positions possible for a human body to move 
through the air end up being that of the recumbent is just physically defined.  
It isn't about preference or rule.
 
Mike

Yeah, make inroads to the UCI or whomever by way of the media and the  
public. Go to where the people and the media are and show them---in a  
pro fashion---what you mean.
