I was surprised to see this as well. Apparently the Cervelo team has been using them for awhile.

I think Wiggins and Froome use these:

I don't know about that, but other 'bent racers have used them with mixed results. Spinners in particular seem to have difficulty getting used to them. 

This recent thread on BROL suggests that the age-old debate about how to orient them carries on. Sounds like Q rings and Osymetric have opposite philosophies?

Like womens skirt lengths and financial recessions these non-round chainrings show up on an every fifteen to twenty years cycle:-) 

Just long enough for psychological extinction to set in from the last time they were tried. The difference this time seems to be the PowerTap and other measurement methods can be seen to show an improvement under  some real world conditions for the first time instead of the usual reliance on endorsements or theoretical calculations only for their sales. The problem of adapting human leg anatomy to the sinusoidal crank is real, but generally compensated sufficiently by the ankle.  Perhaps we've finally demonstrated these devices efficacy over compensatory training routines that sometimes fall apart under maximum stress.

  Of course, there could still be the placebo effect at work as these are human beings being tested.  The churlish nature in me makes me also consider the possibility of patent expirations playing into the appearance of these devices at this time. Could the strict drug testing in the Tour at this time also have led towards searching out a mechanical advantage that fits UCI rules once again?

I swapped out the 53 tooth chainring on my electric assist recumbent five
weeks ago.  I put on a 52 tooth Sugino Cycloid, elliptical ring, I once had
on a fixie.  Set it up as close as I could to the Q ring instructions,
given that I only had five options.  Felt smoother, easier on my knees, so
it stays.

I'm up to 4622 miles as of this afternoon.  A small electric motor run
through the gears and a LiFePO4 battery, makes a recumbent the perfect
vehicle....period.  Now if only the cars would all get melted down for
cookware!

Watching the Tour de France as usual, I noticed for the first time: 
elliptical chainrings in the last time trial, especially on the bikes of 
Wiggins and Froome in yesterday's time trial.  Due to my out-of-it status, 
I'm sure, but a na?ve question:  Does Sam Whittingham and the other Battle 
Mtn battlers ride with ellipticals?
