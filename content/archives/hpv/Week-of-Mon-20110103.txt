Good morning,
More than 10 years ago I was vigorously writing a bike simulation 
program and had gotten to the point where I could put in routes so you 
could (virtually) ride a bike over the route and the program would tell 
you how long the ride took and how much energy was used.  I stopped 
development because I couldn't get real-world routes (GPS was just 
becoming available, but not affordable for me).  Today I came across a 
website that gives me the data I need off the internet.
ridewithgps.com
Buy downloading the route in Garmin "Training Center" format (.tcx) I 
can see the data I need in ASCII format.  However, to load it into my 
program I still need to put the data in columns and convert lat/lon/alt 
to xyz.  The .tcx format is a markup language like html.  I've found 
formulas for the lat/lon conversion part.  Can anyone an easy way to do 
the data reading part?   My only known approach would be to use 
QuickBASIC like I did 15 years ago.  I'm hoping for something better.

Even better, I remember someone on this list at the time developed an 
online simulation.  If that person is still around, do you know if there 
is a way to integrate that simulation with this online route mapping 
utility.  My premise is that you would input vehicle characteristics 
(rolling coeff, drag coeff, weight, mech eff) and rider characteristics 
(weight, power, cadence) and the program would give you a time history 
of speed, acceleration and energy used.

Anyone interested in working on this with me, I can do all the physics 
stuff but I'm not sure how to do the terrain data reading and 
input/output graphics,?
Thanks,
Nick

Somebody beat you to it, there is a program called Google Bike that
uses Google Earth and a bike trainer to create a virtual bike ride.
The on-road images are taken from Street View. I haven't tried it yet
so I can't say anything about the motion of the video if it is as
choppy as hitting Forward on Street View or if they have somehow
blended it so that it moves smoothly.

I ride my bike to ride my bike, and sometimes it takes me where I need to go.

Nick, the RIdeWithGPS programmers are local (to me)... Oregon for sure, probably Portland. You could ask them about pulling terrain data from routes posted on their site. From what I've seen it's all XML, so it's really a matter of getting the input data correctly formatted and then the programming should be straightforward from there.  As Opie points out, Google Street View does a reasonably good job on the output side.

Several of the WISIL guys have been talking about virtual online races in this thread: http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3133 . I haven't worked with any of this stuff, but it sounds like they're using what you're describing. 

FWIW-  here's a couple routes that I've created:

http://ridewithgps.com/routes/132998

Good morning,
I received a couple of responses on this topic yesterday and I'm not 
sure they went to the general list so I thought I'd summarize them here.

- A couple of people are working on an interactive online bike simulation.
- There is a hack to do it really simply by soldering a speedometer 
detector to the up arrow  USB game controller.  You can do this in 
Google Streetview.  It will advance you along the path that your mouse 
is on.  I imagine there are ways to hack into a joystick to get 
left/right control
- Last nite I finished writing a small program to extract the 
lat/long/alt values from a .tcx file and output them in ft as x, y, 
distance and height from the starting point.  The data comes out as 
columns that can be used easily by other programs.  I wrote the program 
in QuickBASIC because that's what I had and it's free, but you're 
welcome to the code if you want to translate it into something else.

I've put some explanation and pictures on my blog at
