I know John Tetz has used small motors, but I don't see how you could  
get this to work in a downtube.

Real, or late April fools?

Harder than hiding the physical motor and battery pack would be hiding
the 2.2 pounds of mass. The bikes these guys are riding are about 14
pounds, so that difference would be about 16% which would be easy for
an official to spot. It would take quite a bit of slight-of-hand to
sub one in during a race. But who knows?

....actually its more like 4. 4 pounds. The motor assembly they report on weighs 900 gms and the battery 1000 gms. 
Hiding that battery would be the tough one. 

I think the noise would alert anyone near the vehicle so it couldn't be used in a group. 

Their planetary gear box is about the same size as mine which can handle the 100 input watts so I wonder how their gear box can handle the 200 input watts reliably. 

They say the output is 100 watts which gives an efficiency around 50% which I find is about right for this kind of system.
