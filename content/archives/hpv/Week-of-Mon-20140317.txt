Folks,

I have about a 75 pound collection of hpv event VHS videos, all the HPV
News and Human Power Journals, IHPVA Scientific Symposium Proceedings,
Cycling Science mag, Encycleopedia, Bike Culture mag, Recumbent UK mag,
RCN, etc.  Is there any organization that would be interested in taking all
this stuff?
