<PRE>Good morning,
I received a couple of responses on this topic yesterday and I'm not 
sure they went to the general list so I thought I'd summarize them here.

- A couple of people are working on an interactive online bike simulation.
- There is a hack to do it really simply by soldering a speedometer 
detector to the up arrow  USB game controller.  You can do this in 
Google Streetview.  It will advance you along the path that your mouse 
is on.  I imagine there are ways to hack into a joystick to get 
left/right control
- Last nite I finished writing a small program to extract the 
lat/long/alt values from a .tcx file and output them in ft as x, y, 
distance and height from the starting point.  The data comes out as 
columns that can be used easily by other programs.  I wrote the program 
in QuickBASIC because that's what I had and it's free, but you're 
welcome to the code if you want to translate it into something else.

I've put some explanation and pictures on my blog at
www.positivespinwv.blogspot.com
