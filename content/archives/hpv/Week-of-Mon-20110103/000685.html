<PRE>Good morning,
More than 10 years ago I was vigorously writing a bike simulation 
program and had gotten to the point where I could put in routes so you 
could (virtually) ride a bike over the route and the program would tell 
you how long the ride took and how much energy was used.  I stopped 
development because I couldn't get real-world routes (GPS was just 
becoming available, but not affordable for me).  Today I came across a 
website that gives me the data I need off the internet.
ridewithgps.com
Buy downloading the route in Garmin &quot;Training Center&quot; format (.tcx) I 
can see the data I need in ASCII format.  However, to load it into my 
program I still need to put the data in columns and convert lat/lon/alt 
to xyz.  The .tcx format is a markup language like html.  I've found 
formulas for the lat/lon conversion part.  Can anyone an easy way to do 
the data reading part?   My only known approach would be to use 
QuickBASIC like I did 15 years ago.  I'm hoping for something better.

Even better, I remember someone on this list at the time developed an 
online simulation.  If that person is still around, do you know if there 
is a way to integrate that simulation with this online route mapping 
utility.  My premise is that you would input vehicle characteristics 
(rolling coeff, drag coeff, weight, mech eff) and rider characteristics 
(weight, power, cadence) and the program would give you a time history 
of speed, acceleration and energy used.

Anyone interested in working on this with me, I can do all the physics 
stuff but I'm not sure how to do the terrain data reading and 
input/output graphics,?
Thanks,
Nick
