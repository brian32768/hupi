<PRE>Nick, the RIdeWithGPS programmers are local (to me)... Oregon for sure, probably Portland. You could ask them about pulling terrain data from routes posted on their site. From what I've seen it's all XML, so it's really a matter of getting the input data correctly formatted and then the programming should be straightforward from there.  As Opie points out, Google Street View does a reasonably good job on the output side.

Several of the WISIL guys have been talking about virtual online races in this thread: <A HREF="http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3133">http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3133</A> . I haven't worked with any of this stuff, but it sounds like they're using what you're describing. 

FWIW-  here's a couple routes that I've created:

</I>&gt;<i> QuickBASIC like I did 15 years ago.  I'm hoping for something better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even better, I remember someone on this list at the time developed an

</I>&gt;<i> is a way to integrate that simulation with this online route mapping 
</I>&gt;<i> utility.  My premise is that you would input vehicle characteristics 
</I>&gt;<i> (rolling coeff, drag coeff, weight, mech eff) and rider characteristics 
</I>&gt;<i> (weight, power, cadence) and the program would give you a time history 
</I>&gt;<i> of speed, acceleration and energy used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone interested in working on this with me, I can do all the physics 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff but I'm not sure how to do the terrain data reading and 
</I>&gt;<i> input/output graphics,?
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
