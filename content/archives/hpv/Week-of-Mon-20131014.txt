Toss out the back seat and replace it with 300 pounds of LiFePO4 cells
and you would have a car you could almost drive until the driver
collapsed from exhaustion/sleep deprivation.

"Quick mention that a major deal is to switch away from fossil for

The best way to do that is algae, people in areas are growing it for
biodiesel in blue-tarp lined pits, luv the internet, pressing it in cloth

for cooking and heating as well."

My biologist buddy sez:

Growing algae and making biodiesel, using wastewater as the source of
nutrients is a great idea; really a good cleaner of water, as long as there
is very little of the various heavy metals in the sewage (one of the
biggest problems in using any sewage product).  I can't imagine that this
will ever be used as a major source of fuel, though.  Even though algae is
more efficient than terrestrial plants, the equipment needs are huge.   The
only way to get a decent yield is to use pure strains of certain species,
or even genetically engineered types.  That means growing inside a
sterilizable system, like glass pipes--enormously expensive!  Growing in
open systems means you get whatever wants to grow there, and those species
just wont make much at all, but are still good at sucking up wasted
nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

So a far better use of sewage than growing algae for fuel is using it as a
source of nutrients to grow crop plants.  Nitrogen fertilizer production is
one of the biggest energy users on the planet, but we just throw most of it
into our water systems when it runs off agricultural fields or inadequate
city sewage plants, and then into the ocean, where it causes algal blooms
there, destroying those ecosystems.   Phosphorus is even a bigger issue
than nitrogen--it's all mined, and a large fraction comes from places that
don't like us very much.  At the rate we are using it, we don't have enough
for farming to finish out the century.   Well-designed sewage treatment
plants, for cities as well as for farm runoff, could use algae to recover
nearly all phosphorus (and most other plant nutrients).

....if you did the math....

photosynthesis, at best, is maybe 5% efficient at harvesting solar energy,
 and then converting that to stored energy, like oil, is at best 2%
efficient (cells have their own energy needs).  So how many thousand acres
of glass pipes would it take to provide all of a town's fuel needs?  (I
don't know, but you get the picture).  Is a fantasy, like using fast-food
grease to supply us with all our transportation needs.   Or, if we just all
stopped using those electric toothbrushes, our energy problems would be
solved!

(but that rancid crap from Burger King works to power my tractor, and a
couple of other people's tractors, and keeps it from fouling sewage plants).

To clarify two points easily mistaken in my message: I moved to my Costa Mesa CA location within walking distance  48 years ago because I was on a swing shift and going to school full time days. The commute by motor scooter was killing me, or at least threatening to with the dense tule fog in the bean fields I passed through after midnight to get home. No I am not a professional, but I did succeed in getting a retirement after 35 years service to one company that moved my work place several times ending up in Santa Barbara where I took my early retirement in 1999. While I was a glorified technician who acquired the job description of 'Development Engineer' despite not finishing an undergraduate degree, I admit to being quite lucky in the timing of my career to have those privileges along the way. At each of those increasingly distant job locations I was able to commute by bicycle at least once a month. At Santa Barbara, I took a local rental with my Costa Mesa home rented out which allowed me to bike commute several times a week.

Having retired early I rode my modified F-40 across the U.S. but when I returned I was given the chance to help form a new company. The downside was the fifty miles (each way) to get there. While I was certain in those Dot.Com days that the job would only last two years before going bust, for me it lasted six years and is still going, thankfully without my help. I only did the bike commute on 'bike to work' days in those years.
 I commend you for doing the bermed solar passive home and accepting the consequences. Once I realized the benefits of the close proximity to the sea that I attained here in the OC, I became determined to hold on in this location(Santa Barbara would have been better, but beyond just about anybody in my income level who didn't buy there in the fifties). I live not quite so frugally, by having purchased a Duplex Apartment in which I rent out one unit and live in the other. It pays for itself and so I can stay here in this quite temperate climate on SS  income alone. Here in CA we have multiple solar industries competing to provide PV rooftop systems at no cost through State subsidies and public utility legislative connivances. Quite interestingly, I cannot meet their criteria because I don't use enough electricity. I cannot yet justify an electric car as i do local shopping  by bike but as grid connected solar is not feasible (not even if combined with my tenants usage, were that allowed) I am considering an electric car eventually which could justify the PV system. I already have installed a Thermal Solar array serving 100% of my hot water needs, and adding some better insulation to my north facing walls will allow most of my winter heating to be a byproduct of the stucco and thick plaster which serve as generally sufficient thermal mass because of the 'short thermometer' in this coastal community.

Last weekend I visited the  DOE Solar Decathlon this year held in nearby Irvine,CA. Most of those very well thought out Solar homes are about the same size as my 1950's vintage digs because of price constraints in the competition rules. While the winner was from Austria, just about all of them came fairly close to the goal of zero to positive energy production with modern comfort standards. The interesting fact for me was that they did this all without fossil fuels and using less efficient electric appliances.  Several were able to support solar carport charging of  commercial EV's on top of the zero fuel use. The 'Cruiser Class' in the Australian contest could have a place in our fuel less ideal future, but only for those in the "outback" who need the turtle-like ability get long distances rather slowly from their off grid locations.

 I like to joke with my rich Newport Beach neighbors at or near sea level that their profligate lifestyles will soon go away with sea level rise and it will be me that has near seafront property. Of course I will need my sailboat because the Mesa I live on will be an island.

we move all the non-HPV stuff elsewhere.  Anybody have suggestions as to
where?  Anyway, I'll be sticking to HPV content.

If true, the demise of RCN (Recumbent Cycling News) has to be one of the
causes.  BentRider Online is great, and the recumbent crowd is definitely
computer savvy, but getting reviews (and ads) every month on paper had to
have helped sales.

It seems that the bike manufacturers disagreed with me as they failed to
support it by purchasing enough advertising.

I wonder what happened to Bob Bryant?

First, riding a bike & not owning a car are steps in the right direction so that's me, yet until all the IC-engines on the planet run a green fuel, game over, we need to chop CO2 emissions to zero or get close to halt the obvious possible negative results of not dropping it. 
 
So, hybrid vehicles are very important and hpv's are part of hybrids, being into frame design I think we need a design rating idea up front, that is to know which hybrids are lousy hpv's to ride no-power so users are prone to use assist too often against those that ride well.  To me that quality of riding well shouldn't be classed with hybrids that don't, having a discussion on this issue seem valid here to improve the development of hpv +assist, and avoid assist +hpv.
 
Then for algae to biofuel, scaled to city size it's not practical to extract toxins using chemicals cheaply but when you drink city water as reports indicate they are not fully removed, so, to me that implies the primary purpose of treating wastewater needs to be purification of the water, then as an intended consequence using algae to do the main cleaning you get the biodiesel but no fertilizer for cities, digesting the tainted leftovers for methane and have the least toxic waste to dispose of.
 
Since in poor areas of the world people are making biodiesel from algae in blue tarps over pits dug into the ground, really small engines are far better a match than electrics. Along those lines my own ideas for hpv-assist using a fuel have been a turbine in a hub using a fluid transmission to "step down" the "gear" while allowing the chain to add power as well.
 
If you look at model airplane engines by power rating they are tiny for 1.5-2 HP, so are small turbines ... later on that, needs money but that's the least intrusive addition as a strategy for a hybrid so far for me, use a different hub for the drive wheel and make it weigh no more than a good 7sp or more internal hub.
 
With one of these rear wheels home-brew biodiesel from blue tarps can make enough to never need to buy fuel for many people.

No one will pay for content, including 'bent riders, so RCN went the way of many print publications. People expect everything to be online, and free. 

The commercial recumbent market has made a big shift to trikes, and seems to be doing as well as it ever did, if not better.

......Seems to me that concern for the environment and HPVs can be so 
closely related that it would be a shame to separate them.
Their designs and the way we use them can affect the environment.

I am happy to learn what our HPV members are thinking and doing about the 
environment by the type of vehicle they choose to use.
I can and do go to environmental sites but then I loose the closer 
connections to HPV types and what they are experiencing.

And disusing only HPVs can become for me too disconnected from the 
environment and often shows in the vehicles that is being talked about.

My present HPV is used to do practically all my local shopping and running 
errands. Its design was influenced 10 years ago by speed and streamlining 
which isn't as useful for practicality. But what I have learned from my own 
experiences and learning from others, is going into a new design.

Yes if our environmental discussions take over for too long then again its 
not including the vehicle design.

May I suggest that we have a topic (or separate list) called
"Transportation Hacks" to encompass ideas and experiences that could lead
to better transportation for everyone?  I got the idea from a TED talk list
I've been watching this week called Life Hacks.

The list has been so quiet for the last few years that it's nice to see any discussion relating to low impact transportation. No sense fragmenting things.

The MnHPVA meetings are more about electric assist than pedal power now that we're getting older. I hope to make it well past 70 before I have to worry about controllers etc. But it's nice to know my club mates will have it all figured out when it's my turn.

We actually visited Japan, some years ago.  I didn't use the underground
parking machines,

but we went to a multiplex movie theater, with a three story bicycle
parking garage.

Like every culture, they don't do everything logically though.  We saw
thousands of nearly identical mama charies,

all with the seat set too low for proper leg extension.  This is to allow
getting your feet down in a hurry which, in the crowded streets, they must
do frequently.  But it means they mostly stand to get started, and ride
around with their knees coming up to their chins.  It would make more sense
to ride feet forward bikes, but they would be a bit longer.  Space is at a
premium, I suppose, and if you rode one, you would stand out...not good.

All these bikes have kickstands, and in many places there are no bike
racks.  So they are lined up, by the dozens, in rows on the sidewalk.  It
wasn't unusual to see an entire line flopped over, like dominoes, people
patiently untangling their bikes.

Mark,

Do you guys have a current site where you have stuff from your meetings?  I
can't even get to the old site directly, as Google insists it has malware,
which we pay Norton to deal with, so I don't see what biz it is of
Google's, except that they want to run the planet.  I really miss the great
innovations that used to show up at those meetings.

Thanks Warren for the Japanese bike parking issues.

I have seen bike parking problems in several cities in Europe.

I hear that in China they are banning bikes on certain roads because they 
get in the way of cars.

Oh to have these "PROBLEMS" here in the US.

Unfortunately, the latest Nova show is all about going faster.  If you
obsessively troll the EV sites, like I do, you will find that, unlike much
of the EV talk in past decades, it is all about 0-60 times, and smoking
tires.  Any talk of slowing down is seen as defeatist.  When we dumped the
55 mph speed limit, conventional economists applauded raising speed limits
as good for GDP.  These are the same clowns who said moving manufacturing
out of the country would be good for the GDP.  So we drive farther and
farther, faster and faster, for less and less inflation adjusted income.
 How high would we need to raise the speed limit to balance our trade
deficit?  :-(

This afternoon I was looking through a fat, dusty, manila folder marked
ELECTRIC.  It is full of magazine, and newspaper articles about electric
vehicles, going back to the 1970's, and a 1986 Molicel rechargeable lithium
cell catalog, I had sent away to Canada for.  Seeing yellowed clippings
about the original Solar Challenge, almost three decades ago, talking about
how "soon" these advances will see us reducing our exhaust emissions, and
oil consumption was pretty discouraging, as today I read articles about how
"by 2040 most Americans will be driving electric cars."  Of course,
scientists are also saying by then climate change will beyond hope of
stopping.

I was delighted to see this show give high profile attention to recumbents, the Delft team and Battle Mountain, and the White Zombie electric car.  All very cool technologies that impress even the hard core conventionals that dominate our society (when has it been different?).  Heck, 83 mph even impresses roadies.

Highly recommended.

And the sailing shots were spectacular!  It's interesting to me how the America's cup rules have evolved over the years to accommodate the most radical of sailing designs, while the UCI has stagnated for many decades.  Having the winner decide the rules seems to have made a radical difference in approach.

The only way to slow down what's going on in the atmosphere is a cheap biofuel for all the IC-engines on the planet any style, at least Tesla is putting up an image that appeals to the muscle car crowd, that's a real achievement for marketing EV's, a tipping point, but EV's will never do anything about the real problem with IC-engines.
 
Consider that about 50,000 new cars & trucks hit the streets in China daily, we have to switch fuels, there are no alternatives to dropping emissions, switching fuels is mandatory.

Yeah, researching cutaway front ends like Windcheetah but for tubing, if you raise the downtube above the chainrings like a polo bike of the 80's it's almost 1-mph faster average speed by removing a huge source of turbulence where the dt meets the bb ... if that's done to cheap bikes it saves the average commuter calories per day, if you scale that it's a lot of food saved daily by simply moving the tube up, and the people get there a bit faster.
 
The frame doesn't need any other change to gain this advantage. I sent in a letter to the UCI to state that in their rules so non-racers would know that unless you race in UCI events there's no reason to go slow, no reply.

I think people expected the batteries to be further along by now.  I think the only reason I see them on the street every day is combination  of incentives and subsidies. I think there are extra ones here in California. 

Yesterday I saw two electric Fiat 500s. I saw these being tested. Lots of people use the Jones St hill in San Francisco for stress tests. But these seemed to be in the wild. 

I never would have predicted that the #1 status car for silicon valley VCs would be an electric (the Tesla). 

Back to something I know a bit more about; I am surprised that there is any market at all for electric bikes, given the prices, and the numerous reports of problems.  They cost as much as gas scooters, but I suspect the lack of gas, license, and insurance costs must be an incentive, maybe more so in Europe.

Lots of flashy technology - but really still stuck in 19th century thinking.  SPEED 

Hey news reporters, we are in the 21st century !!!!!!  Different values needed. 

The Delft vehicle took a team of people and all kinds of technical machinery. 
George Georgief has held the records for many many years and he did it by himself, no fancy equipment. When I visited him on his island home off the coast of Vancouver I looked for drawings and such - there were non to be found. He uses his hands and eyes as guides. 

This is a wonderful story that the public should know about.  


I think I saw a millisecond view of Georges face congratulating the Delft team. That's typical of good hearted George.

Yup.  People were expecting batteries to save them, or biofuels, or fusion.
 Surely something will come along.  It always does...until it doesn't.
 Fossil fuels were a one time gift.  Two billion people could have lived
like kings for a thousand years on all the cheap energy.  Instead we bred,
and fought over distribution of resources like the animals we are.
