Subject: [hpv] Human powered flywheel motor concept
Message-ID: <4AB6521D.6080101@cs.cmu.edu>

The recent edition of HUMAN POWER (Number 58 Summer 2009)has an article 
"Application of Human Powered Flywheel Motor as an Energy Source for 
Generation of Electrical Energy for Rural Applications, and Computer 
Aided Analysis of Battery Charging Process" by Deshpande, Modak and 
Tarnekar. Based on this article and the references cited, the 
authors--most notably Modak--have done extensive research in applying 
human power to many applications, a laudable pursuit.

What puzzles me, however, is the claim that *human pedallers can produce 
five times the average power by sprinting for 60 seconds then resting 
for 15 seconds, vs. pedalling continuously.* (See p11 first paragraph.) 
Am I misinterpreting this? The references cited to back up this claim 
are mostly by the authors themselves, except for ref. 17, attributed to 
Eastman-Kodak. Some web searching turned up the the articles listed 
below among others, but in brief review, I did not find data to support 
the claim.

If there is any truth to this claim, it would dramatically change the 
way we think about and design human-powered vehicles and devices. Can 
anyone comment on this? (Are the authors listening?) I would love to see 
data supporting this.

	Thanks, Ben

Very interesting.  This is the way I pedal.... crank really hard for a
minute or two, go easy and catch my breath for 15-20 seconds, and then crank
it back up.  I'm almost 200 lbs, so I carry a flywheel with me wherever I
go.

Isn't this similar to what the endurence electric and gas folks do with 
their machines to get more mpg or equivalent?  I have seen similar statements 
before with different time intervals of pedal vs power.  Most of report 
riding on rollers(repeating hills allows greater speed, though should have a 
higher cost because of inefficiency climbing I would think.
Interesting to consider...
I have done something similar in time trials...I thought it was bad 
conditioning and poor training and strategy when I coasted and gasped then pedalled 
again...Yes, now I can say it it is my intent;-).  You guys just need to 
give me the science now.
 
Jim, you keep that mass of yours spinning?  Mine is just molded into the 
seat...
