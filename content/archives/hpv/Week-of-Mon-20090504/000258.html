<PRE>It's been a long time passing since I've looked at the IHPVA email 
lists. It got a bit crazy but still interesting in early 2000s, and HPV 
email moved to another email server clumsily. As a computer tech, I 
appreciated the problems, but was saddened to see things go downhill on 
the email lists.

A little later I was banned from using my Trice recumbent trike on the 
hometown job. I bought a motorcycle-sidecar outfit to at least get some 
fresh air on the job, and really cut back on cycling. (Employer requires 
a legal gasoline powered vehicle apparently.) The sidecar mc gets as 
good gas mileage as the latest &quot;hybrids&quot; around town and on the freeway, 
is lots more interesting for daily transportation, and in California I 
don't need a special &quot;motorcycle license&quot; to drive 3-wheel motor 
vehicles :)

20+ years of bicycling on public roads as an adult has taught me how to 
be careful on a motorcycle. The outfit is actually a little safer 
because drivers can &quot;see me&quot; (I don't look like a narrow sign or bush on 
the roadside), I travel at traffic speeds in a wide lane, I don't have a 
narrow 2-3' wide lane in debris to travel in, and crazy motorists are 
afraid to be nasty to me because I might be a &quot;motorcycle gang member&quot; 
and can catch up to them :)

Man, the mid 90's and early 2k's were exciting times for US IHPVA email 
lists. Lots of new tech and manufacturers coming out and mentioned on 
the various lists, from around the world.

I'm getting close to retiring, and will probably get a modern Trice 
(with rear shock) for around-town transport and recreation rides. 
Though, the sidecar mc outfit is pretty cool for quicker longer distance 
travel, and I use lots less non-renewable resources than driving my 6cyl 
Ford pickup.

I don't even know if this msg will get thru to the current email list, 
or deleted because it mentions &quot;motorcycle&quot; :)
