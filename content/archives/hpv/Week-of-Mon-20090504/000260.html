<PRE>I want to thank everyone who responded to my request for ideas.  I was so interested in how motorcycles had converted to trikes by adding outboard wheels that I really didn't stop to analyze if it would work on a recumbent bike.  I just went to work.  However, I learned a lot and had a lot of fun.  So now I will convert the frame and wheels into a trailer.

I built a wooden low racer a couple of years back that was a blast to ride and fun to build.  Maybe I can use the plans from Atomic Zombie's DeltaRunner Recumbent trike and build it out of wood.  <A HREF="http://www.atomiczombie.com/product-deltarunner.htm">http://www.atomiczombie.com/product-deltarunner.htm</A>

Again, thanks to all.

GRR, Kettwiesel, Vision Metro and now a new trailer.
