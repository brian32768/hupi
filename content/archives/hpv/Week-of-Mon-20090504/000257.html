<PRE>The Vision has a fairly high CG, so that is likely part of the tipping 
problem. A vehicle like this tips on a line between the outermost wheels, so 
having the outrigger wheels behind the rear wheel angles the tip line closer 
in. The best place, tip-wise, for the outriggers is due outside to slightly 
forward of the CG. This is because tipovers often involve braking while 
cornering.

I've done some stabilizer/outrigger wheels for people with balance issues, 
and another problem is high centering the drive wheel. This might be solved 
by suspending either the drive wheel or the outrigger wheels. You of course 
want to make sure you never high center the steering wheel!

The best overall solution, I think, is to go with a proper tricycle. There 
are enough options nowadays that you can find something ready made for a 
decent price that will probably do what you need with only minimal 
modifications. The trike rear section that Sun (J&amp;B Importers in the USA) 
sells is a good option if you want to convert an existing bicycle. In order 
to provide spares, J&amp;B sells any part of any bike/trike they make. Most 
shops in the USA are hooked up with J&amp;B, so it's not too difficult to get 
stuff like this here in the States.
