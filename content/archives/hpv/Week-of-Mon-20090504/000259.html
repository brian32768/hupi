</I>Not just technical problems, of course. The IHPVA/WHPVA rift showed me 
that registrars/providers/hosts based in the USA - which unfortunately 
includes ICANN itself - and conforming to the USA legal system are risky 
to use for those with let us say a European-type legal outlook. These 
differences of opinion are certainly a factor which lead to frequent 
changes of addresses and servers.

</I>Thanks for documenting this on your website (www.lenk.net)! Again, it 
seems to me a peculiar legal problem. I guess your employer can specify 
the vehicle to use if this is required to do your job properly, but go 
no further then that. Over here, a rural postman in private initiative 
delivers post with an electric scooter and trailer instead of the 
standard stinker, with support from the &quot;post office&quot;, even though the 
scooter model he uses cannot legally pull a trailer. I guess you could 
have sued your employer, but would have been jobless afterwards.

&gt;<i> I don't even know if this msg will get thru to the current email list, 
</I>&gt;<i> or deleted because it mentions &quot;motorcycle&quot; :)
</I>Howabout *this* motorcycle:
