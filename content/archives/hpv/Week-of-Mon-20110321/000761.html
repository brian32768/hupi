Easy racer doesn't use parts exactly like this, but they do use solid 3/8&quot; rod on their Cobra seat.  They've been using the machined clamps for a while, although I think they subcontract the machining of those to someone else.  Rotator used similar clamps, but I don't know if Steve made them himself or not.

Steve was known for using tubing (e.g. hose) clamps and was often criticized by Bob Bryant of RCN.  Steve's hose clamps were actually high quality stainless steel, and they work well without harming the tubing.  I've never had a good hose clamp fail or prove inadequate to the job, except for the one time I overtorqued one of the small clamps when tightening it, stripping it out.

On neither my Rotator or Easy Racer bike have I come close to bending the seat stays.  Might have something to do with the angle of the stays and whether the stay is in-line with the force applied to the seat back.

&gt;<i> I was riding it in Scotland and pushed hard to take off and the legs on the

</I>&gt;<i> continue riding, but have been reluctant to put power into the seat back
</I>&gt;<i> ever since.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just passing this along. I vowed to build something stronger like maybe
</I>&gt;<i> using steel tubing instead of a solid rod on my return home but have never
</I>&gt;<i> done it. My power output has dropped so much since then though that I might
</I>&gt;<i> not be able to bend the stays like that again.

Aluminum tubing 1/2&quot; O.D. ought to be sturdy enough.  Steel will be too heavy or too thin.
