<PRE>I was unaware Easy Racers used parts like this. Not surprising since Rotator
built bikes for both ER and Lightning. My &quot;composite&quot; bike uses a BikeE
frame and a Lightning Stealth seat, and was built by Rotator so it has the
&quot;pi&quot; shaped bracket.

I was riding it in Scotland and pushed hard to take off and the legs on the
pi bent into a neat U shape, instantly giving the bike more of a lowracer
seating position. I was able to bend them up relatively straight and
continue riding, but have been reluctant to put power into the seat back
ever since.

Just passing this along. I vowed to build something stronger like maybe
using steel tubing instead of a solid rod on my return home but have never
done it. My power output has dropped so much since then though that I might
not be able to bend the stays like that again.
