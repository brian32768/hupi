</I>Non-motorized. I mean these folding aluminium jobs with skate wheels. In 
comparison to most bicycles, they are shoddily built and have poor 
braking. It is easy to go faster than &quot;safe&quot; on steep gradients (I do so 
almost daily ;-) ). In Switzerland they are legal on sidewalks and on 
streets with little traffic. Relatively little seems to happen, 
presumably because the perception of unsaftey is higher than actual 
unsafety. The same would apply to skateboards, where in addition 
considerable skill and practise is required to use them at all.
