Lets see.. the times I raced (around 45 years ago) our club used  
around 20 different tyres for different weather, street, racing type  
etc conditions.
Each and any of this tyres was tested in training and specific racing  
situations. Any racer wrote down the experiences with his material  
twice a week.
This was compared to drumtests and rolling behind car tests as well as  
simple rolling down tests.
Yes, in theory the wider, softer tyre is faster. In praxis the theory  
is wrong ;-) To have the same security with a wide tyre you also need  
wider rims, that means more air resistance, turbulences, more weight.  
far less control in curves and emergency braking, more surface to pick  
up things that kills your tyre.
We only used tubulars in racing with 230 to 280 gr. Main reasons  
beside weight was the far better running flat features. Ever had a  
flat with a wide tyre on small rims while downhilling at 80 km/h  
speed? That was at the times the &quot;wider is better&quot; story came up first  
in the early sixties and we had to try it.
With unbelievable luck nothing on my body was broken and 2 weeks after  
I raced again.. Other racers gained more bad experiences in racing  
criterions with wider, softer tyres the idea was dead at this times.
Materials are changing and the wide tyre story came up and goes in the  
very same way as crank lenghts - in specific situations a smaller or  
wider tyre. a shorter or longer crank can be an advantage, but there  
is no generally &quot;its better&quot;
