<PRE>ITEM ONE: SUSPENSION: One of the points of the testing at &quot;Bicycle  
Quarterly&quot; is that suspension is helpful on a bicycle and that the  
suspension which has to move the least amount of material will be the  
most efficient. So that a tire is the most efficient location to  
place suspension. Tire suspension comes from how you manage  
inflation. Suspending the wheel involves losses from moving the whole  
wheel up and down. Suspension of the rider involves losses from  
moving the whole weight of the rider. ...Something like that, anyway.

ITEM TWO: TIRE TESTS: The extensive tire-testing in the report at   
<A HREF="http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/images/AFM_tire_testing_rev8.pdf">http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/images/AFM_tire_testing_rev8.pdf</A>   
focuses on standard race tires for the most part. I see high results  
for a 27mm and 25mm tire but otherwise not much diversity in tire  
dimension. It is, however, amazing to see the variation in watts  
among 20-23mm tires!
