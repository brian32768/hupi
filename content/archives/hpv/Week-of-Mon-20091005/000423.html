</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;Upright riding, racing and R&amp;D&quot; - unscientific?

I'm going by the uprighter's dismissal of recumbents as &quot;dumb&quot;  
without investigation and the huge role of trend/fad in the upright  
scene.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I've got several books on this subject which are very scientific.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some are, some aren't.
</I>&gt;<i> How do you know which books I have?
</I>
I didn't say that I did. &quot;Some books on the subject are, some aren't...&quot;

&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; There were some results in a Swiss book I got a couple of days  
</I>&gt;<i> ago
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; about the measurement of tire rolling resistance. Very detailed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As it relates to real-world or racing conditions? Or steel drum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resistances?
</I>&gt;<i> As it relates to factual measurements in real world conditions and  
</I>&gt;<i> provable results.
</I>
Ah, good.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So what is the rolling resistance of this magic unnamed tire?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't recalling refering to a tire? Do you have a quote?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mentioned the comparison of wider, softer (supple) tires to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard narrow hard ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How can you generalize about a group of tires without knowledge of  
</I>&gt;<i> the specific tires to base that decision on?   How magic are these  
</I>&gt;<i> tires that nobody can name them or the method of testing?
</I>
They can be named and their testing described.

My question stands exactly as I put it.

Apologies to other readers for the waste of time.
