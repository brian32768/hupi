<PRE>Quest-riding Ian (Zzyzx on Bentrider) told me that he replaced the Big Apples with 20mm narrower Stelvios for TT riding, running at the same pressure. His times didn't improve. Bear in mind that he's TT'ing on Eastern Washington industrial strength chipseal pavement.
He said we was skeptical of testing posted on the German velomobile forum, but his experience bore this out.
