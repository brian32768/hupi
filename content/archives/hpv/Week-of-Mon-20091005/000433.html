If the two tires are the same diameter and at the same pressure, then the cord tension in the longitudinal direction will be the same for each; but the fat tire will have greater cord tension in the lateral direction than the skinny tire, because of its larger cross-sectional radius. The only consequences of this difference (I can think of) are that the fat tire will more vulnerable to rim blowoff or sidewall blowout; and the rolling resistance of the fat tire will not be as high as predicted from the hysteresis of its larger mass of flexing rubber. If this increase in hysteresis over the skinny tire is not significant, then the fat tire will have lower rolling resistance, other things being equal -- which they usually are not. 
 
I wish I could point you to more information about this, but I don't recall that it was ever all in one place online. Michelin and Kenda both did extensive tests, but most of the analyses were done by others -- University faculty and students, for example.
