It's a region with a reputation for being led by fads, marketing,  
prejudice, habit...

&gt;<i> I've got several books on this subject which are very scientific.
</I>
Some are, some aren't.

&gt;<i> There were some results in a Swiss book I got a couple of days ago  
</I>&gt;<i> about the measurement of tire rolling resistance.  Very detailed  
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>
As it relates to real-world or racing conditions? Or steel drum  
resistances?

&gt;<i> So what is the rolling resistance of this magic unnamed tire?
</I>
I don't recalling refering to a tire? Do you have a quote?

I mentioned the comparison of wider, softer (supple) tires to  
standard narrow hard ones.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The new Autumn '09 issue of &quot;Bicycle Quarterly&quot; published a watts-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meter test showing that wider, lower pressure tires were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; significantly faster than hard, narrow ones.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have HPV riders found this out as well?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are HPV riders using watts-meters these days?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The mag issue suggested that the upright riding, racing, and R&amp;D
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scenes tend to be unscientific, which is why they haven't made these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tests or discoveries themselves.
