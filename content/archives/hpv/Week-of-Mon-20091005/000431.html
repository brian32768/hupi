I would think that narrow tires at 100psi would ride much the same as  
wide ones at the same pressure. The point of riding wide tires is to  
increase suspension at the most efficient location, so you ride wide  
tires at lower pressure. From another perspective, to get the same  
pinchflat protection of a narrow high pressure tire, a wide tire  
needs much less pressure. However, a caution point when using wide  
tires to reduce rolling resistance is that the tire has to be supple,  
that is, high quality. A stiff, wide tire might generate more  
hysteresis from flexing than it would save in suspension. Thick and/ 
or squirmy tread has these losses as well. Budget tires and tires  
designed for harsh conditions both tend to not roll fast. Very few  
wide tires today are made for getting lower resistance. Of course,  
wide is relative. You have to test tire and pressures on your desired  
road surface at your desire speeds to see what requires the least  
wattage...in light on wind resistance, of course. I would think that  
HPV racers would have good data of this sort.

Are HPV racers using watt-meters these days that anyone here knows of?

Word is, for instance, that UCI track racers are using 25mm tires  
these days because they're faster than 19, 20, 23...

It would be interesting if a company offered a top model in a 28 to  
test such a tire on everyday road surfaces in a faired bike where  
rolling resistance is a more apparent factor, given that wind  
resistance is reduced compared to typical UCI bikes.

I've heard about Michelin's 15% squat figure. I see that their top  
tire (Pro Race 3) has a suggested pressure range of 87-116psi in 23  
and 73-102 in 25. I suppose these figures are wide-ranging so that  
riders of various bodyweights can get the same 15% squat. However,  
I've also seen the science basis of this 15% figure challenged.

I'm mostly interested in the tire testing of faired HPV racers who  
use watt-meters. Word?
