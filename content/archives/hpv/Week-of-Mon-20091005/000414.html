used one as around campus transportation in graduate school.

</I>I would put on inline skating wrist, elbow and knee pads and my bicycle 
foam hat before trying for downhill speed. The Razor scooters are easily 
tripped up by out of alignment sidewalk panel joints, which is one 
reason I upgraded to a Sidewalker Micro with ISO 203-mm pneumatic tires.
&gt;<i> In Switzerland they are legal on sidewalks and on streets with little

Indeed, scrapes and bruises are all that usually occurs in a push 
scooter accident, unless a motor vehicle is involved.
