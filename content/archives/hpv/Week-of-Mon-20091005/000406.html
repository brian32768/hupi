<PRE>I'm been having trouble finding consistent reporting of the percentage 
of children who are now over-weight or obese.

The US Surgeon General's website 
<A HREF="http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/obesityprevention/factsheet/index.html">http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/obesityprevention/factsheet/index.html</A> did 
say that 17 percent of Americans between 2 - 19 years were over-weight. 
However that might have been either an out-dated figure or a simple 
mistake, an inadvertent substitution of &quot;over-weight&quot; for&quot;obese&quot;. The 
New York Times (NYT) citing a Journal of the AMA article, stated the 
percentage of over-weight children was over 32 percent in 2006. 
<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/health/research/28obesity.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/health/research/28obesity.html</A>

The rest of this post references another NYT article, found at the 
following url. 
<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/fashion/13kids.html?scp=6&amp;sq=childhood%20obesity&amp;st=cse">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/fashion/13kids.html?scp=6&amp;sq=childhood%20obesity&amp;st=cse</A>

The situation, of North American kids not being allowed to walk or bike, 
has gotten wacky and is not limited to Sarasota Springs, New York. I 
noticed in the pictures of the street Bill passed on, there were no 
sidewalks. No infrastructure to support bicycling or walking is not 
unusual now days in many parts of the USA.

Some select quotes follow from the NYT article titled, &quot;Why Can't She 
Walk to School?&quot;

.&quot;Last spring, her [ Lori Pierce, Columbus, Miss.] son, 10, announced he 
wanted to walk to soccer practice rather than be driven, a distance of 
about a mile. Several people who saw the boy walking alone called 911. A 
police officer stopped him, drove him the rest of the way and then 
reprimanded Mrs. Pierce. According to local news reports, the officer 
told Mrs. Pierce that if anything untoward had happened to the boy, she 
could have been charged with child endangerment. Many felt the officer 
acted appropriately and that Mrs. Pierce had put her child at risk. 
Critics say fears that children will be abducted by strangers are at a 
level unjustified by reality.

&quot;About 115 children are kidnapped by strangers each year, according to 
federal statistics; 250,000 are injured in auto accidents.&quot;

[...\]

&quot;Schools are skittish about unsupervised young walkers. Lisa Reid, who 
lives in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, had signed a 
permission form, but when her first-grader proudly told his teacher he 
was walking home himself last spring, a distance of six houses, the 
teacher was incredulous. She took him to the office and called Mrs. 
Reid, who didn&#8217;t hear the phone.

&quot;That was because Mrs. Reid was pacing at the end of the driveway, 
waiting for her son, her worries climbing exponentially as the moments 
ticked by.&quot;
