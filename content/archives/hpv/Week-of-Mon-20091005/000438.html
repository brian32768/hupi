<PRE>I think the tem you're trying to find is &quot;unsprung weight&quot;, Jeff. It's an axiom among vehicle designers that reducing unsprung weight improves efficiency, no matter how you measure it. 

I think the design of HPV's are at an interesting crossing point: on one hand, a basic unsprung upright bicycle allows the rider to use the muscles as a temporary suspension, rising off the seat and not allowing bumps to slow the vehicle. Heavier, faster recumbents benefit from suspension because the rider can't rise up off the seat, but suffer a penalty due to weight and complexity.

I'd love to see some real-world testing. Within the Schwalbe line, there's 20&quot; and 700C tires in 28mm (Durano), 40mm (Marathon), and 50mm and 60mm (Big Apple) widths. They're not identical construction, but it's possible they're very similar. With disc brakes, these could be mounted on the same bike on appropriate width rims and swapped very easily. This would give us real data for power consumption on real roads.
