</I>Exactly. This means that the wall thickness of the fat tire must be 
greater or it must be run at lower pressure. Or the other way around: 
very skinny tires can be run at very high pressures in spite of having 
thin walls.

In practice there are other effects. The tire must also have material to 
wear away (&quot;tread&quot;) and a thinner tire must thus have a considerably 
greater thickness than theoretically required, or be very vulnerable and 
short-lived. I suspect that the favorable measurements of thicker tires 
have to do with this, i.e. there must be be an optimal diameter where 
the effect of extra rubber (&quot;tread&quot;) needed is minimised, and it is 
plausible that this will be neither with the thinnest nor with the 
fattest tires.

A further effect is that so far we have been considering tubes. A 
tubular tire is a torus which is indented at the road and deformed in 
two or three dimensions (depending how you look at it) at the contact 
area. If we introduce radial belts as is often done with wider tires, it 
becomes more like a cylinder than a torus, and the deformation of the 
tread is mostly in one or two dimensions. The deformation of the side 
walls is still two or three dimensional, but here the material is 
thinner. I'm not sure what this means except that presumably such 
anisotropic tires can have lower resistance than simple tubes and that 
it is easier to engineer such tires in larger sizes.
