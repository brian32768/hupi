<PRE>The new Autumn '09 issue of &quot;Bicycle Quarterly&quot; published a watts- 
meter test showing that wider, lower pressure tires were  
significantly faster than hard, narrow ones.

Have HPV riders found this out as well?

Are HPV riders using watts-meters these days?

The mag issue suggested that the upright riding, racing, and R&amp;D  
scenes tend to be unscientific, which is why they haven't made these  
tests or discoveries themselves.

I've seen wide tires used on HPVs but they've been pumped to high  
pressure.

I suppose that soft, thin, supple, wide, low pressure tires under a  
heavy HPV rounding an off-camber corner at high speed might give  
interesting results... What kind of pressures do motorcycles use?

A way to do windless watts testing of tires and suspension losses  
might be if you set up big indoor rollers with unevennesses,  
coarsenesses and micro-bumps applied to them to simulate various  
types of asphalt. Heck you could even apply chipseal...

Of course, the wide, low-pressure approach to tires has to be paired  
with high quality and suppleness to reduce hysteresis -- losses due  
to flex.
