Michelin, who know a thing or two about tires, states that optimum 
rolling resistance is achieved when the tire deflects about 15% of 
it's height under load.   The 25mm x 700 Michelin Litheons on one of 
my road bikes state that pressures should be 73psi to 102psi.  BTW A 
welcome new trend I've noticed is tires that some are actually the 
nominal size.

</I>
Stiff frames, overinflated tires and motorcycles that are jetted too 
lean all give the rider sensory input that makes him feel like he's 
going faster than he is.

&gt;<i>I've seen wide tires used on HPVs but they've been pumped to high

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I suppose that soft, thin, supple, wide, low pressure tires under a
</I>&gt;<i>heavy HPV rounding an off-camber corner at high speed might give
</I>&gt;<i>interesting results...
</I>
Unless the rims are too narrow, my experience is that cornering is 
more secure and predictable.

&gt;<i>  What kind of pressures do motorcycles use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>A way to do windless watts testing of tires and suspension losses
</I>&gt;<i>might be if you set up big indoor rollers with unevennesses,
</I>&gt;<i>coarsenesses and micro-bumps applied to them to simulate various

</I>
Good idea, but I think you would have to use a pretty large drum to 
get accurate results.

&gt;<i>Of course, the wide, low-pressure approach to tires has to be paired
</I>&gt;<i>with high quality and suppleness to reduce hysteresis -- losses due
</I>&gt;<i>to flex.
</I>
I have 50mm Schwalbe &quot;Big Apples&quot; on one bike and 50mm CST Cyclops on 
another.  Same Sun Rhyno Lite rims.  Cyclops are 100 grams lighter so 
should roll as well or better at low pressures, but it's not even 
close.  I eventually settled on 35psi in the Apples and 65 in the Cyclops.

I do run high pressures on the Moulton (37-349 Bromptons) but I 
figure suspension should factor in.

You also have to factor in aero drag.  It increases logarithmically 
with increases in speed while rolling resistance is roughly 
linear.  So a wider tire may consume less total power at 15 mph but 
more at 30 mph.  Casual coast-down comparisons seem to confirm this.

Any day I can average 15 mph is a great day so I go for the wide end 
of the spectrum.
