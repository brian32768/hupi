</I>

While there are difficulties in any scheme of public road infrastructure, I found that riding a couple of hundred miles on England's secondary roads was made more tolerable because of the roundabouts that allowed all traffic to merely slow down navigate through them, bikes included. I live in 'the OC' a collection of suburban cites in the broad alluvial plain Of the Los Angeles region wedded to the American grid pattern. Except that each area of development  oriented their grid at different angles to the others, not thinking that they would ever meet at the margins. The equivalent to the roundabout here is the four-way stop, and like the roundabout, no one complete stops any sort of vehicle, but their is a lot less forgiveness in the design. It gets way out of hand when the intersection is as broad as four lanes in each direction, as some in newer areas tend to be.  Undoubtedly they were designed to have traffic lights in future with room for left and right turn pockets. They are built large enough to use a roundabout but at present they serve mainly as intimidation arenas. The few developments that have tried them, however, face criticism for doing things &quot;differently&quot; and causing confusion.

It is the scale of our development that gets me the most.  An alien looking down from space over southern California or many other of our rapidly expanding megalopolises  might rightly conclude that our species has a large body with between four and eighteen wheels instead of legs.
