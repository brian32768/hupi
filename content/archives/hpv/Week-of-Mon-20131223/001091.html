Gee I easily qualify as an old geezer, but I have no problem getting up off 
a seat that is 7 inches off the ground. But then I have a above seat 
handlebar system on my tadpole.

Back 9 years ago I wrote up my trike design philosophy, which started with 
the issues of getting in/out of a shelled vehicle. It all centered around 
the above seat T shaped handlebar system.

To get up off a low seat I grab a brake so the vehicle wont move, grab the 
center of the handlebar and pull myself up, and step out of the vehicle. 
Easily - no struggle.
I also use the same system to lower myself with ease down on the seat.

I also use the handlebar to push and steer the vehicle as I walk along side 
it to move it from one place to another. I do this a lot when shopping and 
running errands and parking the vehicle at home.

I also grab the handlebar for stability as I get in/out of my  vehicle. 
Because I don't need to put any of my weight on the shell it allows the use 
of very light shell materials.

I also grab the handlebar and back of the seat to lift the vehicle. It helps 
that it only weighs 45 pounds (that's trike with shell - shell is around 7 
pounds).

When I have run without the shell my trike out coasts other trikes because 
they have side stick steering (more frontal area - my arms are more in line 
with the airflow).

This handlebar allow smaller lighter canopies.

Yet to my amazement, in all these years essentially no one is using above 
seat handlebars.

I have recently did a write up on details of this system. I call it
T Bar. T for its shape and T because that's the letter of my last name.
