&gt;<i> AFAIK No one has produced a high performance delta so people are

</I>
Paul Sims of Greenspeed built and raced one at a couple of AIPP events
without noticeable success. The trike was fast but not remarkably so,
and it was more complex than perhaps strictly necessary (leaning). But
perhaps Paul just has no idea how to design a fast delta trike, since
(like everyone else) he seems to have failed.

I suggest that those talking about how good a fast delta would be
actually build one and win some events. Battle Mountain, Murray
Bridge, an IHPVA world championship, whatever you like. But right now
all the trike races I've seem are dominated by tadpoles (in the &quot;OMG,
look, a delta!&quot; sense) and the fastest trike at Battle Mountain has
been a tadpole for some time now. The trike 6, 12 and 24 hour speed
records are also held by tadpoles.
