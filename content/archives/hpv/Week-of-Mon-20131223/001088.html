<PRE>Why I Don't Ride a Trike.

You makers and partakers of trikes have this argument about once every decade. Delta v Tadpole, utility v  road handling. No one seems to be able to address both issues at once, or wants to , it would seem. 
A very long time ago, I proposed to a trike builder that the solution might be to make a Tadpole which would arch upward shortening its wheelbase as it came to a stop. This would entail some serious engineering to put the stop limits and locking mechanisms at the right height for safe operation but could make such a machine both efficient and user friendly.  It would partly solve the vision problem of low trikes at intersections. The differential release of the front and rear brakes could then be used to enable the stored energy of the rider's height to push off once again, saving a gear shift or two. 
I suppose if this old geezer wants to see such a thing before final check-out I had better get busy designing it.
