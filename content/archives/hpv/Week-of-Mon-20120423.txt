I just watched this video of Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Car:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlLZE23EJKs
I was surprised that the vehicle seems to handle just fine with 
rear-wheel steering--something generally considered unworkable. Does 
anyone know the secret of how this works? An overview of the vehicle is at

Yes, they crashed but had good PR.

My recollection is that after one car overturned, they only allowed 
professional race car drivers to drive them (I think on the basis that 
they had good reflexes and were used to driving all sorts of wild things).

Some of what Bucky did was amazing, some of it was smoke and mirrors.

He would have been a great HPV'er, he was perfectly willing to try 
things that we all just know don't work, like rear wheel steering. Too 
bad it does not really work...

Seems to me the FlevoBike was kind of like that. Someone will probably 
pipe up now and say the FlevoBike was the best thing ever invented.

One thing I learned hanging out in the HPV world is that human beings 
can ride damn near anything with 1 or more wheels on it, and often even 
have fun with it.

This is a good read: http://dymaxioncar.com/restoration.html

As a FWD/FWS it would have been great.  But just like every efficient,
aerodynamic design, from the 1920's until today, it would have lost out to
big, uninspired boxes, run on cheap fuel.  Unfortunately, the price at the
pump will never reflect the true costs of gas....until the ice caps are a
memory.

We had a?phenomenal wipe-out at the Fl HPV race a few years?back. Somebody not involved with the usual HPV bunch had designed a streamliner with front wheel drive and two back steer wheels. While flying high on the turn at the velodrome the?steering?gave way and the thing spun round and almost over the top. The driver/rider was not hurt but his ride was out of commission.

The thing is, it took some knowledge of its dynamics to make such a different car practical back then. In this age it would only need some computer aided control like the sort that now makes model helicopters flyable for a wide variety of people when not so long ago it was far too difficult. 

Eric Edwards streamliner Pegasus is rear steering and I managed to get it around the San Diego Velodrome once a long time ago even though it was designed only for straight line speed.  What made it work ( just barely) was the friction he included to control its tendency to oscillate with a positive feedback. It also was set up to have the steering axis line reach the ground forward of the contact patch as most steering needs. It did have trail, but only within a narrow range of its motion, so that I had it at full lock most of the way around the oval and entered the corners as wide as possible. Bucky's machine couldn't have had such strictures and do what he promised it could do. Today we would just build it with all-wheel steering and stability controls like modern cars.  

The rear engine idea did not die with the Dymaxion as anyone who owned a VW or a Corvair can attest. I owned both at one time. I took my VW up to Big Bear lake in winter once and experienced what even that variation can do to a car's handling when I hit glare ice, did a complete 360 degrees at speed and kept on going to the ski slopes thanking my lucky stars.

I'm not convinced. The big issue for rear steering only on roads
is curbs. To move away from a curb the rear steer has to move the
rear end towards the curb. Which kind of works with the Dymaxion
because it's wider at the front than the rear. But for a rectangular
vehicle that's not possible. So you have to reverse away from the
curb. Which is bearable for parking, but easily fatal when you
drift too close to a motorway barrier.

Remember, on the road it's all about failure modes. Just working
is not enough, it has to fail gracefully.

This is the bit that computer control can fix. Some fighter planes
IIRC are so grossly unstable that humans can't operate them without
computer control. Which is great for maneuverability, but not so hot
if the computer fails.

Engine behind the axle is still used by Porsche. Many race and performance cars have the engine ahead of the rear wheels, as the Dymaxion did. The unusual thing about the drive train was that the rear engine drove the front wheels.

All of the issues with rear wheel steering mentioned so far are part of the
problem, but not the major problem. The major problem with rear wheel
steering is that it is dynamically unstable. As pointed out, modern computer
controls can overcome this, but it doesn't change the basic instability of
the mechanical system.

It's a common misconception. In 1997 the rear-wheel steering Thrust SSC (driven by RAF Wing Commander Andy Green) held its line flawlessly as it went faster than sound at Black Rock, about 380 miles north-northwest of where I am sitting now.

I hear that vehicle was quite interesting to drive. And "held it's line"
meant "kept within a 100 metre wide strip". Admittedly, at 300m/s that's
fairly impressive. I read a book on the effort and there was some odd
combination of half second witlag in the steering and not a lot of
steering movement that meant it took a while for the pilot to get the hand
of controlling it at all.


Mind you, Christiana sell a lot of pivot-steer trikes that have most
of the same issues of dynamic instability and few people complain.

RWS works fine if its done properly.  Back in the early 80s a chap named 
Simon Sanderson built a thing named "Panzer" (the least-appropriately named 
thing ever to hit the roads of BRITAIN until the introduction of the 
Mitsubishi Carisma), which was FWD, RWS and perfectly roadable.  Simon was 
working in London and weekend commuting back to Norfolk at the time, IIRC, 
and could do the trip at better than 20 mph average speed.

In 2002 I rode a RWS Stormy Weather velomobile at the HPVA World
Championship in Canada.
  I rode in several events and for the most part the RWS part of the vehicle 
was ignored.
As it was fully faired I rode with the streamliners I have the memory of 
being lapped several
times by the Varna, Barracuda, and Keno;s liner.
   I constructed the steering so the trail could be adjusted. I started with 
2 inches of positive trail
and over time adjusted to less and less to settle down the stability and 
feel.
 The closer to 0 trail the feel improved. Between 1/2 inch and 3/4 inc of 
negative trail
was the optimal setting for the experiment.
   RWS works fine if properly executed and allowed for a simple low friction 
FWD.
