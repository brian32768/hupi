Subject: [hpv] XPORT Flatbed/Sportrack EZ4 hitch rack?
Message-ID: <20090622171031.673121405BABB@cedar.isis.unc.edu>


Could anyone give their opinion on the XPORT/Sportrack EZ4 hitch rack?
Why I ask:

I'm still looking for a rack to carry my Lightning Stealth SWB and one
or two uprights (but at least I've gotten to 2 candidates :-) I
definitely want

* a hitch rack (we already have a 2" receiver)

* a tray-type rack (that holds the wheels) rather than a top-tube rack

The Draftmasters seem to be really well-{designed, made, reviewed},
and I see an HR-3 for $440. However I live near a Performance shop,
and they have an XPORT Flatbed 4-bike rack

http://www.performancebike.com/bikes/Product_10052_10551_1031411_-1_30001_20000_30500

(which appears to be the same as the Sportrack 4EZ

http://www.sportrack.com/a30902

) for $300. Since I

* am definitely price-sensitive

* kinda like Performance (even if Garry Snook is a Republican): I've
  been using Performance gear for years (they started in Chapel Hill),
  mostly successfully, including occasional returns

I'm wondering, have any listers used either the Sportrack 4EZ or the
XPORT Flatbed 4? Your reviews (or pointers to reviews done by others)
are appreciated. Feel free to reply to the list or to me directly.

TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>
