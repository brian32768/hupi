Thanks for the super link, John! At least the vehicle from Flensburg probably 
has a pretty sub-optimal turbine (too many blades). Actually the state of the 
art for land vehicles - at least models - is that it is possible to go downwind 
faster than the wind by using the rotary airfoil as a propeller, not turbine. On 
the mailing list of the AYRS (Amateur Yacht Research Society) this subject comes 
up every few years. So far nobody knows whether it could be achieved with boats. 
We think so, but nobody has yet built one. The opposite case - the headwind 
vehicle - is however easily done for both land vehicles and boats.
