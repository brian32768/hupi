Hi John,
Yes, you can of course use the same foil for both purposes, but if it is an 
asymetrical foil, as is usual, one of the applications will be the &quot;wrong way&quot; 
around, as for example with an airplane flying upside down. You must either 
design the foil to be primarly for the one or the other purpose - and accept 
poor performance in the &quot;wrong&quot; mode, or use a symetrical foil section. In this 
case the achievable coefficient of lift is rather limited, i.e. you need more 
surface.

</I>
The Amick wind car also used an electrical system even though the foil was a 
fixed wing like a sail, but unlike this even fixed in attitude. The idea was to 
sail in favorable winds charging the batteries and using the stored energy for 
propulsion in unfavorable winds. The Kiel University car is more universal as 
every wind is favorable. You don't need energy storage except for the case of no 
wind. The disadvantage is the safety issue of rotary foils on a street vehicle; 
I'm sure a road licence wouldn't be granted in most countries.

Cheers, Theo
