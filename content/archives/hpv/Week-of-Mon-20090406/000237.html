Theo,

The faster than tailwind concept is super cool!

Is it plausible to use a single rotary airfoil for both a propeller or a 
turbine? IOW, the operator would be able to use the same rotor as either 
a power input or a power output device.

Notice that Kiel University's vehicle employs an electric drive train. 
That neat arrangement suggests possible design opportunities for 
assisted HPVs which used natural energy sources exclusively .
