...and what did the cyclists do/respond? Or should I not dare ask?...:-(

A well-written article, I'd say. Ideally, of course, we should all
obey the law absolutely (wives in labour notwithstanding, I guess!),
and when this means we have to do something stupidly awkward, the
combined frustration of all those people inconvenienced by said law
would be enough to get it changed. I say "ideally"....what I'm not
clear on is to what extent mass disobeyance of a law provides any
political force to change it? There was one example locally, in which
a short section of one-way street along which many many cyclists rode
the one way was then changed to allow bikes to go both ways along it,
but - if people simply ignore a law, doesn't seem they're putting much
effort into getting it changed...

There are multiple sides on this situation. Bicyclists who break man 
made laws regarding stop signs are sometimes doing so in order to comply 
with Nature's legal system.

All bicycles when in motion store up Kinetic Energy (KE). That energy 
comes from human muscle and effort. Coming to a stop bleeds that 
personal savings investment off, like a robber's tax levied in Joules 
instead of dollars. Hitting the brakes changes human-derived power into 
waste heat. An additional component of that energy tax  is tacked on 
when restarting from a stand still, when the energy losses from braking 
must be made up for with an momentary energy spike. This is Newton all 
gussied up and dropped into the real world... "an object in motion stays 
in motion until acted upon by an outside force."  Automobile drivers pay 
the same acceleration "tax", but do so by purchasing additional fuel.

In an urban  environment,  which may impose frequent stops and starts, a 
cyclist  loses average speed as well as experiences a reduction in the 
maximal distance he or she is able to travel in a day's time.  In such a 
setting the force due to acceleration can represent the most significant 
form of parasitic drag encountered. Loses due to linear and rotational 
acceleration can be of a greater magnitude  than energy loss from 
rolling resistance, the force due to gravity on a slope, or even air drag.

The core problem is not cyclists or motorists, both of which are just us 
humans, rather it is a matter of older road design that in some cases 
needs to catch up to modern needs.

Here is another take on the situation presented in a recent VeloNews 
article:

Here's the link to an excellent article (PDF) written by Joel Fajans, 
"Why Cyclists Hate Stop Signs" published in 2001 in Access magazine.

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fajans/pub/pdffiles/StopSignsAccess.pdf

Dr. Fajans, a faculty member of the Physics department of University of 
California at Berkeley (UCB) wrote, and we quote;

"I've also spend some time exploring the effects of stop signs on 
bicycle commuters.  Maintaining the same speed on a road with stop signs 
as one attains on a road without stop signs is very demanding.  For 
example, on a road with stop signs every 300ft (100m), 500watts of power 
will result in the same speed as 100 watts would get on a road without 
stop signs.  Since 500watts is far higher than all but racing cyclists 
can produce, bicyclists on road with stops signs must slow dramatically. 
  These calculations were verified with road tests on California St. in 
Berkeley, a designated bike route with many stop signs."

Exactly.  So motorists coasting through stop signs are conserving
fuel.  That's a good thing, right?

This isn't really about human power vs. motor power.  Nobody likes
stopping for stop signs, no matter what they're driving.

Some possible alternatives:

* Replace some stop signs with yield signs and/or roundabouts.

* Allow the same leeway for stopping that we allow for speed limits.
If 30 MPH in a 25 zone is allowed, then 5 MPH through a stop sign
(when there's no cross traffic) should also be allowed.

What sort of sadistic design is that?  That's 17 stop signs per mile
or 10 per kilometer.

Just for curiosity's sake  I  used Google Earth's measurement tool. 
There are in fact residential areas in Berkeley California that do have 
road intersections every 300 feet (100 m), sometimes less.

Sure, but putting a stop sign at every intersection is ridiculous.  I
know they're trying to slow (motor) traffic, discourage cut-through
(motor) traffic, etc.  Surely there's a better way than using that
many stop signs.

There are better ways, but none more cost-effective. Installing a stop
sign costs around $300 if the sign is just added to an existing pole,
or $1000 (roughly) if a new pole has to be used. All other forms of
traffic calming require much more investment in time and money just to
plan out, not to mention the capital costs of installation. I read
that the traffic calming required to create a mile of bike boulevard
in Portland was in excess of a million dollars when all the planning,
environmental studies, and actual capital improvements on the ground
were totaled together. Just the actual road furniture alone ran about
half that. Now do the math $1,000,000 vs. $16,000 ?

Cheaper, sure.  But yield signs and stop signs cost about the same.

Effective?  If you have so many stop signs that nobody actually stops,
is that actually effective?

It might even be counter-effective if people get used to treating
traffic controls as suggestions rather than requirements.

Boo F-ing Hoo.

Really.  I'm sure the car drivers (with the possible exception of  
hybrid and electric vehicles with regen braking) don't appreciate  
using more gas.

Consider it effective interval training.  I, for one, am sick of the  
boi-racer mentality that can't be bothered to play by the rules of the  
road.  Yes, car drivers violate the rules too ... but "they do it  
too" (with the appropriate pouty facial expression) is no excuse.

Every cyclists who blatantly runs red lights and doesn't even make an  
attempt to slow and look, at a stop sign endangers me by creating a  
negative impression of all cyclists.  Treat it as a 'yield' if you  
must, but at least make an attempt at following the rules here.

(Yes, if the light doesn't sense the bike ... you can proceed when  
safe to do so, and so on and so on....)

SAME ROADS, SAME RULES, SAME RIGHTS.

The difference is between stopping  a 200 pound (all up) vehicle
moving 9 mph with no visual or auditory impairment vs. stopping a 3000
pound vehicle moving 12 mph with blind spots and deaf, so while the
goal is laudable the lack of safety escalates. Therein, the problem.
How to draw a line in the law including "A" but excluding "B." Given
that laws here are the result of political process, you are as likely
to get your law including "B" twice and banning "A" at risk of
incarceration.

YMMV, of course. Elrey in Orange County, California

If I could use the same roads and had the same rights I'd be more
willing to follow the same rules. Since I don't, that's just

La Costa Avenue, San Diego County.  A "bike lane" that's so narrow  
that's it's a joke.

I got hit by a Suburban two years ago on it, speed limit is 55mph, I  
was going around 21mph (tailwind).  Tailbox took the hit and was ...  
incredibly ... able to ride home, bloodied.

They never stopped.

Still, I'm still calling a "spoiled brat" a brat.

If I was in your situation (and now I do this on La Costa) I'd take  
the lane.

Crazy.

Take as an example a 100 kg rider and bike, typical garden-variety 
upright; CdA= 0.4 m^2, Crr=0.0050, drive train efficiency = 95%  then 
head down a flat road at 5.5 m/s (12.7 mph) on one of those rare 
windless days.

The distribution of drag components might follow this pattern; rolling 
drag 28 watts (36%), Aerodynamic drag 45 watts (59%), Efficiency loss 4 
watts (5%), total 77 watts (100%).

As a contrast, add in a complete stop every 100 meters, thus an 
acceleration from 0.0 m/s to 5.5 m/s in that distance. At the maximum 
speed (5.5 m/s) , just prior to stopping, the drag distribution 
transform into; rolling drag 28 watts (16%), Aerodynamic drag 45 watts 
(26%), Efficiency loss 9 watts (5%) Linear Inertia 93 watts (52%) 
Rotational Inertia (2 watts) 1 %, total 177 watts (100%). By having 
imagined a constant acceleration the rider's average speed will be less 
than 2.75 m/s (6.2 mph).

This was a crude model, but it serves to point toward how significant 
stopping can be for any cyclist.

The mythical average human can sustain a 75 watt power output for 8 
hours. The same person would be able to sustain 175 watts for 2 hours. 
That's a big difference for a utility cyclist..

Not too long ago, I was in a commuting situation where I was riding more 
than 30 miles a day, five or more times a week. Occasionally, though 
rarely the distance stretched to 50 miles a day within the town limits.  
I didn't ignore the stop sign laws (to my best recollection, Judge), 
just tried to find "creative" routes through town where the number of 
complete stops was minimized.

Fifty miles on the Interstate is a piece of cake compared to riding 50 
miles stop-and-go. No matter how far down the road I am, it takes just a 
handful of  800 watt power spikes as a result of accelerations to make 
getting back home an overly difficult challenge.
 
It's just a fact of life, not a complaint.

Eh, I know the attitude you are referring to. It's something way beyond 
being an energy miser.

A couple of years ago, here, a cyclist all decked out with with all the 
shiny ToF toys and logo-ed Lycra clothing, came down a long hill in town 
as fast as he could, exceeding the posted speed limits, passing 
everything else on the road. He completely ignored the stop sign at the 
base of the hill, then turned wide into the path of an on-coming car 
driver who was making a legal turn. The combined impact speed was 
possibly in excess of 60 mph. The cyclist 's body did enough damage to 
the car to almost total it for insurance purposes. The road bike frame 
and wheels were twisted into weird shapes.  The biker went partially 
though the car's windshield on the passenger side, caving in the car's 
roof and hood in the process.  By pure miracle the cyclist survived and 
the car driver wasn't hurt too much, mostly just shook up, covered with 
glass crumbs and blood spatter. It was just a plain stupid move, on that 
cyclist's part which endangered the life of not only himself but of 
others as well.

If we want the special consideration by any level of government (local,
state, etc.) that would be required for reform and/or funding for specific
bike routes, we have to start by obeying the laws that are in place. Yes,
it's difficult to bike when there is a stop sign every few hundred feet.
Yes, the rules are different between us and cars, many times in favor of
cars. Yes, we burn a lot more energy and distance-riding-capacity every time
we have to accelerate, and yes, there are situations where you will have to
fend for yourself - the solution, though, starts by showing the difficulties
of obeying the status quo to your lawmakers, and constantly urging them for
change until you get what you want.

The fact that bicycles are mainly designed to win bicycle races but are 
then used on public roads lends to this problem.  A typical diamond 
frame bike, when "properly" adjusted, doesn't allow the rider to easily 
stop since their feet cannot reach the ground.  Motorcycles are not 
limited by this problem, nor are many recumbents.  I suppose we are a 
big choir of 'bent believers, so there is little gained by my pointing 
this out here, but a bike so configured as to let the operator easily 
place a foot on the ground for easy stops and at the same time have one 
foot on a pedal and the lower back against the seat for a fast start 
makes safe driving easier.  There isn't any way of winning a competition 
with this ability, but it contributes to cooperative driving.

I don't know about other HPV drivers, but to me the ability to 
constantly monitor the activity of traffic behind in my lane seems to be 
the key to both confidently using "full lane mode" and doing it safely 
and cooperatively.  This essentially means the ability to use a mirror 
(like all other drivers do).  As a result of design, some HPVs allow for 
a handlebar position that facilitates handlebar mirror use.

There may be alternatives to mirrors for this, but none that I know of. 
    While I would not suggest that a mirror can replace a head check for 
instances like turns and lane changes, the mirror works best for /all/ 
the moments in between.  The majority of cyclists, even the skilled 
ones, don't have a sense of their ability and need to manage the flow of 
traffic in their lane, mainly because they cannot reliably observe it.

Cycling safety educators have done a good job of using crash statistics 
to prioritize what cyclists need to learn to do safely, and I consider 
it reasonable to keep novices focused on the problems of intersection 
collisions over the more anxiety-ridden matter of the danger from 
overtaking cars.  This teaching encourages cyclists to use full lane 
mode more often to improve their visibility to opposing and intersecting 
traffic, but it is still muddy about interactions with pursuing traffic. 
This is understandable, since the majority of bikes are not 
well-designed for the use of handlebar mirrors.  Helmet mirrors are 
usable, and I've discussed their use with people who are capable of 
getting enough steady information from them, but this takes technique 
and practice.  I've beat the drum for helmet mirror training as a part 
of the LAB Traffic Safety 101 curriculum, but I'll agree with the 
authorities that there is only so much that can be packed into a basic 
class.

Still, my anecdotal observation is that when trained cyclist get hit in 
traffic it is from behind.  This makes sense, since they have learned 
how to better control the other dangers.  Collisions from behind may be 
less of a problem than from the front, but they still happen.

But if we are to offer up the best possible "urban safety cycle," it 
wouldn't necessarily have a personal injury lawyer in a trailer, but it 
would facilitate easy stops, fast starts, and the ability to monitor the 
traffic behind.

Excellent points, well made, I say :-).

ISTR that there is *are* alternatives classes/races at some HPV events
which encourage non-"racing" bikes: yes, fastest time to get round a
course, but the "course" includes tests of manoeuverability,
loading/unloading shopping, parking, etc. Perhaps this kind of thing
needs to be more common, and/or be expanded to include more
starts/stops (without dismounting), mirror use, etc.? (not sure how to
do the last both competitively and fairly...but maybe brighter minds
can come up with something? :)).

My favorite is the right-turn, U-turn, right-turn when no close traffic is
around. It's legal! Rarely are "No U-turn" signs around  an intersection, I
turned right, made the U, then turned right so didn't run the traffic light.

Car drivers seem to understand this move as well.

Bottom line is I'm not waiting at a light with no traffic coming, can't lose
that precious time to your average speed on a commute.

For static stop signs, to me if your wheels stop that's enough for a human
powered vehicle, no feet down. Having to put a foot down is a
non-human-power view of the situation of authorities trying to make it hard
for cyclists to blow through a stop with the intimidation of the fine. 

Those cyclists will blow through anyway, that's human nature so live with it
and stop being the Gestapo and ticketing people for not putting a foot down
yet having slowed way down (and I'm saying locking the wheels is kinda' OK
since it's about the same speed as most cyclists use as a "stop"). These are
people trying to get along but don't want to lose their momentum, it's
meaningful to hpv's and means nothing to drivers.

So, as people point out, if you lose all your momentum as a cyclist, to get
it back is a total loss to that person's limited energy supply.

Well, now and into the future as we watch the planet heat up, it's time for
human power to have the priority and putting a foot down is that one
regulatory step too far at human power speeds that rarely exceed 25-mph
unless it's down a hill.

Time for a break, if I slow way down or lock up my brakes my body isn't
going very fast, but to take away that last bit of kinetic energy has no
return, it's lost and must be made up by my body, and since I'm not burning
fossil fuel, eating must give me the energy to do it and that has a limit. 

Until cars eat to get where they are going and don't pollute the planet, I
refuse to put a foot down unless I see the cop, but am polite to any traffic
that sometimes may show up near enough to be respected.

Here in Scottsdale, AZ, they're thinking of forcing riders to put BOTH feet
down or you get a ticket, sounds like another money-making deal to me that
has nothing to do with public safety and made from the "cars are king of the
road" point of view that disses you and me, we ride "toys" to them. 

They're not used to having the same roadie waiting at the lights for their
trip to the store, they don't realize how much time they waste at lights,
you see them react. And, the latest sleeze look by these folks is that
anyone on a bike is out of a job or homeless, and I ride lycra all the time
.. sick.

While we are campaigning for removal of stop signs, could we also get

Or even convert all the uphills to downhills (in both directions) ?

Same here with my cargo trike.  At a little over 4 feet in width I  
have no choice but to take the lane, and with its turn signals and  
running lights I get far more respect.  In five years of riding it  
(and I ride quite a bit) I get maybe one angry honk per year.  I  
sometimes ride it when just my bike and trailer would do because of  
this (though the drawback is not being able to get around other  
vehicles during traffic stoppages).

We mostly do, depending on the laws.

The default is that every driver gets the same amount of space: one
lane.  Even a slow vehicle driver gets the entire outside lane.
However, sometimes cyclists get less than that.

In some states, cyclists are only allowed to use the outside edge of
the outside lane, with some exceptions (see below).

In some states, cyclists are required to use a bike lane, which is
typically less than half the width of an ordinary lane.  There are
some exceptions (see below).

Usually, if the outside lane is narrow, cyclists are allowed to use
the full outside lane, same as any other driver.

Other typical full lane situations include traveling at the prevailing
speed, approaching intersections and driveways, passing, or preparing
to turn left.

Ultimately, the discriminatory far-to-the-right and
mandatory-bike-lane laws need to be repealed so that cyclists will
have the same lane rights as all other drivers.

But the situations where we don't have full lane rights are fairly
specialized.  Typically, all the following must be true:

* Cyclist is slower than prevailing traffic
* Outside lane is wide enough to share with passing traffic
* There are no intersections or driveways

Mike Librik- Well said, all of it.

And thanks for making me think about novices and mirrors. I realized this is 
an oversight on my part in my daughter's training. She mostly rides on the 
trail a bike to/from school, but I think it's not too early to learn how to 
use a mirrror. She is getting good at catching intersection dangers from the 
front; time to get practice monitoring behind.

Thanks!

Just to reinforce an earlier point: If I'm going 15mph on a 45mph road
in a car, I can be cited for "slowpoke" driving. I would not like the
same to be applied to me on a bicycle.

In other words: HPVs and cars are different vehicles, so "sameness" is
imho not a practical goal. But equitable rules that ensure access and
safety, sure.

Not if you're in the right hand lane, following the slow vehicle rule.
 Or turning out when five vehicles stack up behind you on a two-lane
road (in states that have that rule).

Nor if you're operating a vehicle at the speed it is capable of, like
a bike or horse-drawn wagon.  Or a truck climbing a hill.

That was one of the issues in the Selz case.

Right, that's what "same rights, same rules" means.  The phrase
doesn't include "same capabilities".

As a rider of the vehicular cycling type for the past year or so, I've 
begun to recognize that we do have our place in the road.  Timothy 
Cyders has his head in the right place when he suggests that we must 
obey the laws in place for use of these roads.  It doesn't matter that 
motorists think we don't belong on the road, but it does matter when 
people on bikes display lack of regard for established traffic control 
devices.

I ride in the center of the lane at all times, because in my area of the 
state of Florida, none of the road lanes are 14 feet wide. I feel lucky 
that Florida has in the statutes a specific reference to a sub-standard 
width lane, which is followed up by a reference in the FL DOT handbook 
stating that fourteen feet is the minimum width in which a bicycle and 
motor vehicle can safely occupy side-by-side. (FL Statute 316.2065 
(5)(a)(3) and FDOT Green Book p.211)

Due to ignorant law enforcement officers, and a couple stupid ones as 
well, I'll be fighting two citations in court, and hope to establish a 
precedent which other cyclists in this state can use.  Some states 
aren't quite so accomodating and my sympathy goes out to cyclists in 
those areas of the country.

2009 Florida Bike Summit
Thursday, April 2, 2009
Florida Capitol Courtyard, Tallahassee FL
10:00-11:30 am

I'll be there, to add my two cents about educating the public and law 
enforcement to get this situation improved.  I've had people tell me 
they take the lane when cars start to pass them dangerously close. Why 
wait? It's the one you don't see that takes you out, not the one that 
gets too close. Florida has the inane three-foot-clearance passing law, 
which is a poor excuse for educating the motorists and the people on 
bikes.  I don't need that three-foot passing law to protect me, since 
I'm in the lane and people change lanes to pass.

I'll soon be an LCI, having completed the LAB Rolling Road One course, 
now called Traffic Skills 101. There are many experienced cyclists, but 
fewer trained and skilled ones. My recommendation is to find an LCI 
(League Cycling Instructor) and sign up for TS101. If you're lacking in 
your area, travel a bit and then become an LCI and benefit the community 
even more.

I used to gripe, now I'm doing something about it.

SRSRSR might be what you want, but I don't. Motor vehicles deservedly
are fenced around with restrictions and limitations, and I do not
think those should be forced onto human powered vehicles. Why argue
for limits you don't need?

At the same time, there are restrictions on hpvs that make a lot of
sense. We're not allowed on some roads, we are allowed into some
"pedestrian-only" areas. We can't park in metered parking areas but we
get to park on the footpath (and many other places).

I don't see motorcyclists or truck drivers campaigning to be treated
the same as car drivers. Could it be that they don't think all road
users should be treated the same?

Countries where cycling works well and is popular don't even pretend
that cyclists should be treated the same as motorised morons.

What's the advantage of the same rules idea? Psychological
legitimacy? Acceptance at the Chruch of Forester?

The 'Clark Chicken Century' that used to be held at Mile Square Park, 
Fountain Valley, California had a traffic light every half-mile.

Fortunately, every second light permitted a right turn on red, which 
reduced the frustration a little.

As you can probably determine from the name of the location, a century 
was 25 laps of the park.

Chris;
    Your request for hill leveling and downhills sounds like my wife's  
definition of when she will ride with me.  Only if the route is  
downhill all the way roundtrip, 70 degrees and sunny, with a 15 mph  
tailwind!

One of the pleasures I found riding in Chris's native country England was the 
roundabout in place of our ubiquitous 4-way stop signs her in California. 
conservation of momentum for most all vehicles unless traffic was heavy. Though a 
few roundabouts are being tried here they have yet to be widespread enough to 
be understood by the average driver, and only rarely are they put into 
practice as replacements for troublesome intersections, where condemnation of 
adjacent property is necessary to their proper installation.
   On my ride in ride in England I would have appreciated some of the 
bi-directional downhills Chris wished for though I brought along my California 
sunshine that week so I didn't have that aspect of English bicycling to deal with.

Message-ID: <c41.54c1273c.36ec49b9@aol.com>

When I look at the morbidity and mortality of driving and road rage I don't 
see signs of great civility.
 
Motorist kill directly and indirectly.  I don't expect to have equal 
treatment under the law but rather expect special treatment for cyclists.  The law 
actually does give us some special handling, though enforcement and 
interpretation is usually applied by motorist.  You go to court not with a judge or jury of 
bicyclists.
 
Most motorist complain about bicycles.  Bicycles annoy them. (Cyclist don't 
stop at stop signs but a Florida DOT stop sign compliance study...Motorist 
compliance is only 35%) Motorists provide most of the energy which kills cyclist, 
pollute the air and water and use a third of some cities land...and I should 
be ok with their choice.  Motorist don't annoy bicyclists, they kill and mame  
them.  Maybe we should be more annoyed as cyclists?
 
Right of way establishes space for the movement of people goods and services. 
 A pedestrian has the right, the motorist and cyclist have the privilege.  A 
cylist is a lot closer to "people" than a motorist...nearly a ton closer..

....Here in New Jersey the roundabouts are being torn out and replaced with a big intersection. The one in my town was replaced about 4 years ago. 
The reason  - too many fender benders. 

I miss the roundabout specially late at night with little traffic you hardly ever have to stop. 

I had a bit of trouble biking thru roundabouts in England, only because I automatically would look in the wrong direction for on coming traffic. I got honked at a few times.

I like that name, "Mile Square Park". Does that mean a turn, every mile 
around the park's perimeter?

Here in my home town the original downtown business district sports a 
four-way stop light every 400 feet (122 meters). The community was 
platted out in the late 19th Century, with foot traffic, horses, bikes 
and electric trolleys in minds of the founders. Hence, the blocks are on 
the small side, and the grades are gentle in most of the original 
neighborhoods.  It's similar to other small towns of the same age in the 
United States.

City law still bans bicycles from being ridden on the sidewalks in the 
downtown area.  It's an old law and a  good law, as it protects us when 
we travel as pedestrians.  A bicyclist is allowed to pedal the "main 
drag".  But, automobile parking on both sides of the street  eliminates 
the possibility of bicycle ridding next to the curb during the day lit 
hours.  In this itty-bitty berg, "same rules, same rights, same road", 
exist in the here and now as they have since the beginning. The 
resulting average traffic speed is modest. 
It's the repeated accelerations and decelerations that make bicycling 
impractical  for only a few blocks at a time. I can pull off a few  of 
those 800 watt power spikes needed to stay up with the horseless 
carriage traffic flow, but not too many and not too often.
