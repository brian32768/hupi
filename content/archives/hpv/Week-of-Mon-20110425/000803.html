<PRE>Sorry Tony, but my $400 iphone mounted on the nose of my fairing?  Not happening!  And I couldn't see the screen well enough anyway.

Or you could put a fisheye lens like the fotojojo ones on a smartphone.  Not that I have any direct experience with that product (yet), I've only just heard about it on the NY Times TechTimes podcast.

Also a trip-recording app like Dailyroads Voyager might give you valuable evidence in case of an accident (you or someone else).  But I can't wholeheartedly endorse this particular one yet- I've only just installed it and don't plan to use it much until I have a good mount for my smartphone.

But Dailyroads Voyager does display at the same time it records, and it records either stills or video clips, and it retains them on demand or on detection of a certain amount of G-force, and I would think a mounting for a smartphone at the head of your vehicle might do what you need with less weight and mounting complexity.  If battery life is not an issue (I charge my phone at both ends of my trips so it's not for me)

&gt;<i> On the Burke-Gilman bike trail in Seattle, which I commute &#160;like an auto-Sisyphus on my Challenge Hurricane, I have several intersections at which the combination of parked cars and my chosen position for my sensory apparatus leads to uncertainty and danger. &#160;So, my idle mind (10 miles each way) has drifted toward a possibly silly solution: &#160;a fisheye camera mounted on the front of my fairing with a screen on my USS bars. &#160;Like a switch-back mirror, if I see movement I would be made aware of a conflict and can take measures.
