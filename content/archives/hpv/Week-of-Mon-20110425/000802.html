<PRE>On the Burke-Gilman bike trail in Seattle, which I commute  like an auto-Sisyphus on my Challenge Hurricane, I have several intersections at which the combination of parked cars and my chosen position for my sensory apparatus leads to uncertainty and danger.  So, my idle mind (10 miles each way) has drifted toward a possibly silly solution:  a fisheye camera mounted on the front of my fairing with a screen on my USS bars.  Like a switch-back mirror, if I see movement I would be made aware of a conflict and can take measures.  

Well, backup camera kits are about $50-150+, so maybe I'll give it a try, just for curiosity's sake.  These car systems are heavy, bulky and 12 v, so far from ideal for a bike, but no reason other than market size to prevent miniature systems compatible with bike dynamos.

I test rode a trike at 'Bent Up in his mostly quiet N. Hollywood neighborhood.  I couldn't even enter the road from his back alley  
without feeling completely blind trying to see around parked cars.   I  
know any lowish recumbent is going to have this issue to some extent, but it just felt like much more of an issue than on my bike with maybe a 23&quot; high seat.

That said, I think a trike would work on most of the loops I ride in San Francisco. They are mostly parks and roads with bike lanes.
