That was British madman and flapjack fairy Drew Buck in 2007, wearing a 
beret and stripy jumper and with the bike decorated with strings of (fake) 
on!ons and garlic.  He has previously done PBP on fixed, on a vintage 
Dursley-Pedersen and on a triplet.  We are awaiting with interest his choice 
of steed for this year's event; there was an ancient French racing bike of 
the type which would have been used on the first PBP in 1891, complete with 
1 inch pitch chain, lurking in his garage when we stopped chez Buck for 
flapjack on the 2007 Cheddar Gorge 300.  Iy needed a fair bit of work, but I 
wouldn't be at all surprised...

Subject: [hpv] 20/26 x 1.35 tires
Message-ID: <0LOC00JSWRPUTT60@mta2.srv.hcvlny.cv.net>

Hi, all...

I've been using 20 x 1.35 and 26 x 1.35 tires on my Vision R55. I've 
generally used Vredestein S-licks (now discontinued) or Schwalbe 
Kojaks (which develop a lot of nicks and cracks).

To deal with frequent punctures, I tried a set of Schwalbe Marathon 
Plus(es). Very heavy -- around 775 gr. But I did not get any flats at all.

However, my legs felt like concrete. My speed went down about 15%. 
Riding up any rise became a chore. I thought it was my age, but I 
swapped the Kojaks back, with extra rubber tubing in the vital spots, 
and my speed has gone way up along with my enjoyment.

I'm thinking of getting a pair of Primo Comets with a Kevlar belt 
under the tread. Though they do make a 20 x 1.35, they don't make a 
26 x 1.35. But they do make both a 20 x 1.50 and a 26 x 1.50.  They 
pretty much slicks, and they seem to be somewhat puncture resistant.

So, does anyone have any experience with these tires?

Would it be okay to mix and match -- a 20 x 1.35 front and a 26 x 
1.50 rear -- or would it be best to go with the 1.50 widths for both? 
(I'm assuming that the tires would fit on my current rims).

Thanks in advance. I'm looking forward to your input.

Yes, I've been using Schwalbe Kojaks on my commute bike for the past 1.5 years and on a previous commute bike several years ago used Primo Comet Kevlar belted tyres. I find the rate of punctures and general durability on the Kojaks to be similar to the Comet Kevlars but the Kojaks have better traction on wet roads and the folding bead version of the Kojaks I'm using is lighter weight than the Comets which are only available with wire beads.

The proposed setup would work and both widths of Comets will fit your current rims. Due to the weight distribution and impact loading characteristics of a bike with the layout of a Vision R55, ideally the smaller diameter front tyre would be wider than the larger diameter rear tyre which doesn't receive as much impact loading when going over potholes and such. So one possibility would be running the wider 40-406 version of the Comet up front and the 40-559 Comet in the rear. Another possibility would be running the narrower 37-406 Comet in front and a 32-559 Primo Racer in the rear. The Primo Racer has an identical tread and construction to the Primo Comet, it is just a different name used for the 32-559 and 25-559 versions of the 40-559 Comet. I don't know why they named those widths "Racer" and all their other tyres with this tread and casing design "Comet".
