After I developed some heart problems that limited my heart rate and wattage output, I put a Bionx pedelec system on my faired Challenge Hurricane.  My 10 mile commute time is back down to 35 min so I am riding more often.  Great for fast starts and hills, but governed to 20 mph max assist.  Probably fast enough anyway...



As for uprights, I have a Brompton in my office for quick short trips around campus and a Gazelle omafiets for stylish trips to the market.  But I wouldn't consider a "head first" for my bike trail commute; the risks of a header among the pedestrians are too great.



Good to read familiar voices on the list again...

Why is this sad? If you were to replace one Escalade with an electric you would save as much gas as replacing three Chevy Sonics. And Escalade owners are more likely to be able to afford the Early Adopter premium of a full electric.

Large SUVs suck but there is demand for them. And the more eVehicles on the road, the sooner costs will come down.

My dream vehicle would be a plug in hybrid Toyota Sienna minivan with solar panels on the garage. Minivans can carry so much more than SUVs but somehow they have gotten stigmatized.

Mark,

My reading of the research suggests that none of our technological advances
have reduced our consumption of resources.  Every increase in efficiency
leads to greater consumption.

something new. Minivans will come back into fashion when the kids riding

Veering off into solar space,

I have a friend who put too much solar on his house (overestimated is 
electricity usage) and got a Nissan Leaf to use the excess.
The installer that engineered my solar got it just about perfect. We pay 
$10/month during the months with sunshine in them.

My dream vehicle would be a velomobile, so that I could stay drier in 
the winter.  I also like the Ferrari Barchetta.

Here we have real winter so wet isn't often the problem. I prefer a trike with an extensive fairing over being trapped in a sweat box. http://mnhpva.org/ice/2005/pages/30.html
This way I'm dressed for the weather when I get off the bike. For rain, a simple cape 
turns it into a head out Velo and I have a helmet with a full visor.

My other winter ride is a highly modified '85 Trek (http://bikesmithdesign.com/MyBikes/snowmobile/winter3.jpg) with Winter Marathons, 700-35 in the front and 26" x 1.75 rear. It gets around great, even in thick, car churned "Mashed Potato" snow. 700-28 front/700-35 rear would be ideal but you work with what you have or can get.

I tried a 20x1.75 studded tire on an LWB but it just floated on the snow like it was hydroplaning. If I could get the WM or Kenda Klondike in a 451-28 I'd still be using an LWB 'bent in the winter. 
@ 67 y/o with osteoporosis it would be nice to be a little closer to the ground.

Barchetta huh? Been a long time since Ferrari's built anything that could be described as 'fun'.

At least I get out of the hospital tomorrow.)

Whats seriously sad is Tesla is getting all kinds of press for designing a 
vehicle that FEATURES a ridiculously low zero to sixty time.
This philosophy does tremendous damage to the environment by keeping people 
hooked on acceleration instead of range.

Yes I know Tesla is using the market place mentality to promote their 
business,
but I would rather support someone who is brave enough to challenge these 
19th century values.

I have been doing a on line search on small cars with small engines (600 to 
800 cc and electrified vehicles)some single seat vehicles(almost Velomobile 
in size) and found quite a number of them all in foreign countries. NONE in 
the US.

I also stumbled on a terrific video promoting narrow vehicles.

John,

I have that link, along with hundreds of others, in eight different files,
about alternative vehicles.  Yes, I have no life.

It is incredibly frustrating.  For the first time in my life, we can
convert any vehicle to electric power.  All we need to start is efficient
vehicles.  The US has nothing close.

Here is a perfect example.

http://www.edison2.com/

This thing would work for most people.  But it will never get built.  GM
had an identical concept vehicle, in 2002, that even had the electric
"skateboard" chassis that is now used in the Tesla, and BMW i3.  But an
aerodynamically efficient body is considered unsaleable.

The most exciting actual EV, so far, is a Zero motorcycle, with a Craig
Vetter designed fairing.

Anyone who has been into HPV's for as long as you have, can see what a
pathetic design this is.  Yet this is the best thing out there right now.

Not sure where this is headed, or if we will see it in the US. 

http://green.autoblog.com/2013/10/08/vw-xl1-gets-augmented-reality-repair-app/

I live in Tesla country (N. California). They are like Camrys here.  $150,000 seems crazy, but new technology in cars is starting to be like new technology used to be. Early adopters pay more.  If the technology is worthy, prices come down.  

People who have struck gold in the current California technology gold rush end up with more money than they know what to do with.  $150,000 for a car that shows that you are a cutting edge dude with lots of money is feasible.

At least in the transportation sector, I believe our consumption of resources is declining a bit.  Surely there are many causative factors, some economic and unrelated to efficiency, but surely efficiency gains get some of the credit.  According to EIA, gasoline consumption in the U.S. was down 6% from 2007 to 2011.

Continuation;

As an example;  7 or so years ago when I went up town to do my local 
shopping and running errands in my Foamshell VM people would stop by to talk 
to me about the vehicle.
At that time gas was $4 a gallon so they often said  my vehicle saved on gas 
money. $$$ not the environment. When the gas dropped to $3 the people 
disappeared.

A few years later and after some severe storms, such as Sandy in New Jersey
where I live, the public now say my vehicle is good for the ENVIRONMENT.
And there are many more people stopping to talk to me. And their enthusiasm 
comes out in their body language and their voices.

There are many more happy car horn toots, and "I love your vehicle" shouted 
from a passing car - and all the cell phone photos taken.

Meanwhile I can take a lane (for a while) and never get out of the way horn 
honks.

After riding bikes, streamliners, and VMs for 25 years this is a big change.

The public is interested, but not quite ready to get involved with a HPV.
What is needed is a nifty PRACTICAL local alternate transportation vehicle.

So that's what I am playing around with.

It's funny to see how these things become the item of the day. I've had a Focus Designs Self-Balancing Unicycle for a couple of years. I purchased v1, followed by v2 when it was released. V2 was a major improvement in performance and stability over v1, but I doubt that v3 is all that much of an improvement. More powerful motor though.

As a velomobile operator for mostly fun and errands, I prefer the HPV aspect of my transport. When I need to take a 2 mile trip to the market for a few items to stuff in a backpack, the SBU fits the bill. It is practical commuter gear, as I also have a bus pass and take it onboard with me if my travels might exceed 12 miles round trip. Anything longer and the velo takes top billing.


It's all about fun for me, though there's a lot of practicality in both the velomobile and the SBU.

OK, they're not human-powered, but, given the recent discussions of HP unicycles and more-or-less-fully electric bikes, I was amused to hear a piece on NPR regarding the not-so-obvious next step:

John,

I have been riding my e-assist LWB recumbent for two years now, and am
amazed at the reaction from most people.  All my adult life I have had
people angry at me for using "their" road.  Many would shout, "Get a motor
on that thing!"  When I finally did, most peoples attitudes changed 180
degrees.:-)

Most motorcyclists, and classic car and hot rod types love it.  Good ole
boys, in pickup trucks, give me the thumbs up, and little kids shout, "Cool
bike mister!"

But, except for the kids, they say they could/would never ride one.

Tom,

Yes.  Last year we went to the Lane Motor Museum, in Nashville.

http://www.lanemotormuseum.org/

Probably the biggest collection of small and aero cars in the US...Tatras,
Messerschmidts, etc.

I have spent a lot of time on electric car sites since 2009.  I am
constantly amazed that most of the people there have no interest in
aerodynamics, or small vehicles.  They say stuff like, "The VW XL1 is
retro-ugly."  The worst insult they can think of is "golf cart."  All they
talk about is bigger, more powerful batteries.  They consider any
concession to efficiency, like rear fender skirts, a defeat for EV's.

Although the Solar Challenge this year has added a category: Cruiser Class that is more practical they still are stuck with the premise that PV cells need to be part of the car. This necessarily makes for a larger vehicle while most road vehicles  in everyday use still only carry one driver.  All our automotive infrastructure is based around a standard capacity of five so that it can fit safely into a road network inhabited by eighteen wheelers or in the case of the Australian race in question the monstrous Road Trains. The race rules sensibly require a chase vehicle and a lead vehicle so this race is not even close to being an example for future cars except for the drivetrain efficiencies demonstrated.

 Interestingly it is the Dutch teams that have won this years race. They seem to be the only country with an extensive and useable dual network of inter community roads. One for cars and trucks and the other for bicycles.  

As world population goes up in dense areas we will need more and better single occupancy vehicles that can operate safely, and the luxury of two different and exclusive road networks is not likely to happen. Indeed the cheap fossil fuels that have given us the roads we have now will not be cheap forever and could end our world through the Greenhouse should we use as profligately just what we know exists now. What then must we do?

There was another X-prize winner, but most have not heard of it because it was thought even more outlandish to ordinary folk than the Edison. I refer to The X-Tracer electric cabin motorcycle. Unlike the Edison, it had air conditioning, and would go much faster. Based on the Swiss Monotracer BMW powered vehicle that can cruise for hours at 160mph autobahn speeds, the updated version powered by AC propulsion's electric drive(Tesla uses the same technology) is three times as efficient as the best of modern Electric Cars on the road today and holds two people.

So what is wrong with it?  Though it has outrigger wheels that retract and deploy in less than 20 miliseconds, it does not self balance. Until such time as that problem is solved, it is no more practical as primary transportation than that popular but very heavy rolling Performance Art Piece known as the Harley Davidson.

Now with the self balancing and self driving technologies beginning to show real promise, consider this: Two such vehicles can share a single lane at speeds well above the 55 mph averaged by the winning Solar Challenger this year, automatically and safely navigating amongst the truck traffic which will be similarly self driven with inter vehicle communications for near instantaneous braking response times allowing safe close following distances and thus more throughput per lane and more individual destinations per standard car footprint. 

Solar covered parking garages are becoming more and more common here in California and most vehicles spend most of their time not being driven, often on sunny days. It just makes sense.

The North American importer of the Monotracer is in Richmond, VA.

http://www.21stcenturymotoring.com/

I talked to him at the TTXGP races at VIR, back in 2010.  The Monotracer is
a truly amazing vehicle.  Built in Switzerland, it is breathtakingly
beautiful, and breathtakingly expensive.  The electric version is even more
incredibly priced.  That said, if I were a millionaire, I'd take one over a
Tesla in a heartbeat.

There were actually two different electric Monotracer designs built.  The
yellow, X-prize versions ran AC Propulsion drivetrains.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Propulsion

The red, Zero Race versions are equipped with Brusa drivetrains.

http://www.zerotracer.com/

As far as I know, the company had sold one electric version in the US, as
of this spring, but was having trouble getting it through customs, because
of no emissions documentation. :-(

The Lit Motors C1 is like most of the EV buzz...pure vapor.

As for EV's solving our climate change problem...that is like drinking diet
soda with your cake, to solve obesity.  This is the type of problem which
our species is not well equipped to deal with.  Studies show that we are
evolved to be overly optimistic.  When we didn't have a clue as to how the
universe worked, and where we were headed, just keepin' on truckin' was a
great strategy.  Even now, it is quite possible that we will be struck by a
huge asteroid, or a mega-volcano.  At that point we may be glad that we had
billions of people covering the planet.  Some might get through the
bottleneck.

But right now we have a problem that we really can predict with reasonable
mathematical precision, and our current path is a recipe for disaster.

Yes I was thinking of the Lit Motors machine. I have yet to see video of it performing above the mid thirty mph range however. I suspect that the processing power and speed isn't there yet. It is actually based upon a one hundred year or more old idea tried both on rail and land vehicles. Both were quite limited  in speed as the feedback loops were mechanical. Safety will be the governing principle for the time of  arrival of both self driving and self balancing. In the event that the popular will never allows it to come to fruition we can still ride our bikes to get more people more places with just the streets we have. CycLAvia is becoming popular in LA, where gridlock is an all daylight hours phenomenom these days.

Paul,

That does appear to be true.  However, you are only looking at the auto
sector.  I was referring to work by economists trying to determine if it is
possible to have a "steady state" economy.  What they find is that
economies are like balloon animals.  If you squeeze them in one place, they
pop out somewhere else.  Presumably, that decrease in auto travel was
replaced by spending on smart phones, craft beer, or tattoos.  Even a
service economy uses energy, and globally, despite the staggering
recession, our energy use continues to increase.

Sorry to be such a downer.  My friends tell me I am no fun at parties.  But
I can say, I have never been unhappy about going for a bicycle ride.  :-)

And I still think your Honda is one of the coolest cars on the planet!

The concept is very appealing.  But I don't see it as a real vehicle.
 Electric vehicles already have the challenge of high battery cost, and

Quick mention that a major deal is to switch away from fossil for IC-engines on the planet, they will not disappear.
 
The best way to do that is algae, people in areas are growing it for biodiesel in blue-tarp lined pits, luv the internet, pressing it in cloth to get the oil and this is spreading where cash jobs are scarce, it's used for cooking and heating as well. 
 
For high-tech societies it's straightforward to use the sewage treatment plant to make the biodiesel with wastewater effluent feeding the algae and it's worth about 7L/2gal per day per person on a city system (this is more than a person produces in waste, add in a laundromat or twenty), and for comparison the USA burns 6L/1.6gal a day per person in all types of transportation fuels. 
 
The algae are good water cleaners and with ongoing improvements in harvesting it's today less costly to fully recycle the water using nano-filtration which removes smaller items than viruses for tertiary treatment, Lake Tahoe in the Sierra's has had total purification & recycling since the 70's but it's been too expensive using chemicals and activated charcoal to be common.
 
To change things, start talking biodiesel from wastewater for your local sewage treatment plant if you want to make a dent in CO2 emissions, biodiesel can run in any engine, specialists are around to convert a car and while it's not perfect for a solution this is the only true "transition" fuel until something better comes up to run all the existing machines and still cut CO2 radically.
 
Making it removes CO2 and emits O2 so the carbon-footprint is tiny compared to fossil anything and it's not a food crop, to make it doesn't require arable land and we produce it daily.

This is a parallel hybrid, which should make it slightly more efficient.

I can't imagine any real value to non-plugin hybrids.

I went back and reread Andreas' article again.  He wasn't claiming any
increase in efficiency, but an increase in design flexibility.

As I thought, with a setup like mine, where you constantly shift to keep
you and the motor in the most efficient rpm range, there would be no
efficiency benefit.

Electric vehicles are not just coming, they are here. Pedelecs of all sorts are selling well in all parts of the world that haven't had the suburban sprawl business plan (Copyrighted first here in the Los Angeles area).  For we who are unfortunate enough to live with the byproduct of the "one car sized transport fits all living style"  endemic to this and so many other U.S. regions the automobile sized solution will not go away soon. I was proposing a way to wean our ordinary aging population off that particular modus operandi with technology able to utilize the infrastructure we  now have while doubling capacity.

Battery cost is descending rapidly and automation likewise so this will continue apace as did the gasoline auto of one hundred years ago that was similarly denigrated. I am old enough to remember "get a horse" as an epithet for stranded motorists.  At that time the urban infrastructure favored rail, an even heavier mode when mostly empty.

As a recumbent, faired bicyclist by choice I agree that we have the corner on ultimate transport efficiency as long as we are willing to dice with the cars. I am retired now, but  years ago I tried using my F-40 type streamliner for one of the longest commutes I allowed myself to do in my work life, 50 miles each way. To put this in perspective, I moved to my present home of 48 years to be within walking distance of my workplace. 

 Here in greater LA, fifty miles is not uncommon, and I was lucky to have both the stamina built up from my 2000 cross the U.S. trip and an almost fully "bike trailed" commute route. Not just any bike trail either. The San Gabriel River trail is almost without stops from the ocean 35 miles to Duarte, the town adjacent to my workplace.  My F-40 could be made to do the trip in three hours or less on almost flat ground. Only about 500ft of gain. It still came at a high price in my ability to perform my work, and transit on the same route would have taken as long. Sadly I returned to my 39mpg car.

 So perhaps you can see why I think that, while we need to contain our travel to more eco-friendly distances,  despite the limitations of electric transport, it can serve as an intermediate mode, if adopted by the people who would never bother to read this list.

Averaged three passengers, and 41.5 mph, for 1,860 miles, with no outside
power supplied.

The first cruiser class car over the line beat them by 1 hour, 23 minutes,
and was much sexier looking, but could only carry two, and mostly carried
one.

"I moved to my present home of 48 years to be within walking distance of my
workplace."

Man!  You must be a professional.  After building this bermed, passive
solar house 34 years ago,on the closest land to town we could afford, the
Trailways buses quit stopping here.  Riding 25 miles each way, would have
added three hours to my work day, and ended my marriage.  The idea of
working in the same place for more than five years was something only
professionals, and now perhaps only tenured professors can hope for.  My
longest run was 13 years as a technician at a school, which closed when the
industry we supported went to Asian.

Ironically, I could have done it on the electric assist bike I have now.
 But, unfortunately, I am retired.  :-)
