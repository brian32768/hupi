<PRE>Patterson had this effect factored into his model, and I don't know why they
are referencing Ruina.  Increased trail means more fork flop,less
sensitivity, and more stability.  Raising the center gravity just increases
longitudinal rotational moment of inertia. This means the angular
acceleration is less, and you do not go down as fast when you lose tire
traction.  It also means that there is more time for the stabilizing
feedback effect from the trail induced front wheel direction change that
acts to counter the heeling angle of the bike.  

The bottom line is the higher you are the more time you have for recovery
when you lose traction (your angular acceleration is less), and given an
effective amount of trail the more stable you are. Bents fix the loss of
longitudinal moment of inertia by increasing the trail, and of course the
annoying fork flop that goes along with it.  

The lower you are to the ground the faster you go down, and the reason why
is very simple. Trail is very important on a recumbent.  They basically do
not work without it.

What are the implications of this research for 'bents, if any? Seems  
to be saying that the CG height at the front of the bike is important.  
'Bents change that dramatically.

How valid is this experiment if it does not include the weight of a  
rider? Seems like they have demonstrated the factors affecting the  
stability of a _riderless_ bike - only?
