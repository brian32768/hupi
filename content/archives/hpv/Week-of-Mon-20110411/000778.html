This is quite fascinating. As a small wheel bike enthusiast from the  
time of the late sixties ( I had an early sixteen inch wheeled Silk  
folder from Japan) I tried to reason out why the reduced gyroscopic  
forces didn't make for its poor handling as much as did the general  
loosey-goosey connections  with which it folded. I was introduced to  
the steering trail idea when I discussed this with others, and took  
that to be the basic mechanism. This test buck that they created makes  
me think that another thought I had at that time might have some  
validity. What went through my mind was the idea of balancing a broom  
on one's finger tip. Standing still it is just a matter of moving the  
finger in the direction of the incipient fall and with a bit of  
overcorrection it begins to fall in the opposite direction, but when  
one moves forward at a steady pace one creates a vector force that  
doesn't seem to need to be fully corrected until one tries to stop in  
place. i.e. it is allowed to fall forward  and is only corrected for  
neutral rate of fall and left/right bias in that fall.

Now that I think about their test buck a little more it seems that the  
weight adjustment beam with its mass hanging forward of the steering  
axis creates a ballistic trajectory that the two-wheel system must  
follow even if the (somewhat) gyro neutralized front wheel pair has  
negative trail.  If the &quot;handlebar&quot; ends are not accelerated  in one  
direction of rotation or the other enough to flip around to positive  
trail they act as mass dampers to keep the trail negative. As well the  
rear wheel's drag gives trail to the whole assembly.

I await any correction of my (possibly) misguided thoughts from better  
minds than my own.
