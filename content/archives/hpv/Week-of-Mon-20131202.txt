OzHPV usually does it that way, and so do most of the other contests I've seen. Watching someone try to drive a velomobile while holding on to bulky luggage is always funny. OTOH, I usually get disqualified for turning up :)

I have a quad with a trailer... load capacity 440 litres/250kg in the bins, more on top

... and I have to put some pics of my big four wheel trailer up sometime. Slow (it's big) but 300-500kg capacity, 1m x 2.4 load platform.

... per a PRI story that I can't find on their website. Looks more like a Copenhagen Hub, but I guess that's not as marketable:

Hmm - single speed - no apparent gears.  Battery mass appears to rotate - looks like a winner.

Except that I thought it had sort of been done before.

I am beginning to be sceptical of these crowd funding projects.

The only value to non-plug-in hybrid drives, in ICE vehicles, is the poor
torque characteristics of ICE, that it allows you to shut it off when
stopped, and regen braking.  How does any of that apply to a human?  I
can't believe you could recover enough energy braking to offset the added
weight and drag of this thing.  And the CO2 to make them would swamp any
imaginable benefit of the data collected.
