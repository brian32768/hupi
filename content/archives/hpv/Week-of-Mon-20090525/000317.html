</I>The people that complain about wearing &quot;funny&quot; clothes while riding
bicycles are the same kind of people that don't do physical labor
because it will make them sweat. Being outdoors in TX for longer than
it takes to walk from office to car precludes wearing most forms of
regulation office wear, and the sooner some people wise up to that the
better off the rest of us will be. If you have to be work-ready as
soon as you come through the door, and there's no place to change,
then you need to find another job. Employers who attempt to dictate
transportation choices are no better than ones that dictate other
choices outside of the work environment.
