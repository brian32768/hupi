</I>Well, I have an office with a door, and the bathroom has a shower, so I 
could were whatever and change. However, since it is only 9-km to work, 
a leisurely ride in wearing wicking fabric normal clothes is a nice 
option to have. In addition, just being able to jump on the bike for a 
short hop in comfort without changing is also good.
