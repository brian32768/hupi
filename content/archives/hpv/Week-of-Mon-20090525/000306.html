<PRE>Where I ride a bike, cow manure and mud represent common shoe
accessories. Mostly there is no one around 'ere who cares a spit what I
look like when riding or working outdoors, certainly not  the antelope
that's been hanging around around the fields.  Mom Nature alone pretty
much dictates my day's wardrobe selection.

Wear what you want, when you want, for whatever reason you want. You
have a choice.  Consider though when picking out duds whether the
bicycle is your destination or if it is the means to get to a
destination, something that might be totally unrelated to bicycling.
Being yourself on a bike is the core of the Cycling Chic movement, which
started in Copenhagen and is becoming a global phenomena. Quoting
Colville-Andersen it's about &quot;Regular people in regular clothes on a
variety of bicycles. But as we all know by now, it's not about the
bicycle, it's about YOU on the bicycle.&quot;

Put it another way. If a person wears their everyday normal clothing
while bicycling, then bicycling more easily becomes an everyday normal
part of life.
