What you've observed triggers an odd thought. Coats and jackets keep us 
warm. That's their original and best reason for existing.  But 
strangely, the typical modern office coat for both men and women has 
evolved to be something worn only in artificial climate controlled 
conditions.

 
When I'm outdoors in moving air, such as on a bike, I rarely get wet 
from my own sweat even in the hottest temperatures. It's only after I 
walk indoors immediately after a physical exertion that sweating becomes 
an issue to contend with --- like dripping a puddle of water from my 
arms onto somebody's desk, counter top or pickm'uptruck. 

Red face time. Big time.

&lt;fiction&gt;&quot;Oops, excuse the quirks of my species' biology, man. Sorry, 
dude I'm a cyclist. we are genetically similar to Wokies, dolphins and 
big slobbery dogs. We drip when pulled indoors too quick. Arrooo.&quot;
