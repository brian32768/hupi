<PRE>Elrey cops to the fact that in one of the early VeloVisons he is
quoted as loving Coolmax fabric for riding clothes.

That was then. Wool is now. You used to need Woolite to wash your
woolies. Not anymore. Special tip: it washes great in those porcelain
washing machines in hotel rooms, next to the shower. You just push the
flush button and get a fresh rinse. Gotta love that. Too bad you have
to kneel down to use 'em tho.
