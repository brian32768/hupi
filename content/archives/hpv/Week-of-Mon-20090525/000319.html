<PRE>One thing I learned, though it's tough to preach it, is that it is the
clothes that stink. Most &quot;modern&quot; hi-tech fabrics (no, I haven't tried
them all ... this comes from a fabric science major) need to be washed
in super hot water to not get stinkier as they age. Perhaps one of
these new steam washers would answer for that. For me, I wear wool on
top all year-round, and my supply of Boosucker shorts ships today from
Rivbike.

Elrey in sweaty wool and Musa shorts, off to pick up neutered feral
cat on Trice and Bikes-at-Work 8' trailer.
