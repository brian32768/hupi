<PRE>I live in Ormond Beach, Fla. just next to Daytona, the Motorcycle capital of the world, or so they say.  About a month ago during &quot;Bike Week&quot; I noticed a lot more trikes.  But what interested me was so many now are add-ons.  They actually have 3 wheels in the back.

 

I have 3 recumbents, a Kettwiesel, a Gold Rush and a Vision Metro.  For some time I have wanted to convert my Vision to a Trike.  However the conversion kits I found available did not provide for proper gearing.  

 

Getting older I am having more problems clicking in and then getting started again at stops.  So I though why not training wheels.  Seeing the 3 wheeled motorcycles gave me the idea to try it.

 

First I found a 2 child bike trailer for sale.  I took it and removed everything but the lower frame and wheels. I then narrowed it by three inches. Then attached it to my Metro after much thought and the help of a friend.  It took several modifications of our ideas but today after changing some shims ----- IT WORKS!!!!

 

I only road it around the block today so it has not been road tested.  It rides great going straight.  Going around corners it feels like it is going over so no fast turning.  So for $45 for the used trailer and $12 for some aluminum I have another trike .. I think.  

 

I now have to put some miles on it around the neighbor to get a final opinion or to make any modifications.  Anyway it has been fun.  I would be glad to send a picture to anyone wanting one.  I am also open to any ideas on other ways to accomplish the same thing or ideas on how to improve what I have built.
