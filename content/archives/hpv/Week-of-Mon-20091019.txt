Hah!  I came across this contraption on the Burke Gilman Trail in Seattle WA about a month ago.  Fabulous!  A large van with a flatbed trailer was just pulling up to load it and take it up the steep hill adjacent.  Absolutely required stopping and staring!  For once my Thys Rowingbike was rendered dull and ordinary.

I just saw this today in the news: 
 
>> a mechanical masterpiece made of 3 bicycle wheels, 
>> a mounted Street View camera, and a very athletic cyclist

Here's a simple technique claimed to trigger inductive sensors for 
traffic signals. Has anyone tried this?

I call B.S. Since the field falls off as the cube of the distance, 
sticking the magnet 10" from the pavement isn't going to be detectable 
at all. Better you place your wheels over the wires of the loop(s). See 
<http://www.humantransport.org/bicycledriving/library/signals/detection.htm> 
for more information.

The salient phrase here is "if they are properly configured and adjusted." This seems frequently not to be the case.
