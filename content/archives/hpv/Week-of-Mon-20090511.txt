Message-ID: <BD9DD46F-9E13-46F3-9D75-1CF11E4A5B01@earthlink.net>

I just learned HED no longer produces the Jet rim in 559 mm. Does  
anyone else make an aerodynamic deep section (40-60 mm deep) rim in  
the 559 mm diameter. I know it is a small market since mountain bikes  
don't often use aero wheels. HED does still make the Jet in the 406  
mm and 451 mm diameters.

Message-ID: <20090514215001.116D4141DB441@cedar.isis.unc.edu>


I'd appreciate suggestions regarding means by which to carry both my
Lightning Stealth SWB and a conventional upright bike on a Toyota
Highlander. Why I ask:

I've hooked up with a woman who bike-commutes daily and occasionally
bike-tours. We're thinking about taking a trip which might be too long
for us to do entirely by bike, so we're thinking about driving (with
her Toyota Highlander mini-SUV) the bikes to the destination and
biking around there. I've never bought a bike rack before, much less
one to carry both a recumbent (my Lightning Stealth SWB) and a
conventional upright (her Miyata road bike), so I'd appreciate
suggestions (either via the list or direct to me) on what to look for,
etc. FWIW we're in central NC (Carrboro) so we have, e.g., a
Performance outlet, an REI, and several LBS nearby, but there aren't
any serious recumbent shops in the neighborhood. (The closest of the
latter of which I'm aware is Neighborhood Transportation in
Lewisville, which isn't too close.)

We use the Sportworks style racks.  Saris also has one.  Sportworks sold 
the rack design to Thule, works great for my CAero and my kids/wifes 
road bike.

Try a Draftmaster. We can easily configure a Draftmaster for either a 2.0
inch or 1.25 inch receiver, and carrying 1 SWB recumbent and 1 upright bike
is an easy fit for our HR-2 configuration. Draftmaster racks feature a quick
connect, modular design so removal for storage and/or to reconfigure for
different carrying needs is fast and easy.

All Draftmaster and Topper Racks are made in the USA at Atoc's factory in
the Seattle area, by our own employees.

Atoc is a manufacturer so we prefer that you buy our rack systems thru one
of our dealers when possible. If we do not have a dealer in your area (and
we do not have a dealer in the Carrboro NC vicinity at this time) you are
welcome to order directly from Atoc.

For more info see www.Atoc.com or www.Draftmaster.com, or give us a call at
(800) ATOC-021. Our phone hours are 9-5 M-F Pacific time.

If you will all excuse me, now I have to go get ready to pedal to work.
After all, it is Bike To Work Day! Yes, I ride to work more often than just
BTWD.

Since my morning commute consists of walking from the bedroom to the
kitchen for a cup of coffee and then back to the bedroom to fire up
the computer, I did not ride my bicycle to work today. That right hand
turn at the end of the hall just isn't big enough to let me ride a
bicycle through.

100% this week, and haven't gotten wet yet.  Even rode downtown Monday lunch 
hour for the special Bike-to-Work event put on by the Chamber of Commerce. 
Half a dozen local politicians and businessmen spoke, otherwise rather

Aye --

Today I rode my Raleigh Aleyska-- lugged double-butted frame, set up
Rivendell style with moustache bars, Nitto stem, and Brooks B17
saddle, matching powdercoated frame and front and rear racks.

I like this bike so much I even clean it after it rains.

We don't do bike-to-work week here in Corvallis, platinum level LAB
bicycle city (or maybe gold, I forget). NEXT week is "Get there
another way" week; I usually ignore that and pedal or walk anyway. We
do the bike commute challenge in the fall.

I did actually, even though I hadn't originally planned to.  While I
normally ride to work most of the year, I usually end up driving during
most of Bike Week because the advocacy organization that I'm involved with
(http://www.biketreasurevalley.org) puts on the Bike Week events and I end
up schlepping more stuff all over town than I want to try to carry on my
bike.  But I got lucky today and I didn't have to carry anything, so I
rode to the event this morning in downtown Boise, then back out to work. 
So far I've put in about 20 miles more than my typical daily commute, and
I still have to get home.

I'll second that.  I have a Draftmaster that I bought several years ago
when we bought a Rans Tailwind for my wife.  With the tandem tray, we
could carry her bike, my VRex, and the kids uprights.  Overall it's a
great system.

However, the kids are now gone and my wife's knees are shot, so I don't
have much use for it anymore.  So not to take business away from Charlie,
if anybody is interested in a used rack and wants to come to Boise to pick
it up, I've got a 5-bike carrier that I can sell.  I'm keeping the tandem
tray though.  It works on top of the pop-up trailer and I keep hoping that
my wife will be able to ride again someday.

a different coffee shop where I am camped out today with the laptop  
(virtual office).  Maybe only an hour of riding, but about 1000 ft of

I did. I commute daily except when there is snow and ice on the road (upstate NY.) I got drenched last night on the way home. Time to get out the waterproofing solution again. It is a pleasant 2.5 mile trip each way on rural roads with a few minor hills to climb each way?:-)

I've been house sitting for a friend that is a 55 km round trip  
commute and have been doing the commute on my HP Velotechnik Scorpion  
trike. I noticed on the "Bike To Work Day" there was a large mobile  
digital sign on San Pablo Avenue in Oakland just south of the  
Berkeley boarder which alternately flashed "SHARE THE ROAD" and "BIKE  
TO WORK DAY MAY 14TH". When I saw the sign I thought there should be  
signs like that up every day, not just this day. This morning on my  
commute I noticed the sign is still up.

still havn't got a quick practical solution for shoes.

With the Wisconsin weather turning better, I am currently blessed with an
8 mile commute by bike to the jobsite.  This is rare - usually in
construction I am going 30-50 miles daily one way.   So I get to commute
by bike for now!   Right now, weather wimp that I am, that's 2-3 days per
week, on the yellowbike2 (TE clone, somewhat altered geometry).    I love
the early morning sunrise from the bike path!   Wisconsin and Milwaukee
listen to a different drum on Bike-to-Work - the Wisconsin Bike
Federation has set June 7-12 as Bike-to-Work week.   And I certainly
will, IF I am still working at that point.   

Heck, if I am not on the job, "work" is in the toy shoppe out back MAKING
bikes.   I can't regard that as work (too much fun), but if that is the
full time 'gig' for a while, I most certainly will bike FROM work when
the sunlight calls me.   

Cheers!  ADC

Don't use shoes.  Use SPD sandals instead.  They don't hold the water and
with appropriate socks (including waterproof socks), you can use them all
year.

Performance has some sandals:

And REI has some SealSkinz socks:

You may be able to find better prices though.

Hi Guys (and Gals) - I do still exist, and faithfully
monitor the list. I did not realize that it was Bike to Work
Day, however I did my daily 6.2 mile bike commute from home
to my office on our beautiful bike path along the Hocking
River. I still use Grasshopper 5 (now in its 10th year)
since it is the perfect bike:

I used to agree with Dwight on this front, but the new Shimano MT60 goretex hike/bike shoes have changed my mind.  They are very comfortable, weatherproof, and look normal.

Don't use shoes.  Use SPD sandals instead.  They don't hold the water and
with appropriate socks (including waterproof socks), you can use them all
year.

Performance has some sandals:

And REI has some SealSkinz socks:

You may be able to find better prices though.

Izzi,

Wouldn't the perfect bike have a much higher capacity for torque conversion
for those nasty Athens hills? :)

Having disposed of my car 9 years ago, it is easier to post exceptions when 
driving rather than riding.
 
I rode the nine miles round trip on my primary commuter of the last four 
years, a Giro 26.  I use a Bacchetta Big Bag (seat mounted) for clothing and 
light shopping.
 
No additional commuter bike traffic noted on route.  More folks are riding 
now along the beach that the summer weather pattern is in place.
 
Mike

I sure did! On a Tour Easy Farmer's Axe.

Yep, had the same axe for 19 years, replaced the handle 5 times and the head
twice!

In Colorado we have Bike to Work Day/Week in June.  It is not that we are wimps, but we can get a big snowstorm in May.  Despite being booked up with soccer practices and other things that force me to drive my car, I have managed to ride about once per week.  We had dry weather in January and February and that helped out.  It was so nice that I used the V2 Formula for commuting this winter instead of the police auction mtn bike.

I do love to see the interest in bike commuting.

John
