</I>....I agree. 

&gt;<i>(1) (recumbent CdA)/(upright CdA) = 2.4/2.9 = 0.83 
</I>considering the HUGE downhill speed advantage of a recumbent over an upright, I would expect this ratio to be no greater than 0.67 
.........Reasonable comments. These are generally accepted CdA numbers by many HPV researchers. I have made coast down measurements that confirm those values. My little FWD is around 2.3. There are a few very low recumbents that may be a bit faster and quite a few slower than my bike. That is why I chose 2.4. Some up rights may be slightly less than 2.9 specially if the riders is down on the drops. But this would be unlikely when climbing. 

To get down to a ratio of 0.67 that means the bent has to be around 2 - only the most radical are are down that low. 

Plugging the same numbers into TCoastF1 spreadsheet  for a 6 % down grade the terminal speed for the up-right would be 37 mph and the recumbent 42. That's pretty huge. Even a 1 or 2 mph difference in speed appears to be huge, particularly if is over many seconds.  

&gt;<i>compared with the &quot;drive train eff of 97%&quot; for uprights, this means the intermediate idler converts 3% of its throughput to heat, which is unlikely. 1% or less is much more plausible, my estimate being 0.5% . 
</I>....again that's a typical value that is used by many recumbent designers. If the angle the chain over the idler is very small then yes  that idler efficiency will be higher. Bachetta (and other like designs) particularly made sure that angle is minimal. And with its short boom and large diameter stiff frame they climb well. P-38s also climb well with it short boom and stiff space frame and very small chain angle over an idler. 

But say on a FWD with a better than 90 degree change of chain line the loss is probably well into the 4% regon. 
The 97% on  the up right is only if the chain line is lined up with the chain ring and cog. Any crossover and that efficiency drops. 

Someone in the WISIL group made this measurement some years ago and noted how quickly the efficiency drops vs chain angle. 

Another issue is frame flex. As I point out with the Bachetta and P-38 both have stiff frames. But many bents have rather long booms. That flex can also be power robbing. That's where the diamond frame is far superior. 
Its too bad the human factors are so poor.
