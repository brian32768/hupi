</I>&gt;<i> Another issue is frame flex. As I point out with the Bachetta and  
</I>&gt;<i> P-38 both have stiff frames. But many bents have rather long booms.  
</I>&gt;<i> That flex can also be power robbing. That's where the diamond frame  
</I>&gt;<i> is far superior.
</I>&gt;<i> Its too bad the human factors are so poor.

Has anyone proven that frame flex = energy loss?

Cites, links?

&quot;Bicycle Quarterly&quot; magazine has done research on this (along with  
tire efficiency) and it was recently discussed on the iBOB list. The  
general idea is that a flexy frame seems to be faster and that the  
energy of flexing isn't lost, that steel is a great spring. It was  
noted that race bikes tend to be flexier than touring bikes to begin  
with and that top racers have used race bikes that were flexier than  
most (Sean Kelly, Fignon). Publisher Jan Heine has mentioned that  
there doesn't seem to be research showing that a flexy frame is  
slower. However, it's likely that all flex isn't desireable, but what  
and where hasn't been sorted out yet. &quot;BQ&quot; promotes the idea that a  
certain type of flexy frame is desirable because it &quot;planes&quot; -- a  
skilled rider uses a cadence that works with the flex to give a ride  
that's superior in several ways.

&quot;BQ&quot; has lamented that relevant, real-world, real-road bike research  
isn't often done or supported by the bike industry. However, it seems  
to me that university engineering students/profs would be interested  
in such testing and have facilities, etc.
