<PRE>I agree that having a low center gravity helps a bike handle quicker.  That is the flip side of falling quickly.  But my reaction times have never been that fast, John, and they aren't getting any faster as I get into my late 60s.  When I hear &quot;sand&quot; I start looking for another route!

I brought up the topic because I have been asked many times over the years whether a recumbent is hard to ride.  When I was younger I answered, &quot;not really&quot;; but as I get older and my bikes get lower, I answer, &quot;yes a little harder&quot; due to the feeling of instability or twitchiness.  I am still wondering whether a high recumbent would feel more stable, but I cannot afford to fall from that height any more.

Some suggested a trike for ultimate stability, but the aerodynamic, rolling resistance, and weight advantages keep me wanting to be on two wheels; though I can see a velomobile a few years in my future.  

But looking at the big picture, for long distance commutes of the low carbon future, perhaps on dedicated routes designed for high speed biking, the streamlined low recumbent bicycle clearly offers the highest speeds with the least effort.  But the instability problem is a real issue, I think.

&gt;<i>the recumbent makes it difficult for the rider to maneuver his body for control, as is 
</I>done on an upright bike. 
.....I have a very low short wheel base recumbent. The seat bottom is 7 inches above the ground. 
To me that low weight is an big advantage particularly in quickness in handling. I ride with up rights and when they see sand on a corner they shout out SAND and quickly slow down. I continue my speed, and with micro inputs ot the direct steering handlebars I can throw my bike hard into the corner before the sand, straighten it out during the sand, and throw it hard to finish the corner, and leave all the up rights far behind. You cant do all that quick handing with a high CG. Moving the body is too slow. Too much mass. 


And no wonder the up rights are more cautious.  If you fall from that height your going to hurt your self. Hands arms shoulders and worse your head and face are very vulnerable. On a low bike if you do go down the seat hits first and then you get some road rash on a thigh. You definitely don't go flying over the handlebars. 

On rough road down hills I can more often pick my path . And I go much faster down hills than the up rights because part of that is the much better aero. I also have fatter tires which handle the bumps much better. 

Yes I'm a bit slower up hills but I'm a lot older than most I ride with (77 vs 50s).   I generally gain so much flying down grades (light pedaling or coasting) and in using less energy on the flats that I get to the hills before them. 

My bike is closer to 30 pounds with fenders, luggage rack and small panniers. I use the bike as local alternate transportation. Their bikes are 17 to 20 ponds and can only carry a hankie. Put decent wheels and tires, fenders, luggage rack and panniers on a up right and they aren't so fast up hills.
