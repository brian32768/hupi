I have never been a good climber, and am only marginally better now because 
my HPV has gotten me to ride much more often than I did in my DF riding 
days. Now certain conventions of description have arisen since the beginning of 
the modern movement. 

HPV's are inclusive of all bikes, trikes and quads, but the term velomobile 
has come to mean only a trike. I would argue that my modifications to my 
Lightning P-38 over almost 20 years of riding have made it a velomobile for my 
purposes. I have ridden it almost exclusively with a fairing of some sort 
from the time that I built it up as a frame kit in 1990. From the beginning I 
have only used clip-in shoes for the rare occasions when I attend a formal 
racing event, there for I have not had the inconvenience of low speed 
balance that riding with clips entails. I started with Winwood insteps when I had 
Look type pedals and now with speedplays I have built my own &quot;shoe pockets&quot; 
for riding with street shoes.

My climbing is thus less stressfull as I can drop a foot for a few moments 
of rest and breath recovery, just like I do at every major stop sign and 
traffic light( &quot;California rolling stops&quot; at the rest). What this has meant is 
that I have found that faired riding on two wheels is practical with some 
compromises to maximum speed for the vehicle/rider combo. An open bottom to 
the shell is one of those compromises. A slightly less efficient pedal 
connection is another, but I still manage to drop most of the challengers I see 
coming in my rear view mirror on the flats and can sometimes even stay ahead of 
them on the 3% hill I have getting back home. I couldn't do that without 
the fairing.

I have the greatest respect for what John Tetz has been able to do building 
some of the best homebuilt, practical low streamlined bikes   and   trikes 
I have seen, but his need for speed is greater than mine. I do applaud him 
for his abilities   given his ten years seniority. I hope I will be as active 
when I get there. I will stick to my faired P-38 for now because it keeps 
me at a height equal to the eye level of the cars I encounter and people in 
cars seldom fail to notice that big yellow fairing nose.

 The inconvenience of fairing entry through my door flaps is about the same 
or less, in my mind, as getting down into a velomobile trike.   I can be on 
my feet at an intersection in an instant for increased visibility, and with 
the strap across the seatback in one hand, and the handlebar neck in the 
the other, I can revise my direction, even reverse it with out fully 
dismounting. The single track of the bicycle I find superior for narrow shouldered 
roadways and pothole dodging.

 I fact, now when I ride a DF I notice right away the gyroscopic forces on 
the large front wheel that keep me from the line I would take if on my 
Lightning.   I also find that the twitchiness inherent in the P-38's adherence to 
racing bike steering parameters is nicely damped by that fairing's wind 
loading.   I have had but a handfull of spills in the nearly twenty years   
I've owned it, and only obtained minor road rash on two of those occasions, one 
because I was in racing clips.
 The fairing material, except for the nose is made from a rugged HD 
polyethylene single sheet, not coroplast, and has come through those spills with 
only minor damage. I used the same set of side doors for more than ten years, 
before rebuilding them last year. The old ones, though ugly, are still 
servicably free of rips and tears. The panniers I made ten years ago from the 
same material can still be distorted to hold the contents of three grocery bags 
and return to their aero shape once I unload them.
