That makes a lot of sense if drivetrain loss is completely from the idler, but that doesn't seem reasonable because fixies and other bikes without idlers don't have 100% efficient drivetrains. It's been a long time since I've looked at the data, but 98% occurs to me as the high figure for chain-drive without idler, meaning that the idler is wasting an additional 1% -- so a second idler would waste 1% of the remaining 97%, leaving about 96% -- which is about what I would expect.
