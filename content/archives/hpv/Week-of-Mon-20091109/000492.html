<PRE>Hello Stuart and Ben;

Wonderful comments. 

&gt;<i>and they aren't getting any faster as I get into my late 60s. 
</I>.....I too know the feeling. I'm 77 and its definitely getting  a bit slower. But by &quot;exercising&quot; that part of the brain I'm doing ok (for my age). Practice  Practice Practice helps. And Ego. Doing whatever it takes to go faster is driven by ego. 

&gt;<i>whether a recumbent is hard to ride. 
</I>....I ysay yes. If you balance a broom on your hand the weight is up high, and the hand can easily move quick enough. But as that weight is lowered the hand has to become quicker and quicker. Anticipation of where it might go  helps. But the body is amazing. It can learn to do all this. 

Tour Easys are easy to ride because of the long wheel base. But I cant stand to ride them. They feel like I'm steering a tugboat. I like the feeling when the vehicle is an extension of my body. My first bent was a used P-38. The original rider couldn't handle it. 

&gt;<i> trike for ultimate stability, but the aerodynamic, rolling resistance, and weight advantages keep me wanting to be on two wheels;
</I>....That's exactly what I thought (actually Rolling resistance is the same). I said when I get old I get a trike. But 4 years ago I wanted to investigate a VM. And now its my all time favorite alternate transportation vehicle. So I guess that makes me officially old. 

But seriously running erands and such is SOOOOOOO much more comfortable on a trike. You come to a intersection and look for traffic. If something is coming you calmly put on the brakes. On take off there is none of that wiggling while you struggle for balance. You spend more time checking the intersection than worrying about stopping or starting. 

If I ride only the trike for a month then when I do get on a bike (my low FWD is really quick) I wobble just a bit until my brain becomes used to spending energy on balance. It takes quite a few miles for it to adjust. 

&gt;<i>the streamlined low recumbent bicycle clearly offers the highest speeds with the least effort. 
</I>.....I did many many years of streamlining. Thrilling. I also used it for alternate transportation particularly in the winter. But it's a pain in the ass. Talk about tension coming into a intersection !!!!!. Getting at least one foot unclipped (hopefully the correct one), then holding it up with the feet in a narrow stance near the center of the vehicle (particularly in a cross wind), then taking off, WHEW.  None of this in a VM,. Plus there is more room in a VM. 

Streamliners are great for cross country. Nothing can keep up. On occasions I go out and kick the asses of the young guys (ego ego ego). Hey I'm using my brains not my long gone brawn. 
I also did a lot of long distance touring in a F-40 - a very practical vehicle. 
But it gave little or no protection when going down. I lost some precious skin. That's what drove me to hard shell (noisy, expensive materials, throw away materials, and labor intensive and toxic). Then I discovered Zote foam and haven't looked back. 

&gt;<i>But the instability problem is a real issue, I think. 
</I>.....Im assuming your talking about cross winds. The F-40 was fine, The Spandex caved in softening the side push. And say a wind hit the vehicle from the left.  It automatically pushes the wheels to the right making the vehicle lean into the wind. If you relax and don't try to stop this action the wander is fairly  small. But if you fight it the wander is much greater. Having direct steering helps a lot. You can put in micro adjustments with your fingers minimizing the wander. Again the body learns how to react. 
A streamliner is like flying a plane. Its not for every one, whereas a VM is.  

I get a little wander in the VM too. At really high speed I would rather be in a streamliner. If you go down your falling from a low position. In a VM there is a possibility of turning over and that means doing a high sider. Ugly. So i definitely don't go as fast down a grade in a VM. 

Fun topic.
