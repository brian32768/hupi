On behalf of another Danish recumbent rider, without Internet access:

International HPV-event on Champs-Elys?es in Paris during the last week/days
of Le Tour de France 2009?

The cycling-interested press corps is already present in the city, so the
potential for press coverage is enormous!
The year 2009 sees the 75-year "anniversary" of UCI's decision to define a
bicycle in a way that excluded recumbents from racing. Why not "celebrate"
this and at the same time honour the pioneers Charles and Georges Mochet in
their home country? Draw attention to an idea that may have originated in
France, but has caught on all over the world?

The idea is to gather as many recumbents/HPVs as possible from the world
and meet in Paris in a grasshopperswarm of biblical proportions. Less is
also OK!
The French, the Parisians, the tourists, the press, will hopefully and
guided by press releases ask themselves: "These bikes that move or stand
all around town, at attractions, by cafes, everywhere - what are they? Why
are they here? During the Tour?"

He'd love to hear from people who are willing to take on the challenge:

I fully support this initiative!  Or anything to bring the accomplishments of the streamlined bicycle enthusiast community to the attention of the public.  As a fan of the tours on the media and of the HPV speed records, I applaud all efforts to advance bicycling technology for the sake of the planet.

Why not one day of unlimited time trials free of UCI bigotry in the Tours?

Stuart, et al,
Here's a way everyone can support this initiative on an ongoing basis. 
There's a local swap meet near Pittsburgh, PA coming up and I'm going to 
talk about velomobiles and streamliners.  The organizer was really excited 
about the topic - even though he's an avid transportation and racing cyclist 
nobody's told him what's going on in unrestricted cycling development.  The 
theme for my talk is going to be that racing dogma has suppressed or 
marginalized diversity and practicality of design, but now that's coming to 
an end because of the need for everyone to access sustainable 
transportation.
I would suggest to anyone who is going to be attending a bike show or 
similar event, to get on the schedule to talk about velomobiles and 
streamliners.  If you can't find 20minutes worth of fascinating stuff give 
me a call and I'll be happy to help.

Good evening,
Ben Brown pointed out that I forgot to provide the link for the bike swap in 
PA.  I could have sworn I put it there, it may have been spam-washed out. 
Here it is again in spam-invisible link. (I hope).  The page lists events in 
Maryland and Virginia too.

Again may I suggest that the focus be on an eventual acceptance into the Tours of unlimited individual time trials, one per Tour, over representative suburb to Central routes.  No rules other than no stored energy, streamlining admissible.  The advantage of such a goal is that it does not interfere with the grand and honorable tradition of the peleton, while introducing radical bicycles to the world of cycling to maximum exposure of their extreme speed and excitement.

Well, "The Grand Boucl?" as they call it yes, but my suspicion is that
the official institutions/authorities will always lag behind what's
going on in the real world - thus, the UCI will only admit recumbent
racing into their existing TdF, *after* the existing "premier
calendar", TdF, etc., have already started to become less relevant,
due to the public increasingly being exposed to recumbent racing
through other channels gradually becoming more "mainstream" and
receiving greater publicity...

TBH I'd see the two as quite different sports in many ways - the
increased effect of drafting on upright bicycles leading to the
peleton etc. making upright stage racing more tactical and interesting
from that perspective, whereas the greater speed of recumbents, in a
more time-trial-like setting, leading to a different sort of
excitement; question is, to what extent should the two be combined?
I.e. to win the TdF, would you need to be both a good (upright) stage
racer, and a good (recumbent) time triallist? The TdF winners do all
seem to be good time triallists these days (??), so....how much
crossover is there? great aerobic capacity is obviously vital for both
forms of bike, but different muscles etc. are used, so will speeds
etc. be higher if riders are allowed to specialise more (by separating
the two)?

At any rate, my feeling is that going for "official" acceptance
through the UCI is the wrong route - as Stuart (among others)
suggests, perhaps a good end goal (tho why stop there, at one TT per
tour?!), but I think the authorities are so conservative they'll never
(try to advance the sport by) incorporate recumbent racing unless it
has already become mainstream and the public are seeing it already....

My 2 cents tho (and I don't think I'm really disagreeing with what's
been said, either!)...

Cheers, Alan

Well, "The Grand Boucl?" as they call it yes, but my suspicion is that
the official institutions/authorities will always lag behind what's
going on in the real world - thus, the UCI will only admit recumbent
racing into their existing TdF, *after* the existing "premier
calendar", TdF, etc., have already started to become less relevant,
due to the public increasingly being exposed to recumbent racing
through other channels gradually becoming more "mainstream" and
receiving greater publicity...

TBH I'd see the two as quite different sports in many ways - the
increased effect of drafting on upright bicycles leading to the
peleton etc. making upright stage racing more tactical and interesting
from that perspective, whereas the greater speed of recumbents, in a
more time-trial-like setting, leading to a different sort of
excitement; question is, to what extent should the two be combined?
I.e. to win the TdF, would you need to be both a good (upright) stage
racer, and a good (recumbent) time triallist? The TdF winners do all
seem to be good time triallists these days (??), so....how much
crossover is there? great aerobic capacity is obviously vital for both
forms of bike, but different muscles etc. are used, so will speeds
etc. be higher if riders are allowed to specialise more (by separating
the two)?

At any rate, my feeling is that going for "official" acceptance
through the UCI is the wrong route - as Stuart (among others)
suggests, perhaps a good end goal (tho why stop there, at one TT per
tour?!), but I think the authorities are so conservative they'll never
(try to advance the sport by) incorporate recumbent racing unless it
has already become mainstream and the public are seeing it already....

My 2 cents tho (and I don't think I'm really disagreeing with what's
been said, either!)...

The advantage of such a goal is that it does not interfere with the grand and honorable tradition of the peleton, while introducing radical bicycles to the world of cycling to maximum exposure of their extreme speed and excitement.

No - you just start your own.  That is the freedom you have.

Mike,
The point is we haven't tried enough things under the pressure of race 
conditions to settle on a design, and the bike that performs best in race 
conditions may not do the best in the rat race.

Being a transportation cyclist I'd be more in favor of having road rallies 
and utility cycling events with lots of locations, lots of participants and 
lots of prizes (that fit the accomplishment - like a race for the groceries 
where you get groceries for a prize).

I'm not qualified to say what would happen if we tried to break in to UCI 
where we're not wanted (again).  And I'm not interested after having been in 
a couple of their silly time trials.
Nick

  Right - even the well funded Barchetta team in RAAM couldn't beat DF riders.  When it does you might have a  point.

I don't see any amazing technology in mountain bikes.  A pair of wheels with tires and maybe some suspension.
Am I missing something?

......The very beauty of recumbents is their variety. A variety to fit the various needs. Long WB, short, high, low, big wheels, small wheels....  its all so wonderful. 
Many years ago I tried re-designing a DF and found you cant do much with it. When I discovered recumbents the world of possibilities opened up to me.  
And look at the developments that have been accomplished in the recumbent world.  What was learned over the years is now applied to the Velomobile, a very important viable alternate transportation vehicle. 

Some day the public will wake up.

Allow me to preface what I have to say by stating that I ride both a recumbent and an upright, so it is reasonable to assume that I am not afflicted with platform prejudice.  Many competitive events have regulations and established participation categories.  Drag racing comes to mind.  Why some recumbent enthusiasts bemoan the fact that they are unwelcome at UCI events I find puzzling.  Shelving the rabid recumbent evangelism for a moment, the unbiased, astute recumbent enthusiast should realize why stringent,restrictive UCI regulations were put in place.  It is not a matter of unyielding prejudicial myopia or inflexible opposition to technological advances in bicycle design, but rather an attempt to equitably measure athletic performance rather than measure the merits of cutting-edge innovation in bicycle design.  UCI regulation is intended to ensure controlled measurement of the biological engine.  An open field of bicycles in an unregulated
 multiplicity of forms would serve to undermine the UCI objective.  I expect that the UCI will never to be receptive to participation of any bicycle that does not strictly conform to rigid UCI regulations.  Frankly, I wish the Tour de France organizes would invite a recumbent team with UCI blessing (temporary exemption from regulation) with the only restriction being ... no fairings.  When Team Recumbent finished dead last in the team competition and failed to win any of the individual jersey competitions, that would put an end to many a debate regarding recumbent superiority.  If the sole purpose is to raise the awareness of onlookers and demonstrate that their is an alternative to the traditional upright bicycle, a group of recumbents could ride each and every Tour de France stage before the pros do their thing.  Chances are they might even receive some TV coverage. - Jim McNamara

Since the UCI's objective its to ensure fair measurement of athletic performance, it logically follows that strict regulation of what is defined as a bicycle is a necessary requirement.  Different classes of competition would only serve to segregate rather than incorporate the recumbent into that main field which is seemingly what some recumbent enthusiasts would prefer.  Regardless, I don't realistically expect the UCI to buy off on different classes.
