this boggles the mind on what possible legal basis can the school claim the 
authority to dictate what a child can or cannot do (under a parents 
supervision even) off school grounds?

Even worse the timesunion article mentions a state trooper being there 
helping the school. Is this pure intimidation? or is there some actual 
nanny-state law that allows the school authority to take precendence above 
the parent's?

found this which has some more info:

http://www.saratogian.com/articles/2009/09/14/news/doc4aada71020507442523775.txt

apperently the school tried to enforce this by disallowing the kid to park 
his bike on school grounds (ok they can do that), and the state trooper was 
apperently there to enforce that point (after some discussion the kid locked 
his bike up off school grounds)

I'm been having trouble finding consistent reporting of the percentage 
of children who are now over-weight or obese.

The US Surgeon General's website 
http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/obesityprevention/factsheet/index.html did 
say that 17 percent of Americans between 2 - 19 years were over-weight. 
However that might have been either an out-dated figure or a simple 
mistake, an inadvertent substitution of "over-weight" for"obese". The 
New York Times (NYT) citing a Journal of the AMA article, stated the 
percentage of over-weight children was over 32 percent in 2006. 
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/health/research/28obesity.html

The rest of this post references another NYT article, found at the 
following url. 
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/fashion/13kids.html?scp=6&sq=childhood%20obesity&st=cse

The situation, of North American kids not being allowed to walk or bike, 
has gotten wacky and is not limited to Sarasota Springs, New York. I 
noticed in the pictures of the street Bill passed on, there were no 
sidewalks. No infrastructure to support bicycling or walking is not 
unusual now days in many parts of the USA.

Some select quotes follow from the NYT article titled, "Why Can't She 
Walk to School?"

."Last spring, her [ Lori Pierce, Columbus, Miss.] son, 10, announced he 
wanted to walk to soccer practice rather than be driven, a distance of 
about a mile. Several people who saw the boy walking alone called 911. A 
police officer stopped him, drove him the rest of the way and then 
reprimanded Mrs. Pierce. According to local news reports, the officer 
told Mrs. Pierce that if anything untoward had happened to the boy, she 
could have been charged with child endangerment. Many felt the officer 
acted appropriately and that Mrs. Pierce had put her child at risk. 
Critics say fears that children will be abducted by strangers are at a 
level unjustified by reality.

"About 115 children are kidnapped by strangers each year, according to 
federal statistics; 250,000 are injured in auto accidents."

[...\]

"Schools are skittish about unsupervised young walkers. Lisa Reid, who 
lives in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, had signed a 
permission form, but when her first-grader proudly told his teacher he 
was walking home himself last spring, a distance of six houses, the 
teacher was incredulous. She took him to the office and called Mrs. 
Reid, who didn?t hear the phone.

"That was because Mrs. Reid was pacing at the end of the driveway, 
waiting for her son, her worries climbing exponentially as the moments 
ticked by."

One thing that I have noticed is that firefighters (based on their custom car numberplates) are not very good at using their turn signals.  A fair percentage also talk on the phone while driving.

Scary (story) and entertaining (comments) at the same time. I think this
comment says it very well:

"jg222 wrote:
This story as well as a multitude of these comments is why Europeans laugh
at us. An utterly sad statement about transportation issues & gun access."

Well, he's right. I did break a smile at many of the comments. But then I
remembered that we're said to trail the US 5-10 years in trends -
overweight and obesity are becoming problems here now, so perhaps in the
future my children may be accused of "child endangerment" for taking their
children with them on bikes? That's ridiculous!

I would think shooting at the cyclist would endanger the child more than 
riding, but what do I know?

Motorized or non-motorized? Non-motorized push scooters should be not 
significantly different from bicycles or walking with regard to risk of 
serious injury or death.

Non-motorized. I mean these folding aluminium jobs with skate wheels. In 
comparison to most bicycles, they are shoddily built and have poor 
braking. It is easy to go faster than "safe" on steep gradients (I do so 
almost daily ;-) ). In Switzerland they are legal on sidewalks and on 
streets with little traffic. Relatively little seems to happen, 
presumably because the perception of unsaftey is higher than actual 
unsafety. The same would apply to skateboards, where in addition 
considerable skill and practise is required to use them at all.

Well, I must admit that there are parts of our area here in SW Germany 
where I would not let my kids ride a bike.  What seemed to many to be 
rational and well-planned is actually becoming car-friendly and terrible 
for bicyclists... not to mention full of overweight kids ;-)  However, 
no school I know of would even dare to tell parents how their kids can 
arrive at school.

Commonly sold and known as Razor scooters in the US (and elsewhere)? I 
used one as around campus transportation in graduate school.

I would put on inline skating wrist, elbow and knee pads and my bicycle 
foam hat before trying for downhill speed. The Razor scooters are easily 
tripped up by out of alignment sidewalk panel joints, which is one 
reason I upgraded to a Sidewalker Micro with ISO 203-mm pneumatic tires.

Indeed, scrapes and bruises are all that usually occurs in a push 
scooter accident, unless a motor vehicle is involved.

The new Autumn '09 issue of "Bicycle Quarterly" published a watts- 
meter test showing that wider, lower pressure tires were  
significantly faster than hard, narrow ones.

Have HPV riders found this out as well?

Are HPV riders using watts-meters these days?

The mag issue suggested that the upright riding, racing, and R&D  
scenes tend to be unscientific, which is why they haven't made these  
tests or discoveries themselves.

I've seen wide tires used on HPVs but they've been pumped to high  
pressure.

I suppose that soft, thin, supple, wide, low pressure tires under a  
heavy HPV rounding an off-camber corner at high speed might give  
interesting results... What kind of pressures do motorcycles use?

A way to do windless watts testing of tires and suspension losses  
might be if you set up big indoor rollers with unevennesses,  
coarsenesses and micro-bumps applied to them to simulate various  
types of asphalt. Heck you could even apply chipseal...

Of course, the wide, low-pressure approach to tires has to be paired  
with high quality and suppleness to reduce hysteresis -- losses due  
to flex.

As an aside to this discussion ... I ride a Pugsley, some:

http://lobosolo.com/fleet/SSPugs/SS%20Surly%20Pugsley04.jpg

You can dump the pressure way down on the 4" wide "Large Marge" tires, 
like 10 or 12 psi. The "annular pneumatic suspension" is very nice, but 
handling is very sketchy, with a built-in delay. Dropping the pressure 
does not seem to affect power requirements much, but I have no quant 
data to back this up.

The upside of this wide ride is that it does not tear up the turf like 
my regular MtBs. I have ridden in swampy grass areas where the bike just 
floats over the turf instead of plowing in.

Typical for motorcycles: 29psi for road and 10-15 for dirt bikes.

"Upright riding, racing and R&D" - unscientific?  I've got several books on this subject which are very scientific.  There were some results in a Swiss book I got a couple of days ago about the measurement of tire rolling resistance.  Very detailed information.

So what is the rolling resistance of this magic unnamed tire?

As it relates to real-world or racing conditions? Or steel drum

I don't recalling refering to a tire? Do you have a quote?

I mentioned the comparison of wider, softer (supple) tires to  
standard narrow hard ones.

Michelin, who know a thing or two about tires, states that optimum 
rolling resistance is achieved when the tire deflects about 15% of 
it's height under load.   The 25mm x 700 Michelin Litheons on one of 
my road bikes state that pressures should be 73psi to 102psi.  BTW A 
welcome new trend I've noticed is tires that some are actually the 
nominal size.

Stiff frames, overinflated tires and motorcycles that are jetted too 
lean all give the rider sensory input that makes him feel like he's 
going faster than he is.

Unless the rims are too narrow, my experience is that cornering is 
more secure and predictable.

Good idea, but I think you would have to use a pretty large drum to 
get accurate results.

I have 50mm Schwalbe "Big Apples" on one bike and 50mm CST Cyclops on 
another.  Same Sun Rhyno Lite rims.  Cyclops are 100 grams lighter so 
should roll as well or better at low pressures, but it's not even 
close.  I eventually settled on 35psi in the Apples and 65 in the Cyclops.

I do run high pressures on the Moulton (37-349 Bromptons) but I 
figure suspension should factor in.

You also have to factor in aero drag.  It increases logarithmically 
with increases in speed while rolling resistance is roughly 
linear.  So a wider tire may consume less total power at 15 mph but 
more at 30 mph.  Casual coast-down comparisons seem to confirm this.

Any day I can average 15 mph is a great day so I go for the wide end 
of the spectrum.

Lets see.. the times I raced (around 45 years ago) our club used  
around 20 different tyres for different weather, street, racing type  
etc conditions.
Each and any of this tyres was tested in training and specific racing  
situations. Any racer wrote down the experiences with his material  
twice a week.
This was compared to drumtests and rolling behind car tests as well as  
simple rolling down tests.
Yes, in theory the wider, softer tyre is faster. In praxis the theory  
is wrong ;-) To have the same security with a wide tyre you also need  
wider rims, that means more air resistance, turbulences, more weight.  
far less control in curves and emergency braking, more surface to pick  
up things that kills your tyre.
We only used tubulars in racing with 230 to 280 gr. Main reasons  
beside weight was the far better running flat features. Ever had a  
flat with a wide tyre on small rims while downhilling at 80 km/h  
speed? That was at the times the "wider is better" story came up first  
in the early sixties and we had to try it.
With unbelievable luck nothing on my body was broken and 2 weeks after  
I raced again.. Other racers gained more bad experiences in racing  
criterions with wider, softer tyres the idea was dead at this times.
Materials are changing and the wide tyre story came up and goes in the  
very same way as crank lenghts - in specific situations a smaller or  
wider tyre. a shorter or longer crank can be an advantage, but there  
is no generally "its better"

How can you generalize about a group of tires without knowledge of the specific
tires to base that decision on?   How magic are these tires that nobody
can name them or the method of testing?

I'm going by the uprighter's dismissal of recumbents as "dumb"  
without investigation and the huge role of trend/fad in the upright  
scene.

They can be named and their testing described.

My question stands exactly as I put it.

I think part of the problem was Jeff's use of the word "Soft".  The 
pressures that gave the best performance in each tire were what I 
consider reasonable for that tire's size.  For instance 50 psi in a 
700x35 Pasella.  The higher pressures, which gave inferior 
performance, I consider overinflation.

The 35mm Pasella has scored well in other Bicycle Quarterly tests as 
it has a supple carcass and a relatively flat profile.   However IIRC 
Heine uses 26-28mm tires for brevets as rolling resistance is just 
one part of the equation.   Weight and aero drag must also be considered.

Ah, no.

Again, I reported on a test and asked if any HPVers have tested wide,  
soft, supple tires.

The post had little to do with the test. I wondered about HPVer  
testing and experience. If you want to learn about the test, check  
the cite, and report back if you like.

All I can find listed for this issue is "Measuring suspension losses".  

I'm not sure I want to pay to find out that there are no "Rolling resistance" measurements.

Simple question - did they give a rolling resistance coefficient for a particular "smooth" road surface for a particular tire?

Thanks

Quest-riding Ian (Zzyzx on Bentrider) told me that he replaced the Big Apples with 20mm narrower Stelvios for TT riding, running at the same pressure. His times didn't improve. Bear in mind that he's TT'ing on Eastern Washington industrial strength chipseal pavement.
He said we was skeptical of testing posted on the German velomobile forum, but his experience bore this out.

Stelvio is a high pressure tire made to run best at 6-10 bar; Big  
Apples are low pressure tires made to run best at 2-5 bar. On my  
Leitra I tried Big Apples but only left the rear one  because my  
Leitra is the elder type with unsuspended rear. Using Stelvios in  
front with high pressure and the Big Apple rear at low pressure gives  
the best riding experience for this vehicle.
But of course riding the Stelvios at low pressure will not only have  
no advantage over the Big Apples, it will also ruin the tires in short  
time.

Help me out here, rocket scientists.  I seem to recall from previous  
debates something a long the lines of,  if you run a skinny tire and  
a fat tire at the same pressure, the fat tires will be over inflated  
because it has more total pressure because of the greater volume. Or  
something like that.

On the face of it, it seems like apples to apples, but it is  
apparently not..

I would think that narrow tires at 100psi would ride much the same as  
wide ones at the same pressure. The point of riding wide tires is to  
increase suspension at the most efficient location, so you ride wide  
tires at lower pressure. From another perspective, to get the same  
pinchflat protection of a narrow high pressure tire, a wide tire  
needs much less pressure. However, a caution point when using wide  
tires to reduce rolling resistance is that the tire has to be supple,  
that is, high quality. A stiff, wide tire might generate more  
hysteresis from flexing than it would save in suspension. Thick and/ 
or squirmy tread has these losses as well. Budget tires and tires  
designed for harsh conditions both tend to not roll fast. Very few  
wide tires today are made for getting lower resistance. Of course,  
wide is relative. You have to test tire and pressures on your desired  
road surface at your desire speeds to see what requires the least  
wattage...in light on wind resistance, of course. I would think that  
HPV racers would have good data of this sort.

Are HPV racers using watt-meters these days that anyone here knows of?

Word is, for instance, that UCI track racers are using 25mm tires  
these days because they're faster than 19, 20, 23...

It would be interesting if a company offered a top model in a 28 to  
test such a tire on everyday road surfaces in a faired bike where  
rolling resistance is a more apparent factor, given that wind  
resistance is reduced compared to typical UCI bikes.

I've heard about Michelin's 15% squat figure. I see that their top  
tire (Pro Race 3) has a suggested pressure range of 87-116psi in 23  
and 73-102 in 25. I suppose these figures are wide-ranging so that  
riders of various bodyweights can get the same 15% squat. However,  
I've also seen the science basis of this 15% figure challenged.

I'm mostly interested in the tire testing of faired HPV racers who  
use watt-meters. Word?

No - at 70 PSI the Big Apples are loosing their damping qualities  
leaving you with only their disadvantages - more weight, flexing, less  
good steering and bad running flat features.

If the two tires are the same diameter and at the same pressure, then the cord tension in the longitudinal direction will be the same for each; but the fat tire will have greater cord tension in the lateral direction than the skinny tire, because of its larger cross-sectional radius. The only consequences of this difference (I can think of) are that the fat tire will more vulnerable to rim blowoff or sidewall blowout; and the rolling resistance of the fat tire will not be as high as predicted from the hysteresis of its larger mass of flexing rubber. If this increase in hysteresis over the skinny tire is not significant, then the fat tire will have lower rolling resistance, other things being equal -- which they usually are not. 
 
I wish I could point you to more information about this, but I don't recall that it was ever all in one place online. Michelin and Kenda both did extensive tests, but most of the analyses were done by others -- University faculty and students, for example.

Exactly. This means that the wall thickness of the fat tire must be 
greater or it must be run at lower pressure. Or the other way around: 
very skinny tires can be run at very high pressures in spite of having 
thin walls.

In practice there are other effects. The tire must also have material to 
wear away ("tread") and a thinner tire must thus have a considerably 
greater thickness than theoretically required, or be very vulnerable and 
short-lived. I suspect that the favorable measurements of thicker tires 
have to do with this, i.e. there must be be an optimal diameter where 
the effect of extra rubber ("tread") needed is minimised, and it is 
plausible that this will be neither with the thinnest nor with the 
fattest tires.

A further effect is that so far we have been considering tubes. A 
tubular tire is a torus which is indented at the road and deformed in 
two or three dimensions (depending how you look at it) at the contact 
area. If we introduce radial belts as is often done with wider tires, it 
becomes more like a cylinder than a torus, and the deformation of the 
tread is mostly in one or two dimensions. The deformation of the side 
walls is still two or three dimensional, but here the material is 
thinner. I'm not sure what this means except that presumably such 
anisotropic tires can have lower resistance than simple tubes and that 
it is easier to engineer such tires in larger sizes.

ITEM ONE: SUSPENSION: One of the points of the testing at "Bicycle  
Quarterly" is that suspension is helpful on a bicycle and that the  
suspension which has to move the least amount of material will be the  
most efficient. So that a tire is the most efficient location to  
place suspension. Tire suspension comes from how you manage  
inflation. Suspending the wheel involves losses from moving the whole  
wheel up and down. Suspension of the rider involves losses from  
moving the whole weight of the rider. ...Something like that, anyway.

ITEM TWO: TIRE TESTS: The extensive tire-testing in the report at   
http://www.biketechreview.com/tires/images/AFM_tire_testing_rev8.pdf   
focuses on standard race tires for the most part. I see high results  
for a 27mm and 25mm tire but otherwise not much diversity in tire  
dimension. It is, however, amazing to see the variation in watts  
among 20-23mm tires!

I think the tem you're trying to find is "unsprung weight", Jeff. It's an axiom among vehicle designers that reducing unsprung weight improves efficiency, no matter how you measure it. 

I think the design of HPV's are at an interesting crossing point: on one hand, a basic unsprung upright bicycle allows the rider to use the muscles as a temporary suspension, rising off the seat and not allowing bumps to slow the vehicle. Heavier, faster recumbents benefit from suspension because the rider can't rise up off the seat, but suffer a penalty due to weight and complexity.

I'd love to see some real-world testing. Within the Schwalbe line, there's 20" and 700C tires in 28mm (Durano), 40mm (Marathon), and 50mm and 60mm (Big Apple) widths. They're not identical construction, but it's possible they're very similar. With disc brakes, these could be mounted on the same bike on appropriate width rims and swapped very easily. This would give us real data for power consumption on real roads.
