<PRE>Here are excerpts from two different studies on the subject of 
intermittent compared to continuous exercise and amount of energy 
generated (work performed). These two works are representative only. The 
subject periodically emerges in various biology and medical journals.

&quot;A practical conclusion shown by the results of the present study is 
that if the aim is to keep the physiological cost of exercise to a 
minimum, a given amount of work is better performed continuously at an 
low power output. If the aim is to stress adaptive mechanisms then 
intermittent exercise is preferable. In fact intermittent exercise in 
the form of interval training is widely used in athletics...&quot;

&quot;We can use endurance curves to make predictions about continuous 
locomotor performance. To maximize total work output (or total distance 
traveled) before exhaustion during continuous locomotion, exercise 
should be carried out at a low power output (e.g., at speeds/power 
outputs to the left of the endurance curves in Fig. 2). However, to 
maximize total work output (or distance traveled) in a given amount of 
time, exercise should be carried out at the maximum work rate (or speed) 
that can be sustained for that time period (i.e., a point on the 
endurance curve; Fig. 2). These predictions assume that work is 
performed continuously. If the work is performed intermittently, then 
predictions should address the possible advantages of recovery from 
prior activity and the potential trade-off between recovery time and 
power output.&quot;
