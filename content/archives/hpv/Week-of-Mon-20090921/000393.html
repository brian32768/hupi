<PRE>Howdy John Tetz,

Here's a earthquake shaker of a new/old thought, power endurance is 
influenced by both mental and physical state!

Science Daily provides an excellent read.

Mental Fatigue Can Affect Physical Endurance

ScienceDaily (Feb. 26, 2009) &#8212; When participants performed a mentally 
fatiguing task prior to a difficult exercise test, they reached 
exhaustion more quickly than when they did the same exercise when 
mentally rested, a new study finds.

The study also found that mental fatigue did not cause the heart or 
muscles to perform any differently. Instead, our &#8220;perceived effort&#8221; 
determines when we reach exhaustion. The researchers said the next step 
is to look at the brain to find out exactly why people with mental 
fatigue perceive exercise to be more difficult.

Samuele M. Marcora, Walter Staiano and Victoria Manning of Bangor 
University, Wales, the United Kingdom, did the study, &#8220;Mental fatigue 
impairs physical performance in humans.&#8221; The study will appear in the 
March print edition of the Journal of Applied Physiology. The American 
Physiological Society published the study.

The study

The 16 participants rode a stationary bicycle to exhaustion under two 
conditions: once when they were mentally fatigued and once when they 
were mentally rested. The trials took place in the laboratory on 
different days. The participants got the same amount of sleep, drank the 
same amount and had the same meal before each of the sessions.

The mental fatigue sessions began with a challenging 90-minute mental 
task that required close attention, memory, quick reaction and an 
ability to inhibit a response. After undergoing this session, 
participants reported being tired and lacking energy. The control 
session consisted of watching neutral documentaries for 90 minutes and 
was not mentally fatiguing.

After each of the 90-minute sessions &#8211; mentally fatiguing or 
non-fatiguing &#8211; the participants did an intense bout of exercise on a 
stationary bicycle. They rode until exhaustion, defined as the point 
when they could not maintain a cadence of at least 60 revolutions per 
minute for more than five seconds.

Throughout both exercise sessions, the researchers tracked a variety of 
physiological measures, such as oxygen consumption, heart rate, cardiac 
output, blood pressure, ventilation, and blood lactate levels. The 
participants completed surveys to measure their motivation and perceived 
effort. The researchers offered monetary prizes for the best performance 
on the exercise and mental tasks as a way to keep motivation high.

Results

The participants stopped exercising 15% earlier, on average, when they 
were mentally fatigued.

The participants stopped at the same perceived effort level in both the 
fatigued and non-fatigued trial. However, mentally fatigued participants 
started at a higher level of perceived effort and reached the endpoint 
sooner.

The cardio-respiratory and musculo-energetic measurements did not vary 
between the two trials when compared at specific points in time. 
However, because the non-fatigued trials went longer, heart rate and 
blood lactate levels were higher at the end of those trials.

Motivation was the same in both trials and was not a factor.

The researchers speculate that the perception of effort occurs in the 
brain. Dr. Marcora said his team is considering two possibilities: 
mental fatigue lowers the brain&#8217;s inhibition against quitting, or 
mentally fatigue affects dopamine, a brain chemical that plays a role in 
motivation and effort.

One interesting note is that demanding mental tasks activate the 
anterior cingulate cortex of the brain. Previous research has shown that 
rats with a lesion in the anterior cingulate cortex would not work as 
hard for a reward compared to rats with no lesion. This area of the 
brain may be where perception of effort originates, Dr. Marcora said.

Applying the results

This research could provide a way to study chronic fatigue syndrome, Dr. 
Marcora said. People with chronic fatigue report they lack energy and 
experience &#8220;brain fog,&#8221; just like the mentally fatigued participants in 
this study. In addition, as in this study, people with chronic fatigue 
perceive exercise to be more difficult despite physiological responses 
considered normal during exercise.

The research model may also be helpful for military personnel. They do 
physically demanding tasks after long period of vigilance. Vigilance 
produces mental fatigue.

Finally, the study suggests that people doing high intensity training, 
such as competitive athletes, should do their training while mentally 
rested. However, people who exercise after work should continue doing 
so, even if mentally fatigued. Most people work out at a moderate 
intensity, which still gives plenty of physiological and psychological 
benefit, including relief from stress and improved mental performance.
