<PRE>That's an interesting take, that mental stress can serve as an energy 
expenditure. Stress can influence many different aspects of the brain 
and body such as increased heart and respiration rates.  This link goes 
to an abstract
( <A HREF="http://www.springerlink.com/content/98243380047r070k/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/98243380047r070k/</A> ) about a sports 
medicine study of chess players. Chess for gosh sakes is a physical 
sport! Who'd-of-thunk? As you suggest, difficult mental tasks can 
require an increased expenditure of metabolites (energy).

Getting back to the intermittent verse continuous pedaling matter 
related to operation of a flywheel. There is a mental condition we often 
recognize as NBS (New Bicycle Syndrome. NBS refers that odd phenomena 
whereby a new bike, new gadget or technique is faster and easier to use 
than whatever it replaces. Another description of the phenomena is the 
&quot;power of expectations.&quot; Israel Urieli applied the term &quot;a priori&quot; in 
his paper in the 4th Velomobile Seminar, page 218. Recall, Izzy had been 
writing about validating the power and endurance curves in field 
conditions, and acknowledged that when the rider hit the wall (e.g., 
cycled long enough to be unable to walk) could have been  _in part_ 
having known before hand an expected distance.
