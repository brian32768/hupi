&gt;<i> The thing that I wonder in the Human Power article is the .6 horse power (447 watts) at 60 seconds and 10 seconds of recovery. That seems to be way way beyond my capabilities.   At 150 watts its starting to feel uncomfortable.

</I>I havn't seen the HP article yet, but edited a similar one in 2003:

see page 21 HP54: <A HREF="http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp54-2003.pdf">http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp54-2003.pdf</A>

The point was that one pedaller could spend a minute or so cranking up 
the flywheel, which could then operate at five times the average 
pedalling power for 15 seconds, e.g. to operate machinery which a single 
person wouldn't be able to power otherwise. This would apply to certain 
electrical tools as well, but I can't see the benefit of a &quot;large&quot; 
flywheel when charging batteries at a constant rate. There is of course 
the benefit from a &quot;small&quot; flywheel, because pedalling at constant 
torque is more difficult than pedalling at constant speed - rather like 
cycling fast is &quot;easier&quot; than exerting the same power cycling steep 
uphill (apart from the cooling of course).

However this still leaves a discrepancy. Human Power eJournal was also 
offered this article, but we returned it, as the previous one had taken 
Dave Wilson and me years to edit. There was a great deal of information, 
but we couldn't understand much of it and left this out, so in the end 
only three pages were left. I can imagine that there might be similar 
issues in the present article.
