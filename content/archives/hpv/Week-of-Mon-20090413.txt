City Room: Study Links Alcohol and Bicycle Deaths
By Jennifer 8. Lee
Tests of cyclists who died within three hours of biking accidents in New York City from 1996 to 2005 found that 21 percent had alcohol in their bodies.

So what this proves is that your 3x more likely to die within 3 hours of a cycling accident if you haven't had the health benefits of alcohol working it's wonders in your bloodstream.

Doh!

That "links" alcohol and bicycle deaths?? 
What about the 79% who had no alcohol in their (dead) bodies? 
What "links" alcohol to *their* deaths? 
This article and the study it is based upon are both worthless junk, written by worthless-junk writers.

Here's looking at you, Cornel. Eighteen people dying during a 9-year 
period, is a bit of a stretch for forming a conclusion.
 
For me, even small amounts of alcohol consumed before or during exercise 
reduce my physical ability to make a set of pedals move.  Even one weak 
beer can make the hills seem steeper and wind stronger than they really 
are. On the other hand a splash of "liquid cheering agent" after the 
last  ride of the day does okay by me. According to a recent published 
study the combination of moderate exercise with moderate alcohol 
consumption  can be a healthy choice.

 Here is a fun photo essay of graceful Amsterdam to go along with the

My own experience doing a "wine tour" of Napa Valley twenty years ago was very different : a half-glass of wine at each stop softened the saddle, smoothed the roads, and levelled the grades -- which in Napa Valley are grades indeed.

Hm, wine tours add a different perspective to the NYTimes article.  
Check out this delightful class of HPV,

pedal-powered mobile pubs for "lively" patrons.

A friend of mine is heavily into urban bikes and bike transport.  Here 
are two sites from him.

http://www.joe-bike.com/

The "Flying Pigeons" are an interesting urban concept.

http://www.larryvsharry.com/english/

The Bullitt cargo bikes.  The differences between the various models 
confuse me, but they seem serious about the concept.
