Subject: [hpv] Tom Traylor's contact info?
Message-ID: <518492C8.4080002@cs.cmu.edu>

I was interested in getting the plans for Tom Traylor's  front-drive 
bike shown at
http://traylor_fwd.home.mindspring.com/bike_plans.html

However, I found that the email address shown 
(tomtraylor at mindspring.com) doesn't work. Does anyone know if the plans 
are available, and how to contact Tom?

	Thanks, Ben
