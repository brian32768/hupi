<PRE>Isn't this similar to what the endurence electric and gas folks do with 
their machines to get more mpg or equivalent?  I have seen similar statements 
before with different time intervals of pedal vs power.  Most of report 
riding on rollers(repeating hills allows greater speed, though should have a 
higher cost because of inefficiency climbing I would think.
Interesting to consider...
I have done something similar in time trials...I thought it was bad 
conditioning and poor training and strategy when I coasted and gasped then pedalled 
again...Yes, now I can say it it is my intent;-).  You guys just need to 
give me the science now.
 
Jim, you keep that mass of yours spinning?  Mine is just molded into the 
seat...
 
Mike
