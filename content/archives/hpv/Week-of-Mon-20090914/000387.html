<PRE>The recent edition of HUMAN POWER (Number 58 Summer 2009)has an article 
&quot;Application of Human Powered Flywheel Motor as an Energy Source for 
Generation of Electrical Energy for Rural Applications, and Computer 
Aided Analysis of Battery Charging Process&quot; by Deshpande, Modak and 
Tarnekar. Based on this article and the references cited, the 
authors--most notably Modak--have done extensive research in applying 
human power to many applications, a laudable pursuit.

What puzzles me, however, is the claim that *human pedallers can produce 
five times the average power by sprinting for 60 seconds then resting 
for 15 seconds, vs. pedalling continuously.* (See p11 first paragraph.) 
Am I misinterpreting this? The references cited to back up this claim 
are mostly by the authors themselves, except for ref. 17, attributed to 
Eastman-Kodak. Some web searching turned up the the articles listed 
below among others, but in brief review, I did not find data to support 
the claim.

If there is any truth to this claim, it would dramatically change the 
way we think about and design human-powered vehicles and devices. Can 
anyone comment on this? (Are the authors listening?) I would love to see 
data supporting this.

	Thanks, Ben
