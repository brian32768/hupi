While there are questionable design choices in this demonstration bike, 
the basic process could be used to make some interesting frames, seats 
and other components that might not be economical or practical to 
construct by conventional methods.

Looking for a builder who can build me a 20 inch (406) fork.  My source is backed up with work.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!

This video is about a Human Powered Vehicle, but not the type we 
usually discuss.  However the creative thinking and the cheapness of 
the parts involved are right down our alley.

The Builder is a local mechanical engineer.  The Pilot is a 2 year 
old with Spina Bifida.  The Vehicle is simple a narrowed booster 
chair with small bike wheels and caster mounted to some aluminum 
plate or angle.  A perfect example of "The whole being greater than 
the sum of it's parts."

Even though he'll probably never walk, it's hard to feel sorry for 
Zach, watching him scoot around.   He certainly doesn't seem to feel 
sorry for himself.

Enjoy!  Zach does.

Things I noticed and thought about:

1) He definitely covers more territory in a shorter period of time than most other kids his age.  In other words, he probably wears his parents out faster!  ;-)

2) I love the way he has discovered how to manage momentum ..... coasting, hard cornering, spinning.  Someday he could be an intimidating fighter pilot!

3) Ten years from now, I expect to hear about him in the Boston Marathon  ...... taking names and whuppin' ass!

4) Did anyone else notice that he'd discovered how to carry things by stuffing them behind the "saddle horn"?  He had also figured out that those items need to be really, really stuffed down firmly!

5)  Did anyone else notice that the dog always gave him a wide birth and kept Zach in his field of vision?  Evidently the dog had learned ( through hard experience) what a speed demon Zach is!  

This video just made my day on so many levels!  Mark, have you posted this to WISIL or BROL?  It's great!

I can repost to the framebuilders list if you like ... or they're on Yahoo groups now.
