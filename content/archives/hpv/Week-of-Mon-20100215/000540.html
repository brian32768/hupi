<PRE>Nick the wife and I wear ZOX Full Face MC Helmets when on our delta tandem,
plus body armor. We want to be pretty corpses and not have to be identified
by dental records.

2 years ago my skull hit the pavement and my Giro bicycle helmet cracked
down the middle into 2 halves and the visor shattered and cut the bridge of
my beak and while I survived I had one hell of headache.  

Our delta tandem has side impact bars, lap belts and a roll bar but if we're
hit by anything like a car or truck I suspect the body armor and MC Helmets
will just make us more recognizable as humanoid and our only consolation
will be the knowledge that our trike made one heck of a big dent in whatever
hit us. 

I would not advocate MC Helmets for 2 wheel bent riders since there is a
shortage of organs for transplant but for tadpoles and deltas I would think
a MC Helmet is a must have simply because it is harder for trikes to get out
of the way of automobiles fast enough. As an added bonus a MC Helmet
deflects beer bottles.

I also know there are very few people who buy/wear motorcycle helmets for
bicycling.  Besides the fact they are heavier, the types of impacts are
different.
