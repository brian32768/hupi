<PRE>Rene,
&gt;<i>From a cyclist and riding instructor I'd like to express the consensus among 
</I>League of American Bicyclist instructors (of which I'm one).  It's a mantra 
actually - &quot;Cyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of 
vehicles.&quot;  For an urban designer this means when you design roads you 
should make them wide enough so that bicycles and other slow moving vehicles 
(Amish horsecarts, street sweepers, etc.) can be passed by faster traffic. 
The general guideline is that curb lanes should be at least 14' wide to 
permit cars to get around bikes safely.  Wider slow moving vehicles can 
still be passed, even though the passing vehicle may have to go partway into 
the oncoming lane (waiting til it's safe of course).

A contradiction in the urban design world (at least the US part of the 
world) is that designers aren't necessarily users of all types of vehicles. 
The most important thing is to get input from cyclists and cycling advocates 
at all stages of the design and feed it around to the other experts.  And 
then follow through to that oft-overlooked step - do what they suggest.

Good luck,
Nick Hein

Subject: [hpv] Information about Books on hpv + Urban Design






Hi all.

I'm studying a Master Degree on Urban Design.
My thesis will be about the relation between Human Powered Vehicles (not 
only bycicles) and the structure of the city, and what kind of structure is 
desirable in order to accommodate the hpvs in harmony with other 
transportation typical of a big city (automobiles, trains, bus, etc).

In order to begin my thesis, I need to find specialized books or papers that 
have been writen previously on that subject (i.e urban design+hpv),

If some of you have information (titles of books or papers and where they 
can be found), it will be very helpful.
