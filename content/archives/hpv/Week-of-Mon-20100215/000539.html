<PRE>Chris,
I imagine some differences would be expected when designing for a vehicle with a .2 hp motor vs. a motorcycle.  As far as I know Bell doesn't design motorcycle helmets for bicyclists - I also know there are very few people who buy/wear motorcycle helmets for bicycling.  Besides the fact they are heavier, the types of impacts are different.

The 2-piece helmets ARE amateur - they were designed by students.  These amateurs have put a lot of thought and work into their prototype.  

Anyway all I was saying to begin with is that the new design shows promise, not that it's perfect.  What's your point?
Nick

  You are kidding.  Bell designs motorcycle helmets for motorcycle racers.  I don't think they design for one hit wonders.  

  Having a helmet that is fundamentally in two pieces, like the one proposed, means that it implicitly weaker.  The ones shown looked amateur hour.  

  They were also thinner which means not as good.

  &gt; 

  &gt; Bell's knowledge of helmet design is directed toward meeting the ANSI and SNELL standards which assume a single low-speed impact typical of the type of crash beginning riders would get themselves into. Because that's what they're required to assume. A friend of mine crashed last year at relatively low speed and although the helmet protected him perfectly for the first impact, it didn't do any good for the second bounce. He was in the hospital for several weeks and unable to ride for months. 
  &gt; 
  &gt; For more advanced cyclists a motorcycle helmet design is more appropriate. Less crush, a sturdy shell that will stay together after multiple impacts, slippery enough to slide on the pavement. All I'm saying is there's room for improvement over current designs, this one makes some improvements. No helmet is perfect, only crash prevention is.

  on.
