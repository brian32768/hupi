Adding to the book ...

 

Survival trick for parked cars is seeing a driver in one, move out for two reasons, the door opener, and, the punch-it-from-a-parking-place-into-traffic, front wheels turning are clue #2.

 

Here in Phoenix, AZ, the official bike lanes leave you from a cycling lane to nothing at major intersections, with no bikie signs on where to go, there may not be any more lane going that way, there are no through bike communter ways anywhere, when the lanes stop, better have a map as everything is 7-miles away, city planning ala developer bingo.

 

Street designers and transporation engineers are not cyclists, they don't have the sense to plan the initial cut for bikes because they are not savvy to what a cyclist really needs right there at that hilltop or curve, they read about riding and a few must ride but as an engineering discipline cyclists don't exist from a viewpoint of understanding on the need for cyclists to get as much out of the downhill as possible, and to climb in the least demanding way, their minds are not used to going a max of 40-some mph down a hill if you're lucky to 6 mph climbing back up the next one.

 

So, our real needs to get from Point A to Point B are illustrated in the history of cycling in Pasadena, CA, that tore down a perfectly good cycling bridge that spanned the great arroyo the Rose Bowl was built in, with a good view of it. This was as &quot;civilization&quot; progressed and cars started to replace the bicycle which replaced the horse.

 

It's been a long battle since to give a clue from people using bikes for transportation and utility to transportation designers to make it as flat and level and the shortest distance as possible, no 1/2-mile detours, priority to hpv's, not cars, our momentum to a raging 16-mph with a full load of groceries may seem trivial, but may have taken a mile of work to attain from a full stop up that slight hill to where you were on top of it and the heart-rate steady and now we gotta' stop? 

 

Where's the hpv freeway? Society wants people to ride but doesn't have the knowledge base on cycling to get it, look at Europe and cycling, it's a heavy pro sport, the cultures there are into it more, there are more cyclists due to that. Our media kills cycling as a sport, no one knows why they maintain that bias, Lance Armstrong can't pull it here, it takes kids in grade school training to be pros, cycling is not an intuitive sport at the highest levels, teams that have been in it for decades have regimes that begin young and produce champions.

 

Here if you ride it's a toy, a status symbol or you're poor or homeless. Most people ride either because they like the freedom or can't afford any other transportation, so, the world's most used daily commuter is a bike by far, and it's the lowest priority in actual road cuts, almost every bridge cuts them out because it would have cost more to include them and not throw them in with the pedestrians where they certainly don't belong.

 

Common design practice forced by economic priorities. 

 

OK, too bad, but if drivers are educated to be fair to someone trying to sweat it out things are fine as is so I'm all for heavy spending all the time on education of drivers to have empathy for riders so when we slow them down they're patient. 

 

We get the rest, we have our ways of cheating, we jump stops signs to keep our average speed going, we can't afford two minutes of sitting around, my heart-rate drops to almost nothing by then, in 45-seconds it's down to sub 110-bpm's if I've been pushing it ... we don't just rev it up as muscle powered vehicles, it matters how long you take a break from working your heart-rate up to get somewhere how long you can sit around waiting before you have to work back up to that higher workload, cars just burn gas to get going again and don't have to worry about lactic acid or did I bring an extra goo to make it home on glycogen and not have to slow down.


Drivers are not athletes, cyclists are forced to be athletes, we are not constant output machines, our energy fades quickly and is maxed out by elite athletes at around 1,100-watts give or take, this for the best sprinters in the world taking the wind at the head of the peloton at over 40-mph, a trival speed for a car.

 

Where are the hpv monorails where riders pedal where they want to go without having to own a bike and deal with traffic?

 

Until hpv's have some design priority all you can do is put up a sign for us ... we'll dodge the cars, and, don't expect commuting by bicycle to catch on, you have to be a Cat III to deal with it, it's an athletic experience for the body to commute, you get stronger doing it, you have to eat right and sleep right just to get somewhere every workday or most. If the commute is too many miles you spend all day eating and wanting to doze off from having to recover like any pro athlete does, so, there is indeed a physical limit to how many commuter miles can be done a day by anybody without it affecting their work and home life.

 

Cycling is a complex, technical sport, to use bicycles for transportation puts athletic stress on the body like any competition training regime, it's not a passive way to get somewhere, we have no high-level priority in funding anything transportation related that to me seems to address the momentum issue for cyclists, we are thrown into the street-light systems, intersections, cross-walks ... all things that kill your speed due to a priority on who has right-of-way.

 

My practical solution for America to get pedaling is the hpv monorail for cities, our culture is not into cycling enough to make a significant difference to total transportation miles using a bike. Using the bicycle for &quot;a nice ride&quot; seems to me more important than using them for transportation in this country.

 

If you want to design and build a green way to get there, a lightweight monorail system designed just for hpv, not for general trains, it's rather cheap, doesn't have a big land footprint, can be routed for more direct lines by not having to follow streets all the time, can handle small elevation changes cheaply whereas with roads it's expensive ...

 

Seattle had a metropolitan area monorail proposed, voted in but then voted out that had a hpv monorail proposed by locals to be added, nice designs went around, a few exist around the world.
