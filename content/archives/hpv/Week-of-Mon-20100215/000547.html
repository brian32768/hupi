Those are actually heavier and hotter than a good helmet ... good helmets promote flow over the whole head, direct sweat better to handle it in most cases.

 

Even the cheap ones aren't bad this way even tho' that old one looks like it has better ventilation by the exposed area, the slot is a turbulent backflow on each side so life is complex and not as much heat gets transferred as most people would assume from the look of it, with solid areas blocking flow entirely. Against early full helmets and in the transition to them this was a good design, almost bought one but mtb'ing you want full coverage.

 

Look inside a modern one and you'll see slots for flow everywhere, that's the difference but it's all on the inside so you can't see it until the pricey versions with the largest open areas, the result in the fight for strength-vs-weight.

 

As you reduce weight for less structure it costs more, that becomes a value judgement but the wind-tunnels are pretty accurate, and flow measurements made by mfg's show better heat transfer using internal flow and let the area in open vent vary with cost.

 

Living in Phoenix my latest on-sale nice helmet was a LAS, way nice ventilation, light, easy to adjust, great in the heat, decent direction of sweat from the glasses for several styles, but pricey even on sale!!!

 

ymmv,

p.s. best helmet I've owned so far, want to try a semi-aero lightweight when this one wears out, doing OK ...
