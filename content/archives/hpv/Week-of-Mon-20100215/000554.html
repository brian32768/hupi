Before I left Toronto, it appeared to me that they were ADDING pinch  
points to otherwise very rideable secondary streets in the name of  
&quot;traffic calming&quot;. You'd be riding along in a lane that would easily  
accommodate a car and a bike, and then approach an point, often an  
intersection, where the road would be artificially narrowed and you  
would have to negotiate with the cars.
