<PRE>One corollary to the &quot;bike belong with traffic&quot; mantra that Nick 
whistles ... that few in the USA have the ganas to implement ... is that 
parked automobiles are NOT traffic and thus don't belong on streets. In 
fact, they are one of most mitigatable dangers to cyclo-commuters that I 
see, because it is counter-intuative to most drivers that traffic would 
pass their car close enough to plow into their just opened door. My late 
dermatologist, a highly educated man and a clean-water enviromentalist 
expressed his shock to me once that a cyclist had damaged the door of 
his auto. He couldn't grasp that he was the guilty party there.

Another overlooked, but simple, guideline, is to avoid pinch points, 
which throw traffic from two virtual lanes (one lane but unmarked for 
cyclist area) into one. The merge works fine if drivers are experience 
and not distracted. Huh.

Rene, as you may guess, we don't know of the books you ask for, so we 
are writing one for you, right here.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From a cyclist and riding instructor I'd like to express the consensus

</I>&gt;<i> drivers of vehicles.&quot;  For an urban designer this means when you design 
</I>&gt;<i> roads you should make them wide enough so that bicycles and other slow 
</I>&gt;<i> moving vehicles (Amish horsecarts, street sweepers, etc.) can be passed 
</I>&gt;<i> by faster traffic. The general guideline is that curb lanes should be at 
</I>&gt;<i> least 14' wide to permit cars to get around bikes safely.  Wider slow 
</I>&gt;<i> moving vehicles can still be passed, even though the passing vehicle may 
</I>&gt;<i> have to go partway into the oncoming lane (waiting til it's safe of 
</I>&gt;<i> course).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A contradiction in the urban design world (at least the US part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> world) is that designers aren't necessarily users of all types of 
</I>&gt;<i> vehicles. The most important thing is to get input from cyclists and 
</I>&gt;<i> cycling advocates at all stages of the design and feed it around to the 
</I>&gt;<i> other experts.  And then follow through to that oft-overlooked step - do 
</I>&gt;<i> what they suggest.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm studying a Master Degree on Urban Design.
</I>&gt;<i> My thesis will be about the relation between Human Powered Vehicles (not 
</I>&gt;<i> only bycicles) and the structure of the city, and what kind of structure 
</I>&gt;<i> is desirable in order to accommodate the hpvs in harmony with other 
</I>&gt;<i> transportation typical of a big city (automobiles, trains, bus, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In order to begin my thesis, I need to find specialized books or papers 
</I>&gt;<i> that have been writen previously on that subject (i.e urban design+hpv),
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If some of you have information (titles of books or papers and where 
</I>&gt;<i> they can be found), it will be very helpful.
