<PRE>Tom you have some great points. 

I would like to add some of my own. 
Because we have zero bike infrastructures I try to promote local alternate transportation for now. The 2 to 5 mile stuff for shopping and running errands. That can add up to 2500 to 3000 miles a year. Appreciable help for the environment and my health. 

And that's what most Europeans do - short haul local travel. I seldom saw a bike in between towns and cities on a couple of my European tours.  

Because I predominantly do local travel I don't get into the &quot;athletic&quot; performance area at all. At 78 those days are over. Nor do the Europeans get into athletic performance.  I do raise my heart rate, aerobic rate and get great exercise which helps lower my health care costs.  Average folks can handle this level of &quot;performance.&quot;  

 And for help in climbing I have a just a little electric help - which adds only 4.2 pounds to the vehicle. 

&gt;<i>Street designers and transporation engineers are not cyclists, 
</I>....and they don't ask cyclists for their inputs. 

&gt;<i>look at Europe and cycling, it's a heavy pro sport, 
</I>....I try to stay as far away as possible from the words cycling and sport. Here in the US that's predominantly what bikes are used for. Mention the word bike to a lay person and the first thing that comes to mind is Sport, then Kids and Toys. I have heard this innumerable times - and written in news papers.  

When I go up town in my VM someone always stops to talk to me. They like my little car. This is a step  forward in consciousness for them - car equals transportation. And that's the way I use my VM. The concept Bike limits that consciousness change. And in truth a bike is seasonably and weather limited along with poor crash protection.  

I like the idea of us writing the manuals. Most manual writers aren't even aware of VMs.
