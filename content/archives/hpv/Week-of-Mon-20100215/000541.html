<PRE>Chris,
I was only talking about this helmet, and I was only saying that I think it's got potential to be better protection than what's currently being used.  Not sure what you thought I meant beyond that, but I apologize for rattling you.

  I just don't get the &quot;this is new and revolutionary and has unquestionable benefits&quot; when it is clear that it has severe limitations.

  And why do you keep putting a downer on Bell?  They designed some of the best early bicycle helmets as against the &quot;hair net&quot; style ones which were dangerous. (Not the original leather ones but the ones with the plastic fingers).

  AFAIK the impacts are pretty similar head/ground/curb/car.

  &gt; Chris,
  &gt; I imagine some differences would be expected when designing for a vehicle with a .2 hp motor vs. a motorcycle. As far as I know Bell doesn't design motorcycle helmets for bicyclists - I also know there are very few people who buy/wear motorcycle helmets for bicycling. Besides the fact they are heavier, the types of impacts are different.
