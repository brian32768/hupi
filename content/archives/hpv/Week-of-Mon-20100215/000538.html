<PRE>Good afternoon,
In response to...
&gt;<i>I'd think I'd trust Bell's knowledge of helmet design.  I don't see a big enough crush zone on this helmet.  Decelerating the head over a shorter &gt;distance means increased g's - simple mathematics.
</I>

Bell's knowledge of helmet design is directed toward meeting the ANSI and SNELL standards which assume a single low-speed impact typical of the type of crash beginning riders would get themselves into.  Because that's what they're required to assume.  A friend of mine crashed last year at relatively low speed and although the helmet protected him perfectly for the first impact, it didn't do any good for the second bounce.  He was in the hospital for several weeks and unable to ride for months.  

For more advanced cyclists a motorcycle helmet design is more appropriate.  Less crush, a sturdy shell that will stay together after multiple impacts, slippery enough to slide on the pavement.  All I'm saying is there's room for improvement over current designs, this one makes some improvements.  No helmet is perfect, only crash prevention is.
Nick

</I>&gt;<i> Good morning,
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you may know my concern about existing helmet designs - that they are for beginner crashes, low-speed, single-impact. This new helmet design appears to address some of those concerns, making it a better choice for recumbents and streamliners.
