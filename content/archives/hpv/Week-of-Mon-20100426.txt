I don't think I've ever seen this discussed here before.  I already posted this topic once on BentRider -- but only got a few responses.  What are the advantages or disadvantages of attempting a cross country tour either supported or unsupported IF the cost was not a concern?  Obviously riding supported in a group tour has an advantage of knowing where you will end up each day and have dinner and breakfast.  And riding unsupported alone or with a couple guys allows you to plan your own agenda for food and stops.  What do you guys that have done either before think is the most enjoyable?
Thanx,

It depends how much you like people. A standard group
supported tour involves daily contact with the same 10-200
people EVERY SINGLE DAY. Route changes, detours, days off
and so on are generally not negotiable, or will require
quite a lot of discussion. A more expensive small-group
supported tour might just be you riding while your
valet-chauffeur drives the giant house-truck along behind
you and avoids all those problems. Even now and then I've
seen a couple where one drives while other rides, but that's
rare. Although I don't think I've ever seen the paid valet
option in action at all...

Unsupported touring means getting to choose how much contact
you have, based on what you feel like. Mostly, anyway -
deciding you want a sociable gathering in the middle of
Death Valley is a bit forlorn. But it also means being very
self-sufficient in many places (Death Valley, for instance
:)

Dear Recumbent Enthousiasts,

i visited spezi, and there is lots and lots of news to be written on the 
exhibition. This week some other dutch producers got some news such as 
the carbon rowing bike, that machine was not there. But there were other 
bikes, a foldable Optima Baron, a new Troytec Highracer, a Greenspeed 
Glyde etc. All stories will unfold on www.ligfiets.net during this week. 
We will work on translation into english. If someone is interested in 
doing some volutairy work on that subject feel free to contact me. We 
prefer native speakers for the translators...so native german if you 
translate into that. Translations should be made from the original in dutch.
Greetings,
Jack

I think there are a couple of questions to think about which should make the answer fairly obvious:

1) Do you want to carry your own gear?

2) Do you want to know who you riding partners ahead of time are, or are you ready to spend ~3 months riding with the same group of strangers, or would you prefer to ride solo?  

3) How do you feel about having a sag van following you across the country?

4) Are you more comfortable with a fixed/rigid agenda, or do you like to be flexible and ready to change plans to follow your whim?

I'll also add that my favorite camping spots are the ones that a group tour wouldn't find or use.  Decommissioned National Forest campgrounds, small streamside clearings, unreserveable small campgrounds and similar spots are much more enjoyable to me than loud county campgrounds which are designed for RVs.  Those camping sites aren't really available for group trips, but can be pretty easy to find when touring solo (especially on National Forest lands...so many nights on the western half of the US).

I can also understand not wanting to tour solo.  I enjoy overnight trips by myself, but don't think that I'd like anything longer.  My favorite trips are with 1 or 2 other cyclists who have a similar riding style and preferences to my own.  My tours are only a week long though, and it is easier to find someone else who can take a week off with me than someone who can take 2-3 months off.

If one is doing their first such trip, and IF money is no object, I would 
think a supported TransAm tour would be the way to go.  I had a lot of fun 
doing about 450 miles unsupported across the midwest, but multiply that 
distance by a factor of five, and the advantages in planning and security 
surely outweigh the flexibility you get by striking out on your own.  You 
still have choices among different outfits, group sizes, pace, level of 
support, etc.  Just choose carefully the tour that you think comes closest 
to matching your preferences, and enjoy!

I never did a TransAm tour -- planned it in '82, hit by a Pontiac two months before I was to depart, had to cancel -- but I've done many multiday tours, both supported and unsupported. Supported was easier and faster, unsupported was more adventure. If this is to be your first long tour, I would recommend supported.

Wally,
You've done short, supported tours before like DALMAC. Have you ever tried an unsupported tour? If you have, then just multiply some of the irritations together to anticipate the possible aggravation factor, and then check the balance versus of the adventure/do-it-yourself factors as you can envision them. 

Myself, although I loved riding DALMAC and hanging around with so many great people, I would usually choose to go it alone. I want to challenge myself and have that "alone time" that I find far too rare. That said, my past self-supported rides have been far too short (a week or less) - so there may be bigger aggravation factors I haven't encountered yet.

I plan on a 13-month "around the country in a non-linear fashion" tour to begin around Oct 1 that will be mostly self-supported, but will end with riding ROAM in Aug of 2011.

Just back from another unsupported tour, I like them for the freedom to roam, no schedule but I do find it hard to find powdered food in deli-marts so carry that stuff from home and have sent it ahead to get more on the longer tours.

 

Longest & first big tour 2,200-miles, ran out of money and had to work to get home but was hooked on it. Did many 1,200 mile tours, just back from doing three days of riding to meet a friend in Nevada and set a PR of 156-miles, from Phoenix to I-40 & US93 in one haul, tailwinds the first 70. On the way back the wind wasn't so nice, same wind, different direction for me ...

 

And, as a part of the fun, it started to rain so I got up and did another 23-miles to beat the storm to Kingman, AZ, hit by squalls a few times but the way I set up for this one I was light on weather gear so it was better for me to soak down in riding clothes than get everything damp trying to sit it out. Arrived fairly dry, on long tours I could wait it out without damping down everything by carrying two tarps (no tent, bivy & tarps are more convenient) ... then when farther up between Beatty & Tonopah, NV, the storm left me fresh snow on huge desert valleys to peaks and was nice enough to leave the road alone, awesomely beautiful touring, 40F, the squalls stayed on the peaks.

 

The hardest part is putting the wet clothes back on in the morning, you have to preserve your "drys", don't count on a laundromat, lately it's obvious most if not all of the single-store deli-mart/gas stations are out-of-business now, Goldfield, NV, has one store and one cafe left, all the public phones are removed from most of NV and those towns only support a single cell carrier, had a hard time calling people ...

 

Can't recommend this kind of touring to anyone but I have it down, only put stuff on the rear rack, no front anything because I do dirt and you crash bad in deep gravel with weight up front (first tour mistake), and that's not uncommon to run into. You need to carry a gallon of water on the bike if your stages are like out here & 70-miles between stores, on longer stages I buy #10 cans of juice & other liquids as well, you'll overnight a lot before new water, I do carry a purifier and use it to top off on some routes. No kitchen, no stove but do carry a trail cup and make coffee over stick fires in a couple of minutes.

 

My averages for mileage are way out of hand, over 100-miles/day on pavement and 50-60miles/day on dirt but these were vacations and I was getting somewhere & back, learned on this one that 172.5mm cranks are what fit me best, had to replace a set just before leaving and found that out-of-the-saddle they matche my hips way better with that little change, much easier than 175mm, less rocking is the main thing but getting the foot over the top is a lot easier now.

 

So, not only do you feel, see, smell as you ride, there's always something to learn about riding!

 

Plan your trip as best you can, have the maps you need, I use DeLorne for most things as they ground verify the roads, I copy the pages needed. Google isn't too helpful with this, and, I discovered this trip you have to use GPS in the boonies now, signage is expensive to maintain so it's gone out there at least in NV, had to bag trying for a direct route on dirt because of that on a tour I did just a month ago to the same area, Google wasn't good enough, you must have the GPS, didn't find any local maps in what stores are still open. Didn't have my GPS with me ...


Go for it, do smaller ones first to get your gear down, it never is right without doing this a few times, it's easy to get too heavy, leave-it-behind is the motto for the most fun touring, layered clothes, basic shelter gear, small repair kit & tools.

Last summer I car-tripped across the country and I noticed the death  
of the crossroads stores even in Wyoming.  Leaving Casper heading west  
(not on the freeway) my cousin told me to be sure to fill the tank  
before leaving town. It was good advice.
