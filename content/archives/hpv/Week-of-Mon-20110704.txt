This looks like it could solve the problem of bashing into things with 
the chainrings on a SWB bike or tadpole trike:

I assume it is *not* inexpensive (like all Schlumpf products), however. : (

My first thought was "like a speed drive does?" but then I see it's a copy
of the idea.

It looks as though someone has copied & hopefully refined the Schlumpf
ideas. Same concept, same shift technique, similar everything really.
Could be really useful to have a competitor in that product line, or it
could presage a lawsuit and some serious ugliness.

Since the Speed Drive is made by the same people as make this I don't
know who would be suing whom. Would this be like Coke Classic suing
Coke Zero for taste infringement? (US ad campaign from a couple years
ago).

Used to be a real pain when I lived in apartments and had to negotiate 
stairs and multiple doors with a RANS Rocket with a 62/52/39T crankset.

The other advantage of course is wider range gearing with a small 
diameter drive wheel.

People always start slowly backing away from me when I start talking  
like this ... but...

I recall a planetary BB gear system that gave you one gear when  
pedaling forward, and another when pedaling backward.  I believe there  
is a chain loop system that does the same thing. I don't care so much  
about the gear change, but it always seemed to me that being able to  
change the way one is using ones legs might provide some welcome  
variety on long rides.  On a conventional bike you can move about a  
lot more, including standing on the pedals.  Not so much on a 'bent.

In an Aquarobics class that my mom takes they have us backpedal. Try
as I might, I canna' do it. Muscle memory is quite strong. I wonder
how long it would take to re-train the legs to backpedal smoothly.
Riding my track bike I get some de-pedaling experience, but anything
but forward pedaling is tough at a high cadence.

It is difficult to do from a conventional position, but it seemed  
pretty easy for me to do in a recumbent or even CF position.  A CF  
bike might actually benefit the most.

Long time readers of HPV News may recall articles by Raymond Spinnetti  
about this subject.  He ended up backward pedaling a bike that today  
we would call a Crank Forward.

At the 2008 Interbike, Florian Schlumpf was displaying a prototype of  
the Triebwerk. As I recall it was basically a dressed up Speed Drive  
designed to compete with the SRAM-Truvativ HammerSchmidt crankset.

The chain loop system goes back well over 100 years and is called 
Retro-Direct  5-6 years ago there was a micro-mini-revival of the 
idea among tinkerers. 4 local guys built such systems but the only 
one who has stuck with it is Dave Krafft and his was the only 
recumbent.  As far as I know he's still using it regularly.

You can see his bike at 
http://mnhpva.org/Meetings/2006/feb_06/pages/03.html and on the next 
4 pages.

A few years ago someone finished PBP on a vintage Retro-Direct.

I would have thought 2 speeds inadequate for all but the fittest 
riders but now I'm getting around just fine using my Sturmey S2.

There was a prototype system being demonstrated at bike shows about 11 
years ago that allowed for pedaling both rotational directions.  When I 
briefly tried the demo (on a stand with no resistance on the rear wheel) 
there was noticeable friction in the system.  Never heard of it since then.
