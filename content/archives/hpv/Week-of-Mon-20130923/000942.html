&gt;<i> Has anyone else on this who has not ridden an upright for many years
</I>&gt;<i> tried riding an upright? How did it work out?
</I>
2 years ago I got a contract that required me to be on-premises several times a week. Their workplace is a long ride (for me--~60-70 min at an exercise pace) over OK-but-not-great, rather-congested (at least during rush hour), rolling-hills roads. Very occasionally I would ride my Stealth (which had been my exclusive ride for almost 20 years) all the way and back, but mostly my (outbound) commute was [upright ~10 min to transit stop, bus to stop nearest to workplace, upright ~10 min to workplace]. The bus bike racks do not well accommodate the Stealth (seat is too wide, 20&quot; wheel is too small for clamp), hence the upright.

Main thing I noticed about the upright was not discomfort (though I suspect that's more problematic on longer rides) but speed: the recumbent is *much* faster.

Off this thread: if anyone knows about transit providers with recumbent-friendly equipment and practices, I'd like to learn.

FWIW, Tom Roche &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/hpv">Tom_Roche at pobox.com</A>&gt;
