<PRE>&gt;<i>From doing an art frame that rode really well this is my new bike, it arrived early June and I ride these wheels in any wind conditions now as the HED has a parabolic trailing edge so lifts like a wing on the trailing half of the front wheel instead of steering you like &quot;V&quot; shapes which catch the what then is a leading edge to steer you in a crosswind. Not this one, you just lean into the a crosswind, didn't know that when I bought it but now have 1,400-miles using them all the time to where no way I'll switch back to standard wheels. The rear is a spoked wheel with a carbon cover, made for long TT's and sized to 24mm tires so I run those at 90-95psi which adds to the softer ride and rollout on rough pavement.

The details on the frame include all internal cables, faired bottle bosses and it's really a work of art as a frame for a first-off, the fairing is steel, others will be frp or carbon as it added a lot of weight, full bike is 23-lbs from 4130 straight-gage and the next will be about 21-lbs from improvements learned and the lighter fairing. I jump curbs a lot and this thing eats any terrain and always feel under control at any speed. The tall headtube is intentional to help with high-speed tracking so it's like skiing, carves turns tighter if you want and discovering that with the art frame is what cinched wanting a good one.
 
Thanks for the upgrade Brian so had to add something.
 
Cheers, stormy and wet here in Seattle,
