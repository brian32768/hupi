<PRE>Hello Michael , Tony and the HPV Bikelist:

I'm the main organizer of the San Jose Fun Day.  Next year will be our 
15th year!   Here's the answers to some of your questions.

1)  The event is always some time between mid-May and late June.   There 
are several factors involved in figuring out which date:
     a)  when the velodrome is available for us to use;
     b)   when the ASME collegiate HPV race is.  George and I mentor the 
Cal Poly ASME HPV team and we always go to that competition, which is 
held in various places sometime in late April to early May.    We have 
to have a couple of weekends between that race and ours for us and the 
Cal Poly team to recuperate. 
c)   When Mother's Day, Father's Day and Cal Poly graduation are.  I 
won't do a race on Mother's Day weekend or Cal Poly graduation weekend.  
The saturday before Father's Day is a possibility.
d)  it can't be Memorial Day weekend because the Portland HPV races are 
always that weekend.

I try to pin down the date with the velodrome association in February 
and begin letting people know and posting it on calendars by mid-March.

2)  Race advertising.   I have a long e-mail mailing list that I send 
the announcements to, and I've put both your names and e-mails on it 
now.   I also have it posted on the Recumbents.com calendar and the 
velodrome puts in on their calendar.    I used to post it on the 
IHPVA/HPVA website but last time I tried, the calendar part wasn't 
operational.  I also used to post it on the old hpv bulletin board, but 
gave up on it when we were not getting any messages from that site.  I 
don't know if we got bucked off the site at some time or if it went 
dormant for awhile.   Now that it seems to be back in operation (or we 
were put back on) I'll be posting information on next year's event 
sometime next March.   Every year I vow to put up a website about the 
event, but things keep getting in the way of learning to do web pages, 
like helping build Primal 1, and getting ready to help build Primal 2 
this summer.  Oh yeah, and work too.

I'll be posting the final results this week as an Excel spreadsheet and 
I'll see if the hpv bike list will  allow that as an attachment.

3)  History. We started putting on this event 14 years ago as a fun 
thing to do with the Cal Poly HPV team.  At the ASME collegiate races 
only a few members of the team get to actually ride in the competition.  
We wanted an event where all the team members could ride as much as 
possible.   Word went out and it has just kept going.   There are a few 
of us who have been to just about every one of them.   A lot of people 
hear about it from a friend, come to watch the first year, and come back 
to race the next year.  The racing is competitive, but we don't 
emphasize who won as much as who is having the most fun.

See you next year!
Carole Leone
