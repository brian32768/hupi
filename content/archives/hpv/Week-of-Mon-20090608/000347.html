&gt;<i> Hello Michael , Tony and the HPV Bikelist:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm the main organizer of the San Jose Fun Day.  Next year will be our 
</I>&gt;<i> 15th year!   Here's the answers to some of your questions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)  The event is always some time between mid-May and late June.   There 
</I>&gt;<i> are several factors involved in figuring out which date:
</I>&gt;<i>     a)  when the velodrome is available for us to use;
</I>&gt;<i>     b)   when the ASME collegiate HPV race is.  George and I mentor the 
</I>&gt;<i> Cal Poly ASME HPV team and we always go to that competition, which is 
</I>&gt;<i> held in various places sometime in late April to early May.    We have 
</I>&gt;<i> to have a couple of weekends between that race and ours for us and the 
</I>&gt;<i> Cal Poly team to recuperate. c)   When Mother's Day, Father's Day and 
</I>&gt;<i> Cal Poly graduation are.  I won't do a race on Mother's Day weekend or 
</I>&gt;<i> Cal Poly graduation weekend.  The saturday before Father's Day is a 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility.
</I>&gt;<i> d)  it can't be Memorial Day weekend because the Portland HPV races are 
</I>&gt;<i> always that weekend.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I try to pin down the date with the velodrome association in February 
</I>&gt;<i> and begin letting people know and posting it on calendars by mid-March.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2)  Race advertising.   I have a long e-mail mailing list that I send 
</I>&gt;<i> the announcements to, and I've put both your names and e-mails on it 
</I>&gt;<i> now.   I also have it posted on the Recumbents.com calendar and the 
</I>&gt;<i> velodrome puts in on their calendar.    I used to post it on the 
</I>&gt;<i> IHPVA/HPVA website but last time I tried, the calendar part wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> operational.  I also used to post it on the old hpv bulletin board, but 
</I>&gt;<i> gave up on it when we were not getting any messages from that site.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if we got bucked off the site at some time or if it went 
</I>&gt;<i> dormant for awhile.   Now that it seems to be back in operation (or we 
</I>&gt;<i> were put back on) I'll be posting information on next year's event 
</I>&gt;<i> sometime next March.   Every year I vow to put up a website about the 
</I>&gt;<i> event, but things keep getting in the way of learning to do web pages, 
</I>&gt;<i> like helping build Primal 1, and getting ready to help build Primal 2 
</I>&gt;<i> this summer.  Oh yeah, and work too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be posting the final results this week as an Excel spreadsheet and 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll see if the hpv bike list will  allow that as an attachment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3)  History. We started putting on this event 14 years ago as a fun 
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do with the Cal Poly HPV team.  At the ASME collegiate races 
</I>&gt;<i> only a few members of the team get to actually ride in the competition.  
</I>&gt;<i> We wanted an event where all the team members could ride as much as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible.   Word went out and it has just kept going.   There are a few 
</I>&gt;<i> of us who have been to just about every one of them.   A lot of people 
</I>&gt;<i> hear about it from a friend, come to watch the first year, and come back 
</I>&gt;<i> to race the next year.  The racing is competitive, but we don't 
</I>&gt;<i> emphasize who won as much as who is having the most fun.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See you next year!
</I>&gt;<i> Carole Leone
