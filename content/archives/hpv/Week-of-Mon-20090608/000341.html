This is the Demo   I did for those at this strictly Human Power Event of 
the drive I built for the Portland OHPV ePower event. I started out to just do 
some boundary layer control using the fan, but when I tried to improve the 
thrust to make me a bit more competitive I ended up with what you see in 
Bill's pics. The theory is based on the work of Fabio Goldschmied at NACA using 
an annular slot to pull the turbulent boundary layer in and redirect it out 
the rear thus adding &quot;negative drag&quot;(pressure thrust) in place of some of 
the form drag of a streamlined body. 

Since this only works to the extent of the existing drag, and I wanted a 
bit more boost, I began to cut the venturi tube down to get more thrust. I 
found that I still had flow into the slot as well as the more direct flow 
through a pair of NACA ducts and other openings leading to the fan. The static 
jet stream measures 35MPH(56KPH) at full thrust, but for the ePower event I 
dropped this down to about 24mph to get more time out of my batteries.
 I found that this strategy worked better than I expected. At speed the 
system seems to use less energy and the improvement it gives to my aerodynamics 
lets me go faster than the bike will without it. Bill told me that he 
sensed a slight headwind on the front straight at Portland International Raceway, 
yet I felt I could produce more speed at this part of the course. Someone 
else there might let me know if it has some downslope in that direction, 
otherwise I was getting aerodynamic improvement of one sort or the other.
 My bike sails quite well in a quartering crosswind and the filled in air 
provided by the fan could have acted somewhat like a virtual tailcone 
extension. As I had both battery and leg power left at the end of the race I 
'goosed' the throttle at the end of it.
