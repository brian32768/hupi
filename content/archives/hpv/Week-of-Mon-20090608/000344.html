</I>Hi Paul,

I'm Scott McElhiney... at Portland on Saturday afternoon you strapped 
that contraption to my GTO trike and let me buzz around the infield a 
bit.  I was wondering how the E-assist races went on Monday.  How many 
miles did you end up doing? 

For everyone else... when strapped to my trike, it didn't make enough 
power to really get me rolling, but as soon as I pushed the pedals over 
once, it just sort of floated along gathering speed slowly.  I didn't 
pedal at all as I wanted to see if it was really pushing me along.  I 
slowly picked up speed even as cornering and changing directions.  I'd 
have been curious to see how fast it would have eventually have taken me 
on a flat straight track.  It may have been acting a bit as a tailbox 
even on my trike by sucking in that turbulent air behind the seat area 
and thrusting it out.  Pretty interesting concept, although I don't 
think it could be as efficient as something mechanically driving the wheels.
