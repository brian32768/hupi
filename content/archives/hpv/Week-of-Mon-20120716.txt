Watching the Tour de France as usual, I noticed for the first time: elliptical chainrings in the last time trial, especially on the bikes of Wiggins and Froome in yesterday's time trial.  Due to my out-of-it status, I'm sure, but a na?ve question:  Does Sam Whittingham and the other Battle Mtn battlers ride with ellipticals?
