Is there anyone in the Seattle / Everett Washington area that has a Sun or 
Trice tadpole trike? I am putting the finishing touches on a new tadpole 
carrier module for our Draftmaster rack system and need to do a few final 
fit checks. If you have one and would be willing to get together with me 
please email me off-list or call me at (800) ATOC-021.

Charlie,
I just moved from Seattle -- so I can't help directly. But recommned you stop over at:

Angle Lake Cyclery
20804 International Boulevard
Seattle, WA 98198
(206) 878-7457

Dale has a wide collection of recubment trikes and the last time I was there he had both Trice and Sun tadpoles on the shop floor ready for test rides.
