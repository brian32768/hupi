According to the Surgeon General, more than 12.5 million children --  
17.1% of children and adolescents 2 to 19 years of age -- are  
overweight in the U.S., up from 13 % in 1999.

So, one would expect schools to be encouraging students to exercise  
more. Perhaps to even walk or bicycle to school. Hey, it could save  
some energy ... even reduce CO2 emissions a bit.

One would be sadly mistaken...

I'm curious as to *why* biking or walking is disallowed? I read that
article and the one in Times Union about the boy who *does* ride to school
anyway, and there's no actual reason given for the ban.

The article does say, however, that the school is situated on a rather busy
road, which may be (part of) the reason. Another part may be (and pardon my
prejudice about US society) that IF the school encouraged biking, and a
child got in an accident while doing so, the parents might sue the school
for whatever reason?

Relating to my own children's school, the school actively encourages that
children be brought to school by bike or on foot - actually any other way
than by car. The school is on a busy road (by our town's standards, anyway)
and the traffic from parents taking their children to school is (rightly)
seen as in reality endangering the school road - which is sort of a
negative spiral: parents see the traffic, think that the road is (too)
unsafe for their children to bike on, and drive them to school, increasing
the traffic, etc.
All (I think) Danish schools have school guards on nearby pedestrian
crossings, to regulate the traffic. The school guards are children from
the school, 6th grade and up. They wear reflex vests and "lollipops". We
have plenty of bike parking (although not as much as that Dutch video
showed!), and it's uncommon to have a long trip to school. The 4 miles that
the boy in the story has to ride to school would bring us to the next
town ;-)

Anyway, I agree that the schools (anywhere) should ENcourage their students
to ride (or walk) to school, and do whatever they can to make that possible
and as safe as they can. Parents should support this and accompany their
children on bikes. But traffic is never 100% safe - not even inside the
parents' cars, mind you!
The more that ride bikes (to school), the more common it gets, and the safer
it will be.

I don't see it either. Pretty shoddy journalism, IMHO.

Possibly, but note that the school is not "encouraging" biking, or is
even neutral, but actively discouraging it. I would think the most
legally defensible position would be none at all, but IANAL.

Yes, I saw that as well, but you can twist statistics a lot. Of course
there would be no bike accidents if there were no bikes ...
But if we assume that the road IS safer than comparable roads, then it
makes even less sense to discourage transport by bike. Anyway, there might
be local considerations that we can't even imagine - which is exactly why
it's such a shame that the article doesn't give a reason that students are
not allowed to bike/walk.

Behind many of these policies is usually a couple of very specific
incidents that noone wants to see repeated, ever. Better disallow any risk
of it ever happening again. Neutrality might not be an option, if the local
community (the school's "customers") demand(!) action.
Yes, my guess is a fatal (or near-fatal) accident involving a child on foot
or bike. But it's just a *guess*. Does anyone here *know*?

That is nothing short of scandalous - if it is true and if there are not 
some very special circumstances not mentioned in the article. In 
Switzerland walking and cycling to school are of course encouraged, as 
the benefits far outweigh the risks. However there is a rule for small 
children that they must walk, not cycle, unless the trip length is more 
than a specific amount. Many children also use folding mini-scooters. 
Even though one would think that these are highly dangerous, reported 
accidents are few.

In spite of this, cycling is decreasing and obesity is increasing. Also, 
many authorities engage in helmet wars, trying to make out helmetless 
people to be irresponsible. In my opinion this backfires, as many 
children will then not cycle and older ones have an extra incentive to 
switch to motor-rollers.

What I think is INTOLERABLE is a school dictating to parents the means  
that their children shall arrive at school.

It is a INTOLERABLE abuse of power.
