I've wondered how to categorize all these bikes. I feel that trikes  
will always be too heavy and thus not viable VMs... : )  No, I'm just  
being funny. I see 2-wheelers as being part of the velomobile scene.  
But maybe that's not realistic? The challenge is &quot;just&quot; in finding a  
2wheeler that's easy to start and stop. Mine was easy! So I  
considered it a VM. As you say, the 2wheelers sure seem better able  
to beat the overweight penalty. If I want 30 lbs I think I need to go  
all-carbon and 2wheel (or maybe carbon and foam and you might  
suggest). But tipovers are a drag. ...Unless you have a totally easy  
escape hatch. And don't tip over into fast traffic... Well, that's  
why my vehicle was brightly colored! But I live in a low traffic  
area. If me, as a &quot;weirdo&quot; tipped over, locals would give me a break  
since there's no congestion. This brings up the question of LANDING  
GEAR. Can landing gear be made simple, reliable and light and thus  
better than adding a third wheel? At any rate, I see 2 wheelers being  
included in the VM equation. But it does bring up the definition  
problem. What's a VM? What about the many exposed bikers ('bent and  
upright alike) with cargo, lights, fenders and rainwear and studded  
tires in winter...they say &quot;bring it on&quot; and seem to quite clearly  
use their bikes as &quot;mobiles&quot;---they replace the car with the bike,  
they use the bike as a car. I've seen partly enclosed utility bents--- 
that even had roof-sections---with easy foot-down capability---which  
would seem to meet the standard of a VM. ??
