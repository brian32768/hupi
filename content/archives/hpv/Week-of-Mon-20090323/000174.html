For long distance travel why not extend the variety of fuel sources 
consider in conjunction with regenerative abilities?  In addition to 
liquid fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel, one could explore such 
renewable sources as ethanol, methane, or plant oils.

In the proceedings of 4th Velomobile Seminar of 1999, edited by Theo 
Schmidt and Andreas Fuchs, Isreael Urieli described a bridled electric 
assist installed on a BikeE which featured a Sterling engine 
co-generator used to charge the assist's batteries. With an external 
combustion (EC) engine most anything that will burn can be used as a 
supplemental energy source, such sticks, twigs or even the fat drained 
from a pan after cooking hamburger.

One of the keys of sustainability,y as practiced by we humans before the 
Industrial Revolution,  was to keep the scale of our devices restrained 
to actual need. Dare to think small again!  When barreling down the road 
toward the end of time, slow preferable to fast.
