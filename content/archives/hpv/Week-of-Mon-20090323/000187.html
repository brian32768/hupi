<PRE> 
For one of the early IHPVA Symposiums, Dr. Alan Abbot presented a design
that he built that was a somewhat encentified version of what John Tetz
did.  In the Abbot version he set it up so that the harder that you
peddled the more power you got!  Sort of a &quot;strain gauge on the crank
connected to the throttle&quot; control system.  He indicated that this
really encouraged the rider to exercise more (a primary goal for the
pediatrician).  His implementation was admittedly not very &quot;clean&quot; (IC
chainsaw engine of the 80's) as it was just intended to be a concept
platform.  Jack Lambie had created a &quot;power assist trailer&quot; that would
give the rider the ability to &quot;unhook&quot; for local flat rides, but when
the trip had hills, would give the rider an electric assist at the touch
of a button.  His goal was something that an older rider could handle,
and not have to customize the basic bike.
