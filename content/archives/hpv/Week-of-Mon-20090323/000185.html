I have a modest streamliner body on my Rotator Tiger, seen here:

About two years ago, a medium-size dog came out at me, crossing left to
right in front of me.  I wound up T-boning him, and his momentum
pulled my front wheel right, so my bike rolled left.  I was going
15-20mph at the time.  After the collision, I thought I had rolled it,
but on more sober recollection, I think I just rolled inverted, or
very nearly so.  As I was skidding along, nearly inverted, my eyes
less than six inches from some nasty chip-seal, I remember thinking,
boy, I sure am glad I'm wearing this brain bucket.

That's nowhere near the speeds you are talking about, but still, I
stayed in my seat, and don't think a roll bar would have helped.  My
fairing and helmet took the abrasions and not me.  Afterwards, I
crawled out, righted the bike, re-seated the fairing on its
none-too-robust mount, and continued on.

Cheers,
