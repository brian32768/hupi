<PRE>&gt;<i>The notion of adequate technology for an electrical assist existing in 
</I>the here and now, which John Tetz alluded to, comes in part from the 
Chronos Hammer which appeared in 1993 
...Interesting you brought that system up. I gave a paper at the 4th Scientific Symposium in Aug of 1992 on my light weight Up Hill assist which was a IC system weighing 6 pounds 2.7 kg that I designed in 1991. 

My principles was I only needed a small amount of assistance to reduce the stress to a  rider when climbing hills.  So .2 hp from the engine combined with .1 hp from the human gave the necessary total power to climb a 6% grade around 7 mph. A decent speed yet at the same power a person would be using on flat ground. The engine was a weed wacker which I cut off a lot of unnecessary weight such as the rope starter. 

It had a single stage cog belt gear reduction to a large diameter friction drive (didn't slip in the wet nor wear out the tire) which gave a decent Rpm for the engine. Max engine rpm gave a12 mph top speed.  So by design it encouraged use only for the steeper hills but more important, intermittent use.

 Typically I could travel 1300 miles on one gallon of gas (did a lot of long distance trips in high mountain areas all over the East and West coast USA). Of course I didn't need to carry a gallon but more like 10 ounces which kept the weight of the system so low that the rider wasn't burdened by the weight on the lesser grades of 1 or 2 %. Again by encouraging intermittent operation by design.  Which also helped keep the trip pollution low. I would fill up at a gas station by giving a quick squirt and draining the hose all for 7 cents worth, give the attendant a dime and say, &quot;keep the change.&quot; Fun. 

The Chronos people were at that symposium and were trying to make a light weight E Assist of a completely different design. They redesigned and used all my ideas, with my permission, for their Hammer. I thought the name Hammer gave the wrong impression. They intended it to help a less strong rider keep up with the stronger ones on group rides.  
At that time there was no consciousness about the environment nor the use of HPV systems for local transportation. 

It didn't sell well because there was such  a negative response to ANY assist. Of course I got a lot of flack on my IC system from the purists. But I did get some very encouraging letters from HPV people scattered across the country.  The other problem was the batteries at that time were inadequate. And the losses from friction drive didn't help their efficiency. The friction loss with the IC system was insignificant in relation to the power of the IC engine.  For touring the IC was excellent - it essentially flattened the hills, such that the rider was staying in the .1 hp all the time. 

I learned a lot from that IC system and applied essentially the same principles to my present Ultra Light E Assist. in 2007.
