<PRE>This loverly old soap box is a little tippy -- very tippy -- oh well. 
The following might help to put the earlier number game in this thread 
into some context.

The notion of adequate technology for an electrical assist existing in 
the here and now, which John Tetz alluded to, comes in part from the 
Chronos Hammer which appeared in 1993 then faded from the web's lime 
light after 2000.  It was a very small unit producing 150 watts for 10 
to 15 minutes of continuous operation. The Chronos Hammer used a roller 
drive wheel,  an electric clutch (?), and  a rechargeable battery (Pb, 
NiCad or GelCell) which fit into a standard water bottle cage. The 
complete unit added 2.5 kilograms total to a bicycle once installed.  It 
cost $450 to $780 depending on options ordered.   [1]

The device operated from between 5 mph (8 km/h) and 12 mph (19 km/h) and 
best used to supply intermittent assistance during rides lasting  1 to 3 
hours. A modest speed increase during climbing can exert a significant 
influence on a cyclist's overall trip speed.

 From ENERGY AND EQUITY (1973)  by Ivan Illich, &quot;Motors can be used to 
transport the sick, the lame, the old, and the just plain lazy. Motor 
pulleys can lift people over hills, but they can do so peacefully only 
if they do not push the climber off the path. ... The time engaged in 
travel must be, as much as possible, the traveler's own: only insofar as 
motorized transport remains limited to speeds which leave it subsidiary 
to autonomous transit.... &quot; [2]
