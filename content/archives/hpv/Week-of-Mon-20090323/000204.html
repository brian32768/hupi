<PRE>As an owner of an e-assist velomobile, with the motor driving the cranks, I can say that it is probably the best method to get either top performance or top economy from an electric motor on a bike.  My velomobile was (and is, with the new owner) equipped with a Stokemonkey system. It drives the left side (via a tandem crank) of the bottom bracket with a freewheel on the motor. When the motor runs, the operator must pedal, but the operator may pedal and the motor freewheels.  Some people dislike the idea, but it worked great for me and allows for continual human assist. Clipless pedals are a must, for safety reasons.

Cyclone systems are similar, but drive the right side and have a no-pedal freewheel for those inclined to let the motor do the work.

Electric motors are most efficient in a narrow rpm range and most powerful in a slightly lower, but no less narrow rpm range. By running through the cranks, you can select the best rpm for either your climbs or duration requirements. I picked the left side gearing ratio to give me the best efficiency rpm at my mid-range to high-range cadence, and it fell into place that best power dropped into the same range as my climb cadence.

Some e-bike operators will post figures of 10-15 watt hours per mile, but one would suggest that means not quite as much pedaling as the Stokemonkey system. I never saw double digit figures and managed to bring in five to seven watt hours per mile in my velomobile. Aerodynamics played a big part in the low figures, of course.

The Stokemonkey has incredible torque and will buckle frame tubes if not well braced. Todd from clevercycles.com may not want to sell a system, for other than the Xtracycle for which it is designed, as my velomobile was an experiment that went quite well.  It's also pricey, but on a par with the BionX in my opinion.

If you have pieces and parts from another system and can engineer a Stokemonkey or Cyclone system into your bike, you'll find it rewarding in all ways.  You'll likely be able to bias the weight forward on the slippery front wheel, but put the traction to the rear where you need it.

I'm not against hub motors, but I believe that a crank-based system has so much more going for it.

Keep us updated on your project and progress.

Subject: [hpv] LWB and batteries

Since I have been diagnosed with tachycardia (occasional bursts of high heart rate) I am on beta blockers and can no longer climb the steep hills in Seattle  (BTW I highly recommend riding with a heart rate monitor.  That's the way I discovered my tachycardia).  I have been thinking about where to put an electrical assist on my bike.  I am 6 ft 3 in with big feet, so I prefer LWB bikes in order to avoid heel interference problems that I have encountered on SWBs.  So I ride an old Infinity USS LWB (Avatar type).

Where to put the electrical assist, such as a BionX.  I could put it on the 20 in front wheel, with the battery pack up front.  This might help with the main drawback of LWBs:  the poor weight distribution and the lightly loaded front wheel, which breaks free so easily.  But would I have enough traction up there to prevent slipping on a wet uphill climb (when I need it most)?

Alternatively I was thinking of building a USS LWB frame around a pedelec unit salvaged from a Giant LaFree Lite up front assisting my pedaling at the crank.  I would also mount the battery up front to help with the aforementioned weight distribution problem.  Comments?
