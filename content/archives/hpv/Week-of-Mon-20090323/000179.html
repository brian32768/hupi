Agreed, if for no other reason than that the goals are different. A
25kg cargo carrier is either misleading advertising or too lightly
built to be safe, whereas that's a reasonable goal for a velomobile
that carries one person and a lunchbox. Cargo bikes are also less
worried about wind resistance - if I'm going 15m/s on a cargo bike
I'm not pedalling and I'm usually on the brakes, whereas that would
be a nice cruising speed to a velomobile.

I have thought of adding shelter to my cargo quad, but overall I
don't think it's worth the hassle. As it is the thing is very slow
unless the route is very, very flat indeed so adding more weight and
wind resistance will just make that worse. If I was touring across
Canada on it then maybe a nose cone would make sense, but in
Australia sunblock and clothing beats trying to attach a tent.
