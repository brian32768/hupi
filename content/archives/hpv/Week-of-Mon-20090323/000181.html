<PRE>My experience is with a Versatile velomobile, which is a
fully-suspended tadpole-trike layout. I'm riding it on a 33 mile
commute in flat Orange County, California. I can forsee easy accidents
if velomobile usage breaks free from enthusiasts and infects the
general public. Can be ridden safely, but not at top speed and that's
the difference that self-regulates bicycles. You have to have
experience to ride fast and the experience means that you will ride
safer. In a velomobile a punter can push 25mph which is unsafe in
traffic and higher speeds if they have some experience. I think I hit
100kmph on the second day out of the box, in New York. Exhilarating,
sure, but a hard place to find out that your auto driving skills don't
translate.

Mr. Tetz said &quot;Crashing at 40 mph, rolling the vehicle and not getting
hurt. Cant do that on a bare bike.&quot; Probably can't do that reliably on
a velomobile, either, as you will likely be ejected.
