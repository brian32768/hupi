&gt;<i>What about the many exposed bikers ('bent and upright alike) with cargo, lights, fenders and rainwear and studded tires in winter
</I>....I applauded and admire these hardy folks. I used to do a bit myself before I learned about what's going on in the HPV world.  I have either gotten wiser in my old age or smarter in design. I'm more interested in designing for average folks - to get them out of 3,000 pound cars for their local shopping and running errands. 

I do feel some kind of enclosure is important. Visible to others specially at night, weather wise extending the riding season, and safety in crashes. 
Crashing at 40 mph, rolling the vehicle and not getting hurt. Cant do that on a bare bike. 
I do use a bare bike during a nice sunny day and have fun with it. Love the wind in my face kind of thing. But for overall use it&#8217;s the VM. 

&gt;<i>I see 2-wheelers as being part of the velomobile scene. 
</I>.....Two wheeler streamliners have been around a Long Long time. Yet they have not taken off even for the Bent crowd. I have been involved with streamers for 15 years. For a long time I wondered why. These things are exciting. Now that I have  trike based VM I know. Streamliners are dammed annoying (tension) at intersections and overall keeping them up right. Falling over happened every several months.  I fell over in front of cars waiting for a light. They patently waited while I extracted myself from the shell, and pulled the vehicle out of the way.  Not a good design feature for average folks.  I do not allow just anyone to ride my streamer. It takes a bit of pilot experience to run them. 

&gt;<i>The challenge is &quot;just&quot; in finding a 2 wheeler that's easy to start and stop. Mine was easy!
</I>........As an enthusiast yes  you can do this and do it well. No problem as they say. 

&gt;<i>So I considered it a VM.
</I>.......Definitions are there for a reason. To agree on terms so communications are efficient. You are using it as a alternate transportation vehicle which is fine. 

&gt;<i>This brings up the question of LANDING GEAR.
</I>....I looked into this too. Tricky on uneven ground. It would have to stick out far enough that crosswinds wont roll you while waiting for a traffic light.  But more its another thing to do as your coming into a intersection. Already the work load is high. If you going to make a left turn your looking for cross flow traffic from the right and left, traffic coming towards you, traffic behind, pot holes, dirt, sand, oil spill, down shifting, braking, and signaling a left turn. Whew. I don&#8217;t need to get my feet or landing gear down if I have to wait my turn. 

&gt;<i>I've seen partly enclosed utility bents---that even had roof-sections---with easy foot-down capability---which would seem to meet the standard of a VM. ??
</I>....They are good practical cargo carrying vehicles. We need more of them. This is a more grey area. I think by design meaning carrying large cargo loads they are in a category of their own. And a good one.
