.......Yes Alan was at the same symposium (Yreka Calif, 1992) and also gave a talk on his assist. He was very generous about feeling my system was quite elegant. It took many years before his system of rider amplification was applied to electric assist vehicles but are now quite popular. 

My system of using light weight minimal assist power is still being resisted by many.   

The person who helped get us accepted for submitting assist papers at that time was Paul MacCready.  Of course.
