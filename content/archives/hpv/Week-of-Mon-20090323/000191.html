</I>My faired Lightning F-40(modified) is to me a velomobile. As currently 
configured it is rather heavy at 40lbs.(18 kilograms) but If I could afford its 
carbon composite cousin, it would be in the 30 lb. (14 kilos)range. What makes it 
a Velomobile compared to its racing cousin? 

I have doors on both sides for ease of entry. It is open at the bottom so my 
feet can drop at stop signs easily, and I do not clip in to the pedals. I use 
some &quot;shoe pockets&quot; of my own design so that the street shoes I wear normally 
can be held well enough in relation to the pedals to stay attached to them 
through bumpy roads,etc. For me, I find that this system is a reasonable 
compromise for utility. The &quot;pockets&quot; provide all the tactile feedback I need to keep 
my shoes where they need to be in the pedal circle whether under power, 
coasting or backpedaling to assist my downshifts. 

I have ample room behind my seat for all the   groceries I normally buy, and 
that fits all inside the fairing so it doesn't slow me down. My speeds are 
what I might be doing if I was using   one of the current velomobile designs.

 The material I have used for this fairing modification is very rugged 
compared to the sailcloth or spandex of the F-40 and has lasted well over 10 years 
of running errands and getting excercise, including the trip across the U.S. 
that I did with it in 2000. That was an exercise I did mainly to find out the 
utility of this arrangement on an unsupported long trip. I found it to be quite 
practical and much easier than had I made the trip without the fairing. 

Refering to the original thread of Regen for E-bikes: My machine would not 
have benefitted from lightweight temporary E-assist for much of that trip, even 
though I probably could have recharged in the motel rooms I used most of the 
time. Only a few parts of the trip were in the sort of rolling hills where 
E-assist could have helped, and regen on the down hills would have been very 
dubious for those few segments unless there was a stop sign at the bottom of each 
of them. For most of the shorter hills I got my &quot;regen&quot; in the form of kinetic 
energy and aerodynamics carrying me a good way up the next hill. I suppose I 
could have used E-assist on those few steep hills that I chose to walk up, but 
overall I gained back time barrellng down the other side at 42 mph(68kph) as 
the steep slopes I found necessary to walk were often complemented by a 
shallower downslope(geologic upheaval pattern). E-assist and regen would not have 
done much good on my two all day mountain pass climbs.   I would most likely have 
run out of juice on the way up. The subsequent downhills took most of each 
next day at speeds where regen would have reduced my rollout on the flatter 
segments, and where my pedaling was both easy and too fast for E-assist.

I carried rechargeable lighting equipment that I never used because the bike 
was so fast I always got to my stopping point(even on 90+ mile days) before 
dark. E-bike legal requirements here in the U.S. would have slowed me down on 
the flats,too. I spent most of my time above the 20mph(32kph) limit.
