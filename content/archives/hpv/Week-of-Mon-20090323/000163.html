<PRE>John Tetz:
&gt;<i> My principles was I only needed a small amount of assistance to  
</I>&gt;<i> reduce the stress to a  rider when climbing hills.  So .2 hp from  
</I>&gt;<i> the engine combined with .1 hp from the human gave the necessary  
</I>&gt;<i> total power to climb a 6% grade around 7 mph.
</I>
This is the cool stuff, John!

Velomobiles bog down on uphills.

At least most of them do.

John makes really light ones.

I was thinking that a 30-lb foam or carbon velomobile might not bog  
down.

But my 60-pounder did.

Everywhere else I could roll along at 30-40mph.

If a fully-faired bike that's carrying 10-30 lbs more body or cargo  
than a bare bike could just get some help on the ups---OH AND ON THE  
STARTS FROM STOPLIGHTS---then that makes for a LOT more viable of a  
bike!

Man, batteries do seem so much better now. Maybe the time for eBikes  
is coming back!
