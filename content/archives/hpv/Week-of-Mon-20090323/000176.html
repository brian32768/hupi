<PRE>I am much in alignment with Tetz Theory of Transportation.  Not just for 
energy issues but moreso for health.   As a health care provider in the US &quot;only 
assist as needed&quot;  would be a great goal. 
I couldn't believe how sensible his solution is when he permitted me to try 
his trike in New York at the Curtiss Museum a couple years ago.  (I helped him 
improve his system...I drove it Tessla like to overload...sorry John, or your 
welcome ;-) 
Of course we have seen over time people choose much more assist than they 
need.    
 
I would like to see integrated bike hike and rail as a long term solution.  
Poor profit models for our system of business.  And too &quot;common man&quot;...I fear.
 
We have some work to do on excretions by aircraft and energy efficiency, but 
time efficiency of mid to long distance air travel is too enticing to avoid.
 
Mike
