&gt;<i> Reading some electric assist lists I found that the very same &quot;evolution&quot; from

There is an important difference in many countries: I.c. engined mopeds are 
ridden with a twist-grip throttle like a motor cycle and indees they are not 
really designed to use the pedals, even the culty Velo Solex. Most electric 
bikes are designed within Pedelec legislation, which controls the motor via a 
pedal sensor. Some bikes have both, but the twist-grip throttle doesn't allow 
full speed.

</I>&gt;<i> the assist reality? 
</I>
In my case I have never had a motor or a controller failure, but of course the 
batteries degrade. The main problems for me are purely mechanical.


&gt;<i> So the problem remains: for a short ride in the city an assist will not help me
</I>&gt;<i> to be faster &gt; in reality it will slow me down because it needs more money and
</I>&gt;<i> attention spent than an ordinary bicycle.

If you calculate this way, the only sensible vehicle is a used bike.


&gt;<i> Commuting 80-100 km I am as fast or
</I>&gt;<i> faster than a legal assist will be (25 km/h) So the real usage will be
</I>&gt;<i> intermittent for 5 to 8 km for a 100 km commute  A tiny 4-stroker, (there are
</I>&gt;<i> some built with catalyst) will do this job far better and it will be less
</I>&gt;<i> effected by extreme cold or hot weather like the e-assists.
</I>
If you need to do 80-100 km per day, indeed a John Tetz type system is required, 
or 20kg of batteries. Electric systems are not affected by the cold much 
provided you can take the batteries inside to charge. The catalysts available 
for small engines are not as effective as those used in cars, which use a 
sophisticated air-proportion regulation (lamda). As they are not mandatory, 
there is also no compulsion to service them.
