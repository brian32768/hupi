Paul, I can see from your list why you would classified your vehicle as a Velomobile. But wouldn't it better fit into a road streamliner classification? 
I think the main reason is you don't have to balance what is commonly been called a trike based Velomobile. Not having to balance to me has been the greatest benefit. It's sooooo much more relaxing when coming into a busy intersection and seeing a car coming - you simply put on the brakes and stop. None of this frantically getting the feet down in time. Another advantage is when crawling along at slow speeds such as 1 or 2 mph  - it's no problem at all to slow when climbing a steep hill or even stopping to rest and start up again.  
I also find that after running the VM for weeks at a time when I do eventually get on a bike I wobble a bit. It takes a bit of unconscious effort to balance it and kept it straight. A little bit of energy but its required all the time. I was not aware of this until riding a Velomobile. 

And during winter when riding over a patch of  black ice (specially at night) is again no big deal. I have suddenly gone down on my Orange Foam Shell a few times because of a small patch of ice or snow.
