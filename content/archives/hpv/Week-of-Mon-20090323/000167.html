<PRE>&gt;<i>Regen braking would work I think for commuting where you do a lot of stopping, 
</I>......Or going down longer grades. I have read reports from BionX owners that commute that they get enough re gen charge that they do not need to charge the batteries from a power line. 

I think the secret is to use a small amount of assist power. That way there is a better chance of getting enough energy back into the batteries to at least extend the range. To me discovering how best to do this is the advancement we need. 

&gt;<i>I see the IC engine as better for HPV assist for touring,
</I>....No question about it. Years ago I started searching for a better engine.  I found a company in Vancouver making a multi vane tiny rotary engine. Reg Technology. 
What as so enticing was it ran at around 1500 Rpm. Than meant the gear reduction would be minimal. The noise and vibration level was reported to be very low. But I believe they couldn't solve the seal wear so they are now using the system as a pump. 

&gt;<i>Until then, the IC is best even for commuting 
</I>.......HPV commuting at this stage in our car dominated, none available bike road infrastructure, would be limited to say 15 or so miles in the 20 mph range. Present E systems can quite well handle this. 

But just think of the future possibilities.
