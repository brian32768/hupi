I don't agree. Over here we still have lots of &quot;mopeds&quot; with i.c. engines. Their 
level of pollution is far greater than that of modern cars and they are also 
noisier. The only thing which is better is the CO2-level and of course batteries 
can potentially pollute heavily if not manufactured and recycled properly. You 
are right that most electrics have insufficient range for touring unless you 
have a lot of extra batteries, solar panels, or plan a lot of pub stops with 
charging your battery while eating/drinking.

</I>
I think electrics are far better for commuting as most commutes are short and 
well within the range of most electric vehicles. Here there is no need to reduce 
power the way John Tetz does from a range-perspective, although it might be 
desirable for other reasons. From my own experience electric bikes don't so much 
push up the maximum speed as the average speed. On the level I cycle only 
marginally faster using assist than without, but going uphill it doubles or 
trebles my speed.
