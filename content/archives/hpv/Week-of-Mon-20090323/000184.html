Definitely. As JW said though, the velomobile allows you to get to
much higher speeds with less effort, and that may go some way to
compensating for the increased protection.

Velomobiles also bring power assist regulations into stark relief: the
ones that specify speeds are ok, the ones that just limit power are an
invitation to disaster. Especially since there's never a requirement
that the brakes on the vehicle have to be able to dissipate more power
than the motor puts out. So you monkeys with 700W limits will be
looking at velomobiles doing 100kph or more that have little weeny
disk brakes on them and need 100m or more to stop in ideal
conditions. Over here we have similar problems but with a 200W limit
you'd need a hill as well as power assist to get to that speed.
