Yes, in the Fourth International Human Powered Vehicle Sysposium Proceedings of 
1994, pages 17-20: &quot;An experiment to encourage physical activity throught the 
use of human power amplification&quot;, right before John Tetz's article pp 21-26: 
&quot;AHPV: assisted human powered vehicle, a description&quot;.

Alan was one of the first to suggest this (he used an sensor on an idler pushing 
into the pedal chain) and maintained that the amplification &quot;reward&quot; could be 
used in any sized vehicle, his object being excercise in a motor vehicle, not so 
much assisting pedal vehicles. This work was used in the Charger electric 
bicycle marketed from California.

In Switzerland Michael Kutter developed one of the first sensor-controlled 
electric bicycles around 1992, the Velocity. He used a totally different system, 
a pedal crank speed sensor rather than a force sensor, and a mechanical system 
consisting of a planetary differential with the rear chain-cog casette on one 
side and the motor on the other side.

...
 &gt; Jack Lambie had created a &quot;power assist trailer&quot; that would
&gt;<i> give the rider the ability to &quot;unhook&quot; for local flat rides, but when
</I>&gt;<i> the trip had hills, would give the rider an electric assist at the touch
</I>&gt;<i> of a button.  His goal was something that an older rider could handle,
</I>&gt;<i> and not have to customize the basic bike.

I didn't know this, thanks, Bill. The Tour de Sol in Switzerland also featured 
one or two &quot;pushing&quot; trailers. A German whose name escapes me devised a &quot;phantom 
trailer&quot; where the hitch is a force sensor which adjusts the trailer's motor to 
simulate a &quot;massless&quot; trailer, i.e. it doesn't help, but also doesn't hinder. 
This is a concept well worth exploring.
