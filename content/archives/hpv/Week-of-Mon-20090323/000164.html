<PRE>Thanks John, nice info to know. The problem for touring with batteries is
recharging them as you ride in a way that doesn't interfere with the need
for the power.

Regen is a lot harder problem than keeping amp-hours in a battery for
lighting but it all boils down to who buys what and throw-aways are still
easier to deal with than any generator system I've used as a tourist.

I've worked on automatic systems for bikes and the latest I like the most,
Faraday would like it; wouldn't work for assist but is perfect for lighting.

Assist with batteries has always had conversion problems, from generator to
battery, from battery to motor. To store a lot of power for hills takes a
lot of power, it's really noticeable how much &quot;drag&quot; is produced even when
you're coasting when charging a system or powering the lights directly.

Regen braking would work I think for commuting where you do a lot of
stopping, but touring is different so would be harder to collect that much
power without wondering if just climbing the stupid hill is really that much
slower. 

I see the IC engine as better for HPV assist for touring, it's more
practical in all ways engineering. Our level of pollution is so small if
half the cars switched you know the result would be a drastic reduction in
pollution, so, why not use gas or diesel for its advantages in a HPV assist?

For commuting the problem of fast storage of the braking power spike and the
ability to charge a battery with that is the deal. As I found, recent
advances in understanding of how batteries accept charges will allow 10-20
second full charges to large capacity batteries, this is in the realm of
what capacitors can do so regen may become practical when these become
commercial.

Until then, the IC is best even for commuting if designed along the lines of
John's to discourage it's use by keeping the max speed down, this is a huge
insight, industrial designers take note.

&gt;<i>The notion of adequate technology for an electrical assist existing in 
</I>the here and now, which John Tetz alluded to, comes in part from the 
Chronos Hammer which appeared in 1993 
..Interesting you brought that system up. I gave a paper at the 4th
Scientific Symposium in Aug of 1992 on my light weight Up Hill assist which
was a IC system weighing 6 pounds 2.7 kg that I designed in 1991. 

My principles was I only needed a small amount of assistance to reduce the
stress to a  rider when climbing hills.  So .2 hp from the engine combined
with .1 hp from the human gave the necessary total power to climb a 6% grade
around 7 mph. A decent speed yet at the same power a person would be using
on flat ground. The engine was a weed wacker which I cut off a lot of
unnecessary weight such as the rope starter. 

It had a single stage cog belt gear reduction to a large diameter friction
drive (didn't slip in the wet nor wear out the tire) which gave a decent Rpm
for the engine. Max engine rpm gave a12 mph top speed.  So by design it
encouraged use only for the steeper hills but more important, intermittent
use.

 Typically I could travel 1300 miles on one gallon of gas (did a lot of long
distance trips in high mountain areas all over the East and West coast USA).
Of course I didn't need to carry a gallon but more like 10 ounces which kept
the weight of the system so low that the rider wasn't burdened by the weight
on the lesser grades of 1 or 2 %. Again by encouraging intermittent
operation by design.  Which also helped keep the trip pollution low. I would
fill up at a gas station by giving a quick squirt and draining the hose all
for 7 cents worth, give the attendant a dime and say, &quot;keep the change.&quot;
Fun. 

The Chronos people were at that symposium and were trying to make a light
weight E Assist of a completely different design. They redesigned and used
all my ideas, with my permission, for their Hammer. I thought the name
Hammer gave the wrong impression. They intended it to help a less strong
rider keep up with the stronger ones on group rides.  
At that time there was no consciousness about the environment nor the use of
HPV systems for local transportation. 

It didn't sell well because there was such  a negative response to ANY
assist. Of course I got a lot of flack on my IC system from the purists. But
I did get some very encouraging letters from HPV people scattered across the
country.  The other problem was the batteries at that time were inadequate.
And the losses from friction drive didn't help their efficiency. The
friction loss with the IC system was insignificant in relation to the power
of the IC engine.  For touring the IC was excellent - it essentially
flattened the hills, such that the rider was staying in the .1 hp all the
time. 

I learned a lot from that IC system and applied essentially the same
principles to my present Ultra Light E Assist. in 2007.
