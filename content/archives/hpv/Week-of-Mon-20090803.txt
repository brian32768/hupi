Hi from the Midwest Recumbent Rally at Hostel Shoppe in WI. It's been fun and interesting so far. This is the first time anyone from Atoc has made the trip from Seattle for the MRR and now I'm sorry we didn't do so sooner. 

The weather has been a bit questionable, but everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. The Friday afternoon ice cream ride was started in a light rain that got progressively worse, but at least it was warm. I personally did not pedal on Friday. I'm more of a fair weather rider, plus the folks at Hostel Shoppe were so  busy that we didn't get a Volae Expedition set up for me until later in the afternoon. 

The weather cleared up Friday evening, but over night it poured. Saturday's ride was supposed to start at 8:00 a.m. but they  imposed a 1 hour rain safety delay. Very smart move. We all rolled at 9:00 on damp roads that rapidly finished drying. It was a beautiful day in the Stevens Point area. The rest stop was at the yummy bakery in Amherst. Nice route, friendly people. Great test ride opportunities back at the Hostel Shoppe after the ride. Seminars by Rolf and Fast Freddy. Then almost as if the HS had control of the weather schedule more rain poured down at closing time.

One more ride tomorrow, Sunday, then back home. I'm looking forward to another ride on the Volae Expedition, this time with a narrow carbon seat.
