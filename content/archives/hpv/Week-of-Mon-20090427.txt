I live in Ormond Beach, Fla. just next to Daytona, the Motorcycle capital of the world, or so they say.  About a month ago during "Bike Week" I noticed a lot more trikes.  But what interested me was so many now are add-ons.  They actually have 3 wheels in the back.

 

I have 3 recumbents, a Kettwiesel, a Gold Rush and a Vision Metro.  For some time I have wanted to convert my Vision to a Trike.  However the conversion kits I found available did not provide for proper gearing.  

 

Getting older I am having more problems clicking in and then getting started again at stops.  So I though why not training wheels.  Seeing the 3 wheeled motorcycles gave me the idea to try it.

 

First I found a 2 child bike trailer for sale.  I took it and removed everything but the lower frame and wheels. I then narrowed it by three inches. Then attached it to my Metro after much thought and the help of a friend.  It took several modifications of our ideas but today after changing some shims ----- IT WORKS!!!!

 

I only road it around the block today so it has not been road tested.  It rides great going straight.  Going around corners it feels like it is going over so no fast turning.  So for $45 for the used trailer and $12 for some aluminum I have another trike .. I think.  

 

I now have to put some miles on it around the neighbor to get a final opinion or to make any modifications.  Anyway it has been fun.  I would be glad to send a picture to anyone wanting one.  I am also open to any ideas on other ways to accomplish the same thing or ideas on how to improve what I have built.

Duct tape a hamster to each of the outrigger wheel struts, then claim 
the contraption is a "miniature dual sidecar with independent auxiliary 
metabolic heating units". If your hands get cold, reach back to pet the 
appropriate left or right hamster for a few minutes. Now days, duct tape 
comes in variety of colors, as do hamsters.

An alternative vegetable approach, would be to replace the warm hamsters 
with two fresh Habanaro peppers, which are known to be especially hot.

Just guessing, it's likely not a good idea to duct tape both a hamster 
and a hot pepper simultaneously to an outrigger strut.

Mild in comparison, but infinitely more practical, would be to continue 
experimenting with the balance wheels sans exotic cargo, just like you 
are doing now. Lettuce know how the road test goes, please.

Today I road about 3 miles around the neighborhood.  It rides fine except when you want to turn.  It then becomes rather unstable and of course wants to lift the outside wheel.  So as of now it is good as long as I go straight or very slowly around corners

When I made it I narrowed the frame by 4 inches, from 32 to 28 inches.  That may be part of the problem.  I will expand it back to 32 inches.  However, I am wondering if since it has a middle drive wheel if the bike thinks the rear wheelbase is only 14 inches.  Anyone have any ideas?  Also the outboard wheels are 2 1/2 inches behind the drive wheel.  Could this contribute to the problem?

Any ideas freely  accepted. 

Thanks,

Ed Logan
