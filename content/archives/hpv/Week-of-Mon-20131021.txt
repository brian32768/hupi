Saw this recently. New bicycle wheel

and

Might do away the need for the complication and weight of suspension. ???

Might  not work on a trike with side loads. And probably the springs would wind  up on a driven wheel.

John,

I seem to recall something like this that is currently sitting on the moon.
 :-)

Remember Pantour hubs?

Triumph motorcycle once had sprung hubs.

Interesting concept, but I see a number of disadvantages compared to a 
traditional wheel and suspension:
* Requires redundant springs (not all working simultaneously)
* Heavier than traditional wheel
* Requires stiffer/stronger rim because of 3 or 4 attachment points to 
rim (rather than ~36 on standard spoked rim)
* Lateral compliance likely to compromise handling and steering
* Energy losses due to cyclic spring deflections even on smooth surfaces
* Expensive to manufacture

My question is how do you caliper brake such a wheel. Not to mention the
extra height needed in the fork to keep the tire away from the crown

My pantour front hub had the same problems.  Disk brakes removed the caliper problem.  The weight issue is unclear, but you should compare to weight of conventional wheel plus suspension.

Good question, Jeff. That also raises the issue of torque transmission 
from the hub, for the drive wheel or for hub/disk brakes. How well would 
the springs handle large torques?

 Another overly complex answer to a question of resonance.

The ordinary pneumatic bicycle tire already is a shock wheel. This mechanism and the common piston types just extend the frequency range down lower the way that sub-woofers do for audio. Its real necessity is questionable. Any bump a bicycle encounters can be finessed by rider actions if it can be reacted to in time. However, the reduced amount of extra weight and  clearances it requires may be a slight improvement to other suspension mechanisms, and of course it may be useful for some aftermarket upgrades to existing bikes for which no other suspension is possible. 

My Lightning faired recumbent benefits greatly from just the small amount of shock reduction Tim Brummer adds with his very short throw simple front suspension and it doesn't require me to give up V-brakes on the rims.  This shock wheel could do much the same, but it would need disk brakes.  I suspect that the Shock wheel may also have tire/rim separation problems with any sort of large diameter high pressure tire. It probably is running fairly low in the video. Not so much with the folding bike in the other video whose wheel width to diameter ratio allows a stiffer lateral alignment to be had with the system. That wheel will not be jumping up onto any curbs, however.

Good observations about the shock wheel. 

What I like about this HPV group is the range and depth of  knowledge and experience the members have collected over a long period of time. 

In general we also seem to have a collective opinion about environmental problems. 

We also have years of hands on experiences with HPVs. 

So I wonder if this means we could come up with a viable practical Human Powered Alternate Transportation vehicle ?

Yes, each of us have our favorite ideas, but could they be modified somewhat and joined with others to form a 21st century vehicle?

It's a bicycle. I ride a bicycle in the road, get over it.

While there are difficulties in any scheme of public road infrastructure, I found that riding a couple of hundred miles on England's secondary roads was made more tolerable because of the roundabouts that allowed all traffic to merely slow down navigate through them, bikes included. I live in 'the OC' a collection of suburban cites in the broad alluvial plain Of the Los Angeles region wedded to the American grid pattern. Except that each area of development  oriented their grid at different angles to the others, not thinking that they would ever meet at the margins. The equivalent to the roundabout here is the four-way stop, and like the roundabout, no one complete stops any sort of vehicle, but their is a lot less forgiveness in the design. It gets way out of hand when the intersection is as broad as four lanes in each direction, as some in newer areas tend to be.  Undoubtedly they were designed to have traffic lights in future with room for left and right turn pockets. They are built large enough to use a roundabout but at present they serve mainly as intimidation arenas. The few developments that have tried them, however, face criticism for doing things "differently" and causing confusion.

It is the scale of our development that gets me the most.  An alien looking down from space over southern California or many other of our rapidly expanding megalopolises  might rightly conclude that our species has a large body with between four and eighteen wheels instead of legs.

After my first ten-speed was stolen (over forty years ago) I learned to secure my bikes.

With aero wheels with bold graphics everyone sees me and better yet they let me in right away, same clothes & helmet, another unintended "feature" of owning a flashy set of wheels [they don't see the frame at first] ... drivers are in a movie, my opinion, separated from reality so to be included in the movie without trying is so right on.

Subject: [hpv] Stolen bikes, and roundabouts
Message-ID: <CAEUdCERaZRWFTzih9sdso+ZhxVPgFOkbyT9o8UsBdodSzrCUbA@mail.gmail.com>

I had my Raleigh Grand Prix stolen in 1970.  The bike boom made "ten
speeds" very saleable.

America has very erratic road design.  I live in an area of Virginia which
has had roundabouts for many decades.

A few years ago they tore one out just up the road from me, because they
put in a Mall-Wart distribution center, and I assume it was on their "must
have" list, along with the taxpayer funded well/water tower/sewage
treatment/no taxes for 20 years.

About the same time they put in roundabouts at the Charlottesville airport,
possibly to inconvenience truck bombers?
