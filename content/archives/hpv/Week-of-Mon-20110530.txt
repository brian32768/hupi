While I am planning to wax the shell (to prevent oil and other stains 
from getting into the pores in the HDPE) which means nothing will likely 
stick, that leaves the ABS "hatch" and HDPE wheel covers as places to 
put reflective material for greater nighttime visibility.  Any 
suggestions on which brand of tape is most reflective and will stick?

Would white or orange be preferable for side markings (this is for use 
in the US)?

Any ideas for the wheel discs that will look better than just slapping 
some tape on?

Why reflect when you can luminesce?

I've used both colours of retroreflective vinyl tape and white shows better. My friend "MP" tested both colours of cloth tape, and as a result used white for the AeroTrunk:

Bonjour ? tous,
L'h?licopt?re ? propulsion humaine a vol? pendant "4 ? 6 secondes".
http://www.eng.umd.edu/html/news/news_story.php?id=5726

<<A team of more than 50 students at the University of Maryland's A. James
Clark School of Engineering has succeeded in flying their human-powered
helicopter, Gamera.

Pilot Judy Wexler, a 24-year-old biology graduate student at UM, pedaled
furiously with both her hands and feet, taking the craft several inches into
the air for four to six seconds, setting a world record for human-powered
helicopter flight with a female pilot.

Kris Maynard, the judge from the National Aeronautics Association, announced
that the flight looked successful, but that official certification will
require viewing of video footage. This will likely occur on the morning of
May 13.

According to Maynard, no previous human-powered helicopter flight has been
certified. If the Gamera flight is certified, the vehicle will be the first
in history to do so.

"I am incredibly proud of this amazing feat of engineering and physical
prowess, and grateful to faculty mentors Drs. Inderjit Chopra, V.T. Nagaraj,
and J. Gordon Leishman," said Clark School Dean Darryll Pines. "Today?s
flight of Gamera is a fitting symbol of our excellence in rotorcraft
research and education, and our first step toward winning the Sikorsky
Prize.">>

On ne sait pas si leur pilote, qui a l'air tonique, s'est ?chauff?e pendant
1h30 avant la tentative, ainsi que l'aurait fait Barbara Buatois. En
regardant la vid?o, on a l'impression que la fr?quence de p?dalage est un
peu trop ?lev?e pour un mouvement bras + jambes et qu'il y a un l?ger
glissement au niveau de la trasmission ? la fin de l'extension des jambes.

Pour ceux que ?a int?ressent, le prix Sikorsky est donc toujours en jeu !

Hi Derryl,
I'd be remiss in not letting you know that we recently are "in-stock" with
the Cruzbike Quest 2.0. This is a foldable recumbent that comes either with
dual 20" or 26" wheels.

The 20" version can be packed in a Samsonite F'Lite 31" suitcase.  I'm not
aware if the other models you mention can be, or what their list price is.
The Quest is $1995.

The 2.0 comes with rear rack, elliptical chainring, and a SRAM Dual Drive II
system (internally geared hub) to provide 27 gears.

The 2.0 also has additional QR levers and thumb knobs to make take down of
the bike faster than than the 1.0 version.

It's a rugged bike with dual suspension. We are located in Lumberton, NC
right off I-95. This would be "by appointment only". No dealers in the area
have this bike in stock.

Our website is undergoing a major update, so not all of our info about this
great little bike is up-to-date.

Why does the Quest 20 use 451 mm wheels instead of the much more  
common 406 mm wheel size? There aren't many 451 mm tyres available  
and they are hard to find in most bike shops and department stores.  
406 mm has become the standard for most recumbents and folding bikes  
using "twenty inch" wheels so there is lots of tyre selection and  
availability in this size.

Since the Quest has disc brakes it seems 406 mm wheels would be an  
easy retrofit. Would you sell the Quest without wheels to people who  
want the versatility of 406 mm wheels so they can put 406 mm wheels  
on right from the start and not have surplus 451 mm wheels? Better  
yet, how about just offering it as a factory option with 406 mm  
wheels and see which version sells better.

Hi Zach,
A quick search online finds many available 451 tires, but you're right, not
as many as 406.  There's been a lot of debate over on the BROL forum about
which is better. Some people have found the 451 rolls a little faster and
smoother on bumpy roads than the 406, apparently.
http://www.bentrideronline.com/messageboard/showthread.php?t=44041&page=2
Interestingly, QBP (one of our suppliers) lists the 406 as for "BMX" and the
451 as for "recumbents". The final specs of our bikes are determined by
Cruzbike designer John Tolhurst, working with our manufacturing partners in
Taiwan. I'll pass your suggestions on to John about using 406 rims. For the
current production Quest, the wheels are packed with the bike, not sold
separately. For someone intent on using 406 rims, they could move the SRAM
Dual Drive hub (and disk brakes) over to a 406 rim as long as the rim had
the proper number of spoke holes. Thanks for your comments.
