<PRE>Chris,

I've performed real world tests with my 250 Watt Bionx with Lithium Ion batteries, but I do not have precise quantitative results.  If I only use the lowest level of assist and only on the last mile of my 6.7 mile ride to work and then use the regen setting of 2 or higher for the 4+ miles of downhill on the way home, I can ride every day without ever having to charge the battery.  In this mode, I only save about 5 minutes from my total commute time, but I am much more likely to ride knowing that I do not have to supply all the power to climb the 457 feet in the final mile to work.  Coming out of work, I can go 30 mph or better with the full regen braking on the big hill right by where I work.  On the other hills I can set the regen level to 2 and go better than 15 mph.  I do not know how the numbers in the diagnostic mode on the system correspond to standard units.  When it says my regen level is &quot;20&quot; or &quot;40&quot;, I think it is just a number on a scale that Bionx set up.  The settings on the Bionx systems can vary.  My max regen is set to &quot;45&quot;.  It can be set higher.  This is useless in flatter settings and might be overload on the system with my long 10% grade hill.  My system serves me well, but I live close to the foothills South West of Denver and ride up into the foothills to go to work.  I have a gross elevation gain of 1000 feet between home and work (a net elevation gain of 700 ft.).  For my situation, the regen works well.  I don't think it would work as well in flatter areas, but there you could go a lot further on a single charge anyway.

  I've been skimming the regen thread, but must confess that I haven't 
  read every message.

  But this leads to a simple question:

  Has anyone performed actual real-life testing of regenerative braking 
  and do they have quantitative results?

  - such as riding a specific route  with regen off, measuring the results 
  and then repeating the test with regen on ?

  I'm curious because my personal experience of  riding my non-electrified 
  recumbent through moderate hills and suburban environments is that I 
  just don't use the brakes much at all, so if I were electrified, regen 
  wouldn't provide any practical benefit.

  The theory and postulation are very interesting, but does anyone have 
  real-life numbers ?
