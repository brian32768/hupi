<PRE>Just to clarify some history, the phrase &quot;Same roads...&quot; was originally 
quoined by Jack Taylor of the Southern (USA) Bicycle League sometime in 
the mid-1990's.  This was reported to me by Fred Meredith, editor of 
Austin's Southwest Cycling News and an LAB boardmember, who met Mr. 
Taylor at an LCI seminar in Atlanta in 1996.  Mr. Meredith began to 
popularize the phrase here in Texas.  The elements of the phrase get 
rearranged quite a bit, but it all points to the same goal.

Speaking as someone who supports the notion, I'll admit that it is 
possible to juxtapose the obvious differences (between an HPV and 
gasoline engine powered vehicle) with the concept of &quot;same&quot; and produce 
some absurdities.  Let me suggest that &quot;same&quot; in this case is more of a 
shorthand for &quot;greater equality,&quot; which is meant, practically, as a 
counterweight against outright discrimination and restriction.  That is 
the background and context against which the SR^3 slogan needs to be 
understood.

A similar argument can be made for equality of the sexes in the 
workplace and society.  Yes, there are obvious differences between men 
and women, but the plodding business of social evolution and legal 
precedent is better directed by assuming &quot;sameness&quot; until some 
intractable difference gets in the way.

Diversity of traffic laws among cities and states (in the USA) makes a 
mockery of &quot;same rules.&quot;  And lingering bigotry in the minds of those 
who enforce the laws makes a mockery of &quot;same rights.&quot;  And &quot;same roads&quot; 
is a fairly depressing notion when you can picture how nice it would be 
to get away from the deadly stink-mobiles and their incompetent 
operators.  When the time comes that cyclists have the numbers to 
command a suitable chunk of infrastructure spending then we'll have 
space built to our standards, and we'll even have it without the design 
compromises that currently turn good facility designs into clumsy, 
ambiguous facility realities.  But the truth is that we are having to 
make the best of a bad situation, and that means being provisionally 
happy with something &quot;less bad,&quot; while recognizing that it is not really 
as &quot;good&quot; as what our visionaries can describe.

Keep a steady cadence...
