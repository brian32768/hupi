<PRE>The new lithiums may help this with their very fast recharge times by
allowing much higher rates of capacity to be filled before the bottom of the
hill or the end of the stop.

The success of the new hybrid cars rests on this new battery material, it's
passed the crash test without igniting so is moving through certification
for cars. 

For a regen to work I think you still need a decent capacitor bank to store
the current spike, then use that before it leaks out to charge this new
material. This seems feasible so far. Without it in braking I personally
don't think you'll have enough time to get enough of spike even with the new
material to matter much.

Read of a new combo that fully charges in 10-20 seconds, but that's much
farther from production than what I'm referring to but probably needs the
same idea with capacitors to be practical for braking but obviously way less
time to hold it before leaking out.

Frederick's observations were made on an aerodynamic vehicle ridden
repeatedly up and down a 1.5km hill at moderate speed, a test contrived to
maximize the effect of regenerative braking.  Most trips are not like this
and will not see this much energy recovery.
