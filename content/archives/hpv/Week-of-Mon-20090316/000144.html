You probably know this, but...

That's where capacitors differ from batteries.  Capacitors can be
charged and discharged at much higher rates but have lower
capacities (per weight and per volume).

Ultracapacitors are commonly referenced in electric car design
papers- they can have larger charge/discharge rates than batteries
and better store more power per weight and volume than capacitors.

I'd like that.

And if you can do that at a stop sign, you can probably to it at a
red-light or a small hill.

This guy built a 4000watt assist:

Discussion here:

  <A HREF="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/power-assist/message/72313">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/power-assist/message/72313</A>

Obviously this design is not directly good for our discussion since
it has such high gearing (i.e. poor regen) but it does demonstrate
that there it is possible to produce high power in a small package
at a low duty cycle.

Personally, I want a clutch mechanism on my as yet hypothetical
velomobile so I can pedal into the regen braking mechanism
while waiting at the red light and bank up enough energy so I can
be back at cruise speed quickly when the light goes green.
