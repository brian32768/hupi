(By the way, Tesla is an &quot;it&quot;, not a &quot;he&quot;. Nikola Tesla 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla,</A> the famous inventor from whom Tesla 
Motors <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors</A> borrowed the name, is long dead 
and has nothing to do with the Tesla cars, other than that they use AC 
(alternating current) motors rather than the DC (direct current) motors favoured 
by his rival Edison.)

But let's get away from cars and just think about acceleration. Whether bikes, 
motorcycles, cars or &quot;non-vehicular&quot; sports like skiing, there is no doubt that 
people *like* to accelerate and are prepared to pay ridiculous amounts of money 
for the priviledge.

Acceleration is available force divided by total mass (a=F/m) and available 
force is available power divided by the speed at this instant (F=P/v). Therefore 
a=P/(m*v). Examining this equation, we see that in the first instant when 
accererating from zero, very high accerations are possible with little power. It 
also helps if the mass is low and for the intitial acceleration you must have a 
great deal of force available. Now human bodies and also electric motors are 
very good at applying large forces briefly, whereas internal combustion engines 
are poor at this. For this reason, i.c. engines are always overpowered by a 
great deal, at least a factor of ten. The alternative, a quickly-acting 
wide-range CVT (continuously variable transmission) is expensive and rarely 
strong enough at the low speed end.

For the reasons above, cycles, especially very light ones, can initially 
accelerate more quickly than motor vehicles. It is this feeling which motivates 
people to spend a lot for lightweight constructions in carbon, titanium and 
magnesium. Presumably fixed-gear bikes are also gaining in popularity because 
this feeling is even more direct. Ordinary cycles suffer from having to change 
gears while accelerating just like cars. (Side note: in my opinion recumbents 
aren't as popular as racing bikes because the acceleration is the wrong way 
around: you have to push *against* the direction of motion; with a racing bike 
the direction is at least at approximately right angles; a supine vehicle would 
have it right, but is otherwise less practical.)

Electric vehicles can however get away with no mechnical gearing and electric 
motors are more powerful than either humans or combustion motors. Therefore if 
the batteries weren't so heavy, they would offer more acceleration than the 
others - and also regenerative deceleration. With advanced batteries and careful 
optimisation it is possible to get high acceleration anyway. This is probably 
what the Tesla car concept is about - a toy to compete with the other toys.

Getting back to bikes, we have several electric bikes and an electric 
motorcycle. This Peugeot ScootElec is very enjoyable to ride in urban 
conditions; it initially accelerates more quickly than similar petrol scooters 
and is better in most other respects other than range. However they don't sell 
well at all because the manufacturers prefer to advertise their petrol models 
which give them higher profits.

The vehicle I enjoy riding most is my Velocity Dolphin ebike because it combines 
all the best points described above. The moderately powered (250W) motor is 
geared through a planetary differential with the pedals in a pseudo-CVT setup 
which allows accelerating from zero to speed without changing gear. Even better, 
the pedal sensor gives a servo-feeling, so you think you are accelerating 
yourself. In effect, you are getting the performance of an athlete without being 
one and without frequent gear changes. The Dolphin unfortuantely doesn't offer 
regen braking like my wife's recumbent BionX. This also has a totally different 
pedal feeling to it. Both feelings aren't optimal, but I gather the present top 
models of Swiss ebikes (both the Dolphin successor whatever it's called and the 
Flyer) have got it about right - unfortunately without regen braking.
