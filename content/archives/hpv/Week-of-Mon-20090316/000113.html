<PRE>Thank you Mike for the background and explanation of the meaning of SR3.

SR3 seems  possibly an opposite of another slogan &quot;Copenhagenize&quot;.
 
In Copenhagen Denmark the city planners created a multi-tier 
transportation infrastructure, separate lanes and facilities for 
automobiles, bicycles, pedestrians, and rail trains. One result of this 
approach  is that now well over 30% of all personal trips in the city 
are accomplished via bike.

The average speed of the massive fleet of bikes is rather laid back, and 
easy going -- happy. Helmets seem to be something worn on the noggins of 
little kids, not adults.

&quot;Slow bicycling is a lifestyle in Copenhagen, where 500,000 people cycle 
each day to work or school. Interestingly, the average speed of this 
mass of two-wheeled humanity is 15.3 km/h. That's not decided by 
consensus or by implementation of speed limits. That is simply the 
organic speed that half a million people settle upon when given the 
chance.&quot; -- quoted from  <A HREF="http://theslowbicycle.blogspot.com/">http://theslowbicycle.blogspot.com/</A>

The blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic provides a delightful eye opening peek at 
how cycling serves as a positive part of many people's lives .

And as the cherry on top, here is the link to the Danish government's 
explanation of bicycling in Copenhagen,

Use &quot;bicycling in Copenhagen&quot; as search terms in Google to turn up a 
basket load of other fascinating web pages.

Cheers,
