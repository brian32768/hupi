I think aqatic motorists are worse than land motorists. However the conflicts 
are less because in general there is much more space.

Regarding cycling, the problem is that vehicles can have different roles 
depending on their environment and speed. A fast confident cyclist is definately 
a &quot;road vehicle&quot; while the same person can easily mingle with the pedistrians in 
a pedestrian zone by adopting a lower speed and different attitude. Non-cyclists 
don't understand this very well. They also don't understand the great 
superiority of cycles in traffic awareness and control, which allows manoeuvres 
which to non-cyclists or even casual cyclists seem foolhardy.

But of course cyclists aren't better people than motorists and don't really 
behave any better. Indeed, perhaps not having any training and less likely to 
&quot;get caught&quot; they will often behave worse. But what motorists and traffic 
planners have got to realise is that it is different if you endanger yourself 
than to if you endanger others. Cycles are much less likely to endanger others 
even when breaking various traffic laws than cars are even when obeying them.
