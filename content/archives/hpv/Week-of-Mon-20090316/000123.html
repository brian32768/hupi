I'm more interested in what it says about the charge efficiency of
the cells. Currently losses in NiMH are a major limitation on charge
rates - because you lose 20% or so of the delivered power as heat,
charging too fast melts the battery. RC models use forced air or
water bath cooling for their fast charge systems, but that's not
going to work outside those specialised environments.

So if the new cells suck up charge that fast they can't be losing
energy as heat during the process or they'd explode. It's all very
well going from 300K to 330K in a one hour charge, but if your charge
cycle is 10 seconds for the same input you'd be getting hot enough to
melt plastic (and thermal expansion alone would make cell design
tricky). So I'm guessing that means an efficiency closer to 99% than
80%. Which is great news.
