Scott, rough numbers for you:

A Prius uses about 13kWh/100km and goes about 50km on batteries
alone, so has a battery capacity of about 6500Wh. Assuming 100%
charging efficiency that's 6500WH * 3600 seconds/hour / 10 seconds,
or about 2.3MW. Your house probably has 220V AC electricity available,
so 2.3MW means about 11kA at 220V (assuming a 90% efficient charger).

Can you get 11,000 amps out of your 220V outlet?

Now, my welder can do 200A for a 10% duty cycle and the copper part of
the cables there are about 5mm diameter. 11kA is more than 50 times
that, so the cables would need to have roughly 35mm diameter copper in
them. That's 35mm diameter from the street, through your house and
into the charger for your car. A lot of copper - thousands of dollars
worth.

I know you replied to me, but I can't see anything in what you wrote
that's a response to my message. Could you clarify why you included
my message?
