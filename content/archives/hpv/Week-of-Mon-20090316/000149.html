</I>John your observation is supported by the formula for Energy.  Energy 
can be depicted most simply by Energy (E) being a Force (F) moved 
through a distance (s);

E = F * s

By reintroducing the basic depictions  for Force and acceleration ( 
F=m*a, and  a = dV/t) the Energy formula can be rewritten as;

E = m * dV/t  * s

Thus, from your example of increasing time (t) by a factor of 3, the 
amount of Energy used would be decreased to a third of what it had been. 
The value of dV in the formula need not change, hence the achieved 
maximum velocity can remain the same.

Good for you, John!!! 

Our physical and cognitive well-being depend on getting sufficient 
physical exercise.  Bicycling is not enough by itself to supply the 
needed weight bearing exercise to promote good bone density. Pedestrian 
travel supplies the most accessible weight bearing activity for most 
people and can be included as part of cycling. This can be done by 
choosing on purpose to travel over hilly routes or other otherwise 
challenging situations that will include pushing the bicycle. One can 
even consider forgoing the bike for some trips or chores.

Here are a few links about bone density and bicycling:
