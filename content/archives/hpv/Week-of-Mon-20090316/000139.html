Chris:

You must have missed the first messages in this discussion.  Theo Schmidt
and I posted URL links to accounts of regenerative braking tests conducted
by different people, using different bikes on different courses, both
anecdotal.  I've reposted this at the botttom.

In summary, the effect of regen. braking varies from zero to something in
the mid-40 percent range, depending on circumstances.  Most people who
have tried this on a typical course get something between 5 and 15%
recovery when riding normally but using the motor as a brake/generator
instead of a friction brake.

One needs to ask if increasing the mechanical complexity of the motor
system with a clutch or restricting oneself to the use of a non-geared hub
motor and of adapting one's riding style when descending hills and/or
dealing with urban traffic to minimize energy lost to air
resistance--keeping speed moderate (e.g. 15mph) so that energy can be
recaptured by the battery is a worthwhile alternative to using a similarly
larger battery?

Descending a hill at terminal velocity, braking only where necessary to
negotiate turns and other obstacles is the payback for climbing the hill
and closest one gets to (controlled) flying on a bicycle.  Efficient use
of regenerative braking would give up most of this enjoyment.

Frederick's observations were made on an aerodynamic vehicle ridden
repeatedly up and down a 1.5km hill at moderate speed, a test contrived to
maximize the effect of regenerative braking.  Most trips are not like this
and will not see this much energy recovery.
