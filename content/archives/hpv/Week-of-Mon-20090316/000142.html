<PRE>Chris said:
&gt;<i> Has anyone performed actual real-life testing of regenerative braking
</I>&gt;<i> and do they have quantitative results?
</I>
Yes, but to see it you'll need to buy the relevant back issue of A to
B. I expect that any review of the BionX will mention it, but whether
they do a decent test is anyone's guess.

BionX  ***
Estimated kit price &#163;845
The BionX is available either as a kit for fitting to a normal bike, or as a complete machine. It's the first regenerative system to become widely available, but STILL not launched in the UK, despite numerous promises, allegedly because the French Canadian manufacturer is difficult to deal with. The bike not only supplies power, but can 'recycle' it on descents and when slowing down. It relies on complex electronics to do this (which always makes us nervous), but it has many good features - near silent operation, reasonable range and reduced brake wear (the motor does most of the braking). On the negative side, range can be limited if you don't 'drive' the system carefully, and hill-climbing is not very good.
We carried out a full review of the BionX system in A to B 45, see A to B Back Numbers
