&gt;<i>(By the way, Tesla is an &quot;it&quot;, not a &quot;he&quot;.

&gt;<i>there is no doubt that people *like* to accelerate and are prepared to pay ridiculous amounts of money 
</I>for the privilege.
....yes that has been true in the past but we need to get out of that old excessive 19th and 20th century thinking. 
It's not what an individual can afford,  but what the Earth can afford. 

&gt;<i>With advanced batteries and careful 
</I>optimisation it is possible to get high acceleration anyway. 
.........Slow down that 0 to 60 in 6 seconds mentality to something like 18 seconds or higher and automatically the batteries could be smaller, the motor smaller, drive train lighter, the whole vehicle lighter, efficiency higher - now we are talking sensibly. We have adequate technology now!!!!. 

I often use my 5 pound 2.3 kg ultra light E assist on my ultra light Velomobile (47 lbs, 21kg) for &quot;adequate&quot; acceleration up to cruising speed 20 mph 32 kph. An ideal speed for HPV type vehicles.  
However when I'm using the vehicle for running local errands I often limit assist use because my bodies health depends on getting enough daily exercise. When your old you need to maintain a certain level of exercise. So using an assist for too much acceleration or in a more continuous fashion can be detrimental in many ways. We have a lot of overweight and in poor health people here in the states. 

I'm talking about local travel because here because we don't have the infrastructure for longer distance commuting. 

&gt;<i>because the acceleration is the wrong way 
</I>around: you have to push *against* the direction of motion; 
....I often eat up-rights on acceleration from a stop to 15 mph, 24kph on my unfaired FWD recumbent.  After 15 they can put out more and longer term power.
