<PRE>Following from my last message, we really want something which offers almost 
instant acceleration like in computer games, and so that we may enjoy this over 
and over, near instant deceleration and lots of stop signs!

Thus there is some rational for designing the best possible regenerative braking 
setup even though it is purely about feelings and not practical transportation. 
I believe if such vehicles could be built at affordable prices, they could 
displace quite a few car trips.

I also believe that such performance, especially when coupled to pedals, would 
allow &quot;kicks&quot; at lower speed levels and might reduce the many deaths caused by 
boy racer types with their cars.
