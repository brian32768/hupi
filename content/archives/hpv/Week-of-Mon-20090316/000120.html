<PRE>There's a recent breakthrough on LiPo batteries, enabling a battery to  
accept a massive amount of current and deliver the same.

<A HREF="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/03/lithium-breakthrough-could-charge-batteries-in-10-seconds.ars">http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/03/lithium-breakthrough-could-charge-batteries-in-10-seconds.ars</A>

Lithium breakthrough could charge (or discharge) batteries in 10 seconds

A new version of lithium battery technology can either provide a  
higher storage density than current batteries, or can charge and  
discharge as fast as a supercapacitor, emptying its entire charge in  
under 10 seconds. ...

The new work involves well-understood technology, relying on lithium  
ions as charge carriers within the battery. But the lithium resides in  
a material that was designed specifically to allow it to move through  
the battery quickly, which means charges can be shifted in and out of  
storage much more rapidly than in traditional formulations of lithium  
batteries. The net result is a battery that, given the proper  
electrodes, can perform a complete discharge in under 10 seconds&#8212;the  
sort of performance previously confined to the realm of  
supercapacitors. ....

For an eBike that just was used as an assist on hills or when starting  
out, you could use a smaller capacity (LIGHTER!) battery and have it  
accept a great deal of energy from braking.  You could also draw out a  
greater amount of current for hills.

I think this would be quite applicable to Velomobiles, with their  
great weight and lower Cd.
