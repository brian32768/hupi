A pricey speed machine isn't really what the world needs, but I expect 
that it has its place in development.

Keeping it relevant to the list, one could reasonably ask why the world 
needs racing HPVs that require a crew to get it underway.  Because it 
isn't the final product, only a necessary stage of development that has 
innate interest to those willing to invest in them.

In Tesla's case, it is a chance to fund more practical, lower 
profit-per-unit items.  Their next model, an ordinary sedan, is on the 
drawing board, but won't likely appear until business loan money comes 
back.

If you only have a small factory it makes more sense to produce a 
Ferrari than a Kia.  Small bike makers don't exactly focus on affordable 
bikes either.
