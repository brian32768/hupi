I've never seen an IHPVA practical vehicle competition, but it does seem
like a step in the right direction.  My impression is that it compares
load carrying capability and stability in difficult low-speed 
situations.  That is useful stuff, but it isn't a measure of how the 
vehicle facilitates comfortable interaction with other drivers.

Having thought about it myself, I have an idea, though it could use some 
improvement.  We face a paradox since we are using competition between 
the cyclists to hone development, but what they are being developed for 
is a cooperative enterprise.

Two or more teams of ordinary practical commuter cyclists are equipped 
by sponsors with bikes and/or gear designed for use in traffic.  The 
teams would carry the logos of their sponsors around for all to see, of 
course, and they would be clearly marked as a competitor in the event. 
The event takes place in some city, and all the sponsors contribute to 
an advertising campaign that announces that the competition will take 
place on the public streets for the next couple of months.  The teams go 
out and pursue their daily lives, and the public is encouraged to call 
in with compliments or complaints about any participating cyclist they 
encounter.  A panel of judges reviews all feedback, and awards points 
accordingly.

This makes scoring a subjective matter, much like the way a speech 
tournament is scored, which isn't good but it is the only way I've 
though of so far.  It relies on public input, and there would need to be 
some effort to curb interested parties from making false claims.  But 
this method is appropriate because the reactions of other drivers are, 
to a great degree, what good driving is about.  Of course, a complaint 
wouldn't necessarily mean bad driving, since there are cases, like a 
narrow lane, where the safest and most predictable practice will likely 
inconvenience a motorist, but that is more a matter of what expectations 
the complainer had and how realistic they are.  That is why the judges 
review feedback and assign the points.

The main effect of such a competition would be increased public 
awareness of cycling safety as a technique executed by the cyclist. 
This isn't the only facet of cycling safety (motorist behavior and 
facilities design are other factors) but it is a frequently overlooked 
one (with the non-productive exception of grouching about /really bad/ 
bicycle driving, red-light-runners, et.al., while overlooking the more 
subtle business of interacting smoothly).  It would also focus 
discussion among cyclists about what is the &quot;best way&quot; to deal with 
situations, and more detailed analysis of the situations, to avoid the 
ambiguities that cloud discussions of best practices.
