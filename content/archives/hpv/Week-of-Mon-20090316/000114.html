Yes, but they also accept charging at high rates if not already &quot;full&quot;. Unless
you start your electric bike trip at the top of a hill, there is no problem.

Most electric bikes don't have regen braking purely for cost reasons. The BionX
drive however does, and it works well. It cuts in before the mechanical brake
(you set this yourself with the placement of a magnetic sensor near one of the
brake levers) and you can also choose 4 different levels of braking from the
push-button control for longer descents (and program the controller in all sorts 
of ways).

People have reported up to 40% better range, but the main benefit would be due
to less wear on the mechanical brakes (and rims if applicable).

As people like to accelerate, they presumably would also like to brake for stop
signs - if they know that it is a well working regenerative thing - as they then
get to accelerate again.

</I>
The capacitor could absorb and supply a great deal of power for a few seconds, 
allowing very high acceleration. I don't think it would help for braking much, 
as braking power is limited by mechanical constaints (friction, center of mass).


&gt;<i> The bad news is that the energy losses
</I>&gt;<i> involved  in these schemes does not justify the extra weight.
</I>
It does if you have an electric bike in the first place. The energy density of 
batteries is higher than that of humans. The weight is however as you say 
probably not justified purely on the grounds of regeneration.
