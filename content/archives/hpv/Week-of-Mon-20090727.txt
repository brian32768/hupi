Not to be pedantic, but isn't an ebike a motor vehicle?

Quote: Unfortunately, it's deteriorated into tiny battles between members.

Fred the Tiny battles have ended after booting out 5 idiots who were doing
all the arguing and driving everyone up the wall. We however still go "off
topic" a lot but it is
Allowed as long as it returns to what the Group is all about (whatever that
is).

I created yet another Forum for people with electric bents but that Forum is
fairly inactive. Recumbents and Electric Bents have kinda hit a wall these
last couple of years and it is as if the excitement that we had back in 2001
to 2004 has gone away. Almost as if we're all waiting for something Big and
New to arrive and nothing is on the horizon.

I've been Bent for 3 decades and these last few years has seen soooo many
new models come out and there should be a lot more excitement for the newest
models and yet it has turned into a yawn fest.

I see electric motors on bents as being a necessary evil re: the aging
population no longer able to travel on human power alone and it comes down
to dumping the bent or electrifying it. Been saying for years now if your
body can deliver the watts needed to power your cranks you don't need an
e-motor but when the ability to spin is going to hell it is time to
electrify.

P.S. a question for Greenspeed AU. When you dropped BionX why didn't you
switch to the 400W eZee brushless/geared motor system with their pretty
little Li-Mn or Li-Polymer pack?

I've been a member of the e-assist group on Yahoo, back when it contained
useful information and intelligent discussion. Unfortunately, it's
deterioriated into tiny battles between members. I'm also a member of a
number of electric vehicle groups and lists.  The discussion of Lithium
shortage pops up now and then, but it usually fades away. One post suggested
that Lithium is quite plentiful and a Google search will return a
fifty-fifty match of shortage/plentiful posts.

The China article is hopeful for the world, since the riders are choosing to
not buy motor vehicles.  The limits are quite severe compared to those of
many states in the USA. 12 mph max speed isn't very good and the weight of
the vehicle is quite low as well.  Florida requires that the bicycle retain
pedals, and that it cannot exceed 20 mph with a 170 pound rider on board, on
flat ground, no human power applied. Luckily, both Florida and Texas have no
other restrictions, so if you have an assist bike that will do 20 mph and
then go faster with human bean tossed in, you can go faster-er.

My AAW velomobile (now sold) has a Stokemonkey installed, from CleverCycles,
which runs through the left side crank, and therefore through the gears,
allowing best efficiency and power when used properly. I was able to run 37
mph on flat ground and full human bean, but only for a short time.  Loads of
fun, especially since the Stokemonkey requires that one pedal when the motor
is engaged. Any other implementation just felt wrong.

The answer to that question is both yes and no. As an example, a common 
garden tomato can be defined by law as a vegetable in one place and  in 
another place, can be considered a fruit. What is regarded as a bicycle 
in one country can be regulated as a motor vehicle elsewhere.

Right, but Fred's original comment didn't seem to be based on the
legal definition.

I can think of several reasons why choosing an ebike might be more
hopeful than, perhaps, choosing a four-door sedan, even if they're
both vehicles with motors.

......I feel if the rider has to still pedal along with the assist then its an assisted vehicle.  If the vehicle can be propelled completely by the motor then its a motor vehicle. 

For instance my 100 watt system (input to the motor - 50ish watts to the road) basically cant power the vehicle by itself. So this is definitely.

My system would not need to be licensed.

In Ohio, I believe the vehicle only doesn't have to be licensed unless under
its own power it can go faster than (I believe) 29 mph, or if it has an
external power source and has four wheels. The speed there may be wrong, but
that's how the requirements work, anyhow.

The estimate of 35 million tons of recoverable lithium on the planet amounts to more than 5kg per capita, which oughtta be adequate unless we use it all for mood-stabilisation or for nuke-yuler weapons.

Actually even if it's used for stabilizing manic depressives, that
becomes recoverable from the sewage, given the right technology.
Elemental lithium can't be destroyed except in a nuclear reaction like
a fusion bomb.

The problem then becomes one of getting a bunch of manic-depressives to develop the right technology.

Good evening,
I wanted to pass this along even though the entry deadline is tomorrow (sorry, I just found out about it myself)...

OREGON MANIFEST CONSTRUCTOR?S DESIGN CHALLENGE
Frame builders from around the country are challenged to design and build an innovative, modern transportation bike in this technical trial of engineering dexterity and fabrication mettle. Considered, integrated, and spectacular solutions for the everyday rider will be explored and exhibited before the public.

More at:  http://www.oregonmanifest.com/

Good luck, I'm on vacation and there's no way I'll get an entry fee together by then.
