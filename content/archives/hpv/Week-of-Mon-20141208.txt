Subject: [hpv] Berger modified Thys rowbike for sale
Message-ID: <CAEUdCEQTN=d+GF7ppTeVeDKat18pamSUT_17hWfSEvKFPe3u9Q@mail.gmail.com>

I am in the process of selling off most of my bikes. The most interesting
is my modified Thys 220 rowbike. Back in January 2000, I bought it used
from Derk Thys. It was great fun, but didn't work well on the hills around
here. I spent the next year modifying it, and it turned out amazingly well,
if I say so myself. I put 3,252 miles on it, riding on the Blue Ridge, and
doing fast century rides, mostly in the first three years. I get it out and
ride the six miles up and down our road, once a year, to relive my dreams
of commercial success.

If there are any fit, younger riders on here who would be interested in a
unique experience, this is your bike. Asking $750, or make offer. I can box
it up in two boxes. You pay shipping...continental US only.

That's what I anticipated when I rode Scott Olson's prototype Rowbike
nearly twenty years ago. Rocketed away from a stop like nothing else,
though ? helped (no doubt) by my experience since the early Sixties with
rowboats of many kinds ? with surprisingly easy steering.

Cornel,

After modifying the drive with my system, I had no difficulty climbing long
steep grades with an 11-34T, 9 speed cassette.  The steepest I actually
measured, and rode repeatedly, was a 17% grade.  There are two
limitations/annoyances with rowing up really steep grades.  At 4 mph, the
bike almost stops between strokes, and any hesitation in engagement of the
silent sprag or roller freewheel is amplified the lower your gearing.

A huge help, which allowed me to climb with my scrawny arms, was the
adjustable arm cable attachment.  By moving the cable down the riser, with
the quick release clamp, I can reduce the ratio of cable pulled by the arms
from 1:1 to 2:1.  This not only makes the "gear ratio" for arm strength to
leg strength more nearly equal, but makes steering at low speed much easier.
