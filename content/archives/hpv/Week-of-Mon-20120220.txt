Hi

To further my bike designs, I'm interested in publishing some of them as open source type plans.  Does anyone have good reccommendations for a site that would host such a venture?

I'm interested in posting designs, getting feedback, listing suppliers etc. and the bikes I'm working on are at http://modularbikes.com.au/bigatthefront.html

The bikes can be fairly simple, fast and effective and carry reasonable loads.  Already I've come across a few websites like http://www.python-lowracer.de/ and http://en.openbike.org/wiki/Main_Page and http://www.openwaterbike.com/ 

Thanks, Regards

Steve Nurse

thank you for contributing to opensource,
I found something like that on facebook,
only it's for open source cloroplast velomobile shell designs;
http://www.facebook.com/groups/15644592486/
maybe with your knowledge of keywords in your domain,
you can find something there too .

I had a [sort of] similar thought recently; check out this BROL thread:

Your bikes are great! Keep up the good work!

Cheers,

Thanks Ihab, lucky I didn't read the brol thread when I was thinking of these things, there are a few nay sayers out there!

Another large front wheel design I've done (and plans are there) is at http://www.modularbikes.com.au/zeica/

For me the small wheel at the back allows for a very simple, large carrying capacity, highly visible tail box which has great advantages for a practical vehicle used for shopping and general transport.  My latest bike can even carry a carton of beer, and I've done several 150k plus day rides on it. But not carrying beer!

Oh, and I almost forgot, videos from a very poor cinematographer

That's pretty nifty. I like the idea of a whole family of big/small wheel
FWD bents where moving-BB vs. twist-chain is a design parameter dependent
on the rider's preference.

I for my part have not had enough experience with moving-BB to tell whether
I like it. I have ridden various of them at Nanda Holz's dealership:

  http://www.spincyclz.com/

I found the Cruzbike Quest to be very easy to get used to:

  http://www.cruzbike.com/quest

but the Cruzbike Vendetta was scary and I'd need a much longer time, if
ever, to get accustomed to it:

  http://www.cruzbike.com/vendetta

Oh, and I almost forgot, videos from a very poor cinematographer

These are great, actually. With bikes, a video is worth a thousand pictures
;) because pictures don't generally show the sense of motion.

I love how you blew by the wedgie in the 1st one! :) The "inner trailer" is
pure genius!

The only problem with the videos is you were riding on the wrong side of
the road. Need to fix that, mate....

Hi, Thanks to Ihab and others who commented on my post previously, I've put 
a free set of plans for my bike on line and hope the posting will lead to an 
open source developement.

See 
http://modularbikes.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/starting-monsterbike-open-source-hpv.html 
for a link to the plans and

and 
http://modularbikes.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/survey-of-open-source-recumbent-bike.html 
for my survey of open source hpvs.

At the moment I'm not on facebook so couldn't explore the links to any 
facebook sites.

Regards

Steve Nurse

I've never seen these trikes before: very inspiring for home builders .
http://www.n55.dk/manuals/spaceframevehicles/spaceframevehicles.html
. I'm not sure I understand your bike's design;
when you steer, does it twist the chain ?
and does that tend to derail you sometimes ?
