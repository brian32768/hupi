While still listed on the website [1], it seems that the DualDrive hubs 
may not be available.  Anyone know for sure?  I need one as a more 
reasonably priced option to get wide range gearing compared to using a 
Schlumpf BB.

What size wheel do you need?  I have one laced to a 406 in my garage that was used very little before I installed a Bionx drive on my LEITRA.

They're in my QBP catalog and we just released the Cruzbike Quest 2.0 (FWD
recumbent) that has the SRAM Dual Drive II hub as standard equipment.

I've got several new in the box, including the disk brake version.  I 
also have spare parts which I had to special order from Germany.

I have spare parts for 3x7 hubs if anyone needs some.

There's a problem but I expect it to be solved within the next few 
hours, perhaps no later than tomorrow morning.

Our site was hacked last night at about 5 pm. It's back up now. Sorry for the delay. I've activated Seal Team Six to find out who did it.
