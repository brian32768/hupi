I'm guessing that I'm not the only one to notice that Sam Whittingham and the George Georgiev Varna Diablo made an appearance in the USA cable channel Versus' coverage of the 2010 Tour de France, albeit in a commercial for a sports drink, as "the world's fastest cyclist".

Kudos to Hydrive for this gutsy in-your-face celebration of the fastest bike in the world. 

If the TdF and the UCI is to be relevant to high speed bike commuting on the new bike superhighways they need to open up a time trial to unlimited bike designs.
