&gt;<i> The answer to that question is both yes and no. As an example, a common garden tomato can be defined by law as a vegetable in one place and &#160;in another place, can be considered a fruit. What is regarded as a bicycle in one country can be regulated as a motor vehicle elsewhere.

Right, but Fred's original comment didn't seem to be based on the
legal definition.

I can think of several reasons why choosing an ebike might be more
hopeful than, perhaps, choosing a four-door sedan, even if they're
both vehicles with motors.
