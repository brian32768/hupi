<PRE>Quote: Unfortunately, it's deteriorated into tiny battles between members.

Fred the Tiny battles have ended after booting out 5 idiots who were doing
all the arguing and driving everyone up the wall. We however still go &quot;off
topic&quot; a lot but it is
Allowed as long as it returns to what the Group is all about (whatever that
is).

I created yet another Forum for people with electric bents but that Forum is
fairly inactive. Recumbents and Electric Bents have kinda hit a wall these
last couple of years and it is as if the excitement that we had back in 2001
to 2004 has gone away. Almost as if we're all waiting for something Big and
New to arrive and nothing is on the horizon.

I've been Bent for 3 decades and these last few years has seen soooo many
new models come out and there should be a lot more excitement for the newest
models and yet it has turned into a yawn fest.

I see electric motors on bents as being a necessary evil re: the aging
population no longer able to travel on human power alone and it comes down
to dumping the bent or electrifying it. Been saying for years now if your
body can deliver the watts needed to power your cranks you don't need an
e-motor but when the ability to spin is going to hell it is time to
electrify.

P.S. a question for Greenspeed AU. When you dropped BionX why didn't you
switch to the 400W eZee brushless/geared motor system with their pretty
little Li-Mn or Li-Polymer pack?

I've been a member of the e-assist group on Yahoo, back when it contained
useful information and intelligent discussion. Unfortunately, it's
deterioriated into tiny battles between members. I'm also a member of a
number of electric vehicle groups and lists.  The discussion of Lithium
shortage pops up now and then, but it usually fades away. One post suggested
that Lithium is quite plentiful and a Google search will return a
fifty-fifty match of shortage/plentiful posts.

The China article is hopeful for the world, since the riders are choosing to
not buy motor vehicles.  The limits are quite severe compared to those of
many states in the USA. 12 mph max speed isn't very good and the weight of
the vehicle is quite low as well.  Florida requires that the bicycle retain
pedals, and that it cannot exceed 20 mph with a 170 pound rider on board, on
flat ground, no human power applied. Luckily, both Florida and Texas have no
other restrictions, so if you have an assist bike that will do 20 mph and
then go faster with human bean tossed in, you can go faster-er.

My AAW velomobile (now sold) has a Stokemonkey installed, from CleverCycles,
which runs through the left side crank, and therefore through the gears,
allowing best efficiency and power when used properly. I was able to run 37
mph on flat ground and full human bean, but only for a short time.  Loads of
fun, especially since the Stokemonkey requires that one pedal when the motor
is engaged. Any other implementation just felt wrong.

Not to be pedantic, but isn't an ebike a motor vehicle?
