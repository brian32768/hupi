<PRE>When I look at the morbidity and mortality of driving and road rage I don't 
see signs of great civility.
 
Motorist kill directly and indirectly.  I don't expect to have equal 
treatment under the law but rather expect special treatment for cyclists.  The law 
actually does give us some special handling, though enforcement and 
interpretation is usually applied by motorist.  You go to court not with a judge or jury of 
bicyclists.
 
Most motorist complain about bicycles.  Bicycles annoy them. (Cyclist don't 
stop at stop signs but a Florida DOT stop sign compliance study...Motorist 
compliance is only 35%) Motorists provide most of the energy which kills cyclist, 
pollute the air and water and use a third of some cities land...and I should 
be ok with their choice.  Motorist don't annoy bicyclists, they kill and mame  
them.  Maybe we should be more annoyed as cyclists?
 
Right of way establishes space for the movement of people goods and services. 
 A pedestrian has the right, the motorist and cyclist have the privilege.  A 
cylist is a lot closer to &quot;people&quot; than a motorist...nearly a ton closer..
