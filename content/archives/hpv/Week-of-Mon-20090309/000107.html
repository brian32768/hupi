<PRE>I like that name, &quot;Mile Square Park&quot;. Does that mean a turn, every mile 
around the park's perimeter?

Here in my home town the original downtown business district sports a 
four-way stop light every 400 feet (122 meters). The community was 
platted out in the late 19th Century, with foot traffic, horses, bikes 
and electric trolleys in minds of the founders. Hence, the blocks are on 
the small side, and the grades are gentle in most of the original 
neighborhoods.  It's similar to other small towns of the same age in the 
United States.

City law still bans bicycles from being ridden on the sidewalks in the 
downtown area.  It's an old law and a  good law, as it protects us when 
we travel as pedestrians.  A bicyclist is allowed to pedal the &quot;main 
drag&quot;.  But, automobile parking on both sides of the street  eliminates 
the possibility of bicycle ridding next to the curb during the day lit 
hours.  In this itty-bitty berg, &quot;same rules, same rights, same road&quot;, 
exist in the here and now as they have since the beginning. The 
resulting average traffic speed is modest. 
It's the repeated accelerations and decelerations that make bicycling 
impractical  for only a few blocks at a time. I can pull off a few  of 
those 800 watt power spikes needed to stay up with the horseless 
carriage traffic flow, but not too many and not too often.
