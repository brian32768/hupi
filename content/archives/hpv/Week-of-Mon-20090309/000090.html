<PRE>My favorite is the right-turn, U-turn, right-turn when no close traffic is
around. It's legal! Rarely are &quot;No U-turn&quot; signs around  an intersection, I
turned right, made the U, then turned right so didn't run the traffic light.

Car drivers seem to understand this move as well.

Bottom line is I'm not waiting at a light with no traffic coming, can't lose
that precious time to your average speed on a commute.

For static stop signs, to me if your wheels stop that's enough for a human
powered vehicle, no feet down. Having to put a foot down is a
non-human-power view of the situation of authorities trying to make it hard
for cyclists to blow through a stop with the intimidation of the fine. 

Those cyclists will blow through anyway, that's human nature so live with it
and stop being the Gestapo and ticketing people for not putting a foot down
yet having slowed way down (and I'm saying locking the wheels is kinda' OK
since it's about the same speed as most cyclists use as a &quot;stop&quot;). These are
people trying to get along but don't want to lose their momentum, it's
meaningful to hpv's and means nothing to drivers.

So, as people point out, if you lose all your momentum as a cyclist, to get
it back is a total loss to that person's limited energy supply.

Well, now and into the future as we watch the planet heat up, it's time for
human power to have the priority and putting a foot down is that one
regulatory step too far at human power speeds that rarely exceed 25-mph
unless it's down a hill.

Time for a break, if I slow way down or lock up my brakes my body isn't
going very fast, but to take away that last bit of kinetic energy has no
return, it's lost and must be made up by my body, and since I'm not burning
fossil fuel, eating must give me the energy to do it and that has a limit. 

Until cars eat to get where they are going and don't pollute the planet, I
refuse to put a foot down unless I see the cop, but am polite to any traffic
that sometimes may show up near enough to be respected.

Here in Scottsdale, AZ, they're thinking of forcing riders to put BOTH feet
down or you get a ticket, sounds like another money-making deal to me that
has nothing to do with public safety and made from the &quot;cars are king of the
road&quot; point of view that disses you and me, we ride &quot;toys&quot; to them. 

They're not used to having the same roadie waiting at the lights for their
trip to the store, they don't realize how much time they waste at lights,
you see them react. And, the latest sleeze look by these folks is that
anyone on a bike is out of a job or homeless, and I ride lycra all the time
.. sick.

Eh, I know the attitude you are referring to. It's something way beyond 
being an energy miser.

A couple of years ago, here, a cyclist all decked out with with all the 
shiny ToF toys and logo-ed Lycra clothing, came down a long hill in town 
as fast as he could, exceeding the posted speed limits, passing 
everything else on the road. He completely ignored the stop sign at the 
base of the hill, then turned wide into the path of an on-coming car 
driver who was making a legal turn. The combined impact speed was 
possibly in excess of 60 mph. The cyclist 's body did enough damage to 
the car to almost total it for insurance purposes. The road bike frame 
and wheels were twisted into weird shapes.  The biker went partially 
though the car's windshield on the passenger side, caving in the car's 
roof and hood in the process.  By pure miracle the cyclist survived and 
the car driver wasn't hurt too much, mostly just shook up, covered with 
glass crumbs and blood spatter. It was just a plain stupid move, on that 
cyclist's part which endangered the life of not only himself but of 
others as well.
