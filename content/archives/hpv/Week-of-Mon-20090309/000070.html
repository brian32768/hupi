<PRE>There are multiple sides on this situation. Bicyclists who break man 
made laws regarding stop signs are sometimes doing so in order to comply 
with Nature's legal system.

All bicycles when in motion store up Kinetic Energy (KE). That energy 
comes from human muscle and effort. Coming to a stop bleeds that 
personal savings investment off, like a robber's tax levied in Joules 
instead of dollars. Hitting the brakes changes human-derived power into 
waste heat. An additional component of that energy tax  is tacked on 
when restarting from a stand still, when the energy losses from braking 
must be made up for with an momentary energy spike. This is Newton all 
gussied up and dropped into the real world... &quot;an object in motion stays 
in motion until acted upon by an outside force.&quot;  Automobile drivers pay 
the same acceleration &quot;tax&quot;, but do so by purchasing additional fuel.

In an urban  environment,  which may impose frequent stops and starts, a 
cyclist  loses average speed as well as experiences a reduction in the 
maximal distance he or she is able to travel in a day's time.  In such a 
setting the force due to acceleration can represent the most significant 
form of parasitic drag encountered. Loses due to linear and rotational 
acceleration can be of a greater magnitude  than energy loss from 
rolling resistance, the force due to gravity on a slope, or even air drag.

The core problem is not cyclists or motorists, both of which are just us 
humans, rather it is a matter of older road design that in some cases 
needs to catch up to modern needs.

Here is another take on the situation presented in a recent VeloNews 
article:
