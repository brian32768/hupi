<PRE>If we want the special consideration by any level of government (local,
state, etc.) that would be required for reform and/or funding for specific
bike routes, we have to start by obeying the laws that are in place. Yes,
it's difficult to bike when there is a stop sign every few hundred feet.
Yes, the rules are different between us and cars, many times in favor of
cars. Yes, we burn a lot more energy and distance-riding-capacity every time
we have to accelerate, and yes, there are situations where you will have to
fend for yourself - the solution, though, starts by showing the difficulties
of obeying the status quo to your lawmakers, and constantly urging them for
change until you get what you want.
