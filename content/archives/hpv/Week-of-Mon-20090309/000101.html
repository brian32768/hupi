SRSRSR might be what you want, but I don't. Motor vehicles deservedly
are fenced around with restrictions and limitations, and I do not
think those should be forced onto human powered vehicles. Why argue
for limits you don't need?

At the same time, there are restrictions on hpvs that make a lot of
sense. We're not allowed on some roads, we are allowed into some
&quot;pedestrian-only&quot; areas. We can't park in metered parking areas but we
get to park on the footpath (and many other places).

I don't see motorcyclists or truck drivers campaigning to be treated
the same as car drivers. Could it be that they don't think all road
users should be treated the same?

Countries where cycling works well and is popular don't even pretend
that cyclists should be treated the same as motorised morons.

What's the advantage of the same rules idea? Psychological
legitimacy? Acceptance at the Chruch of Forester?
