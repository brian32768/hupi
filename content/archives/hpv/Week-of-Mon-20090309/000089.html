<PRE>Excellent points, well made, I say :-).

ISTR that there is *are* alternatives classes/races at some HPV events
which encourage non-&quot;racing&quot; bikes: yes, fastest time to get round a
course, but the &quot;course&quot; includes tests of manoeuverability,
loading/unloading shopping, parking, etc. Perhaps this kind of thing
needs to be more common, and/or be expanded to include more
starts/stops (without dismounting), mirror use, etc.? (not sure how to
do the last both competitively and fairly...but maybe brighter minds
can come up with something? :)).

better/faster negotiation of width restrictions, cycle barriers, and
stopping/&quot;idling&quot; at junctions!]

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...&lt;snip&gt;...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I was in your situation (and now I do this on La Costa) I'd take the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lane.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know about other HPV drivers, but to me the ability to constantly
</I>&gt;<i> monitor the activity of traffic behind in my lane seems to be the key to
</I>&gt;<i> both confidently using &quot;full lane mode&quot; and doing it safely and
</I>&gt;<i> cooperatively. &#160;This essentially means the ability to use a mirror (like all
</I>&gt;<i> other drivers do). &#160;As a result of design, some HPVs allow for a handlebar
</I>&gt;<i> position that facilitates handlebar mirror use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There may be alternatives to mirrors for this, but none that I know of.
</I>&gt;<i> While I would not suggest that a mirror can replace a head check for
</I>&gt;<i> instances like turns and lane changes, the mirror works best for /all/ the
</I>&gt;<i> moments in between. &#160;The majority of cyclists, even the skilled ones, don't
</I>&gt;<i> have a sense of their ability and need to manage the flow of traffic in
</I>&gt;<i> their lane, mainly because they cannot reliably observe it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cycling safety educators have done a good job of using crash statistics to
</I>&gt;<i> prioritize what cyclists need to learn to do safely, and I consider it
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable to keep novices focused on the problems of intersection
</I>&gt;<i> collisions over the more anxiety-ridden matter of the danger from overtaking
</I>&gt;<i> cars. &#160;This teaching encourages cyclists to use full lane mode more often to
</I>&gt;<i> improve their visibility to opposing and intersecting traffic, but it is
</I>&gt;<i> still muddy about interactions with pursuing traffic. This is
</I>&gt;<i> understandable, since the majority of bikes are not well-designed for the
</I>&gt;<i> use of handlebar mirrors. &#160;Helmet mirrors are usable, and I've discussed
</I>&gt;<i> their use with people who are capable of getting enough steady information
</I>&gt;<i> from them, but this takes technique and practice. &#160;I've beat the drum for
</I>&gt;<i> helmet mirror training as a part of the LAB Traffic Safety 101 curriculum,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'll agree with the authorities that there is only so much that can be
</I>&gt;<i> packed into a basic class.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, my anecdotal observation is that when trained cyclist get hit in
</I>&gt;<i> traffic it is from behind. &#160;This makes sense, since they have learned how to
</I>&gt;<i> better control the other dangers. &#160;Collisions from behind may be less of a
</I>&gt;<i> problem than from the front, but they still happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if we are to offer up the best possible &quot;urban safety cycle,&quot; it
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't necessarily have a personal injury lawyer in a trailer, but it
</I>&gt;<i> would facilitate easy stops, fast starts, and the ability to monitor the
</I>&gt;<i> traffic behind.
