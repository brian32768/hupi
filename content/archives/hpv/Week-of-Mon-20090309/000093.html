We mostly do, depending on the laws.

The default is that every driver gets the same amount of space: one
lane.  Even a slow vehicle driver gets the entire outside lane.
However, sometimes cyclists get less than that.

In some states, cyclists are only allowed to use the outside edge of
the outside lane, with some exceptions (see below).

In some states, cyclists are required to use a bike lane, which is
typically less than half the width of an ordinary lane.  There are
some exceptions (see below).

Usually, if the outside lane is narrow, cyclists are allowed to use
the full outside lane, same as any other driver.

Other typical full lane situations include traveling at the prevailing
speed, approaching intersections and driveways, passing, or preparing
to turn left.

Ultimately, the discriminatory far-to-the-right and
mandatory-bike-lane laws need to be repealed so that cyclists will
have the same lane rights as all other drivers.

But the situations where we don't have full lane rights are fairly
specialized.  Typically, all the following must be true:

* Cyclist is slower than prevailing traffic
* Outside lane is wide enough to share with passing traffic
* There are no intersections or driveways
