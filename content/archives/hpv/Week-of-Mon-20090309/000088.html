The fact that bicycles are mainly designed to win bicycle races but are 
then used on public roads lends to this problem.  A typical diamond 
frame bike, when &quot;properly&quot; adjusted, doesn't allow the rider to easily 
stop since their feet cannot reach the ground.  Motorcycles are not 
limited by this problem, nor are many recumbents.  I suppose we are a 
big choir of 'bent believers, so there is little gained by my pointing 
this out here, but a bike so configured as to let the operator easily 
place a foot on the ground for easy stops and at the same time have one 
foot on a pedal and the lower back against the seat for a fast start 
makes safe driving easier.  There isn't any way of winning a competition 
with this ability, but it contributes to cooperative driving.

I don't know about other HPV drivers, but to me the ability to 
constantly monitor the activity of traffic behind in my lane seems to be 
the key to both confidently using &quot;full lane mode&quot; and doing it safely 
and cooperatively.  This essentially means the ability to use a mirror 
(like all other drivers do).  As a result of design, some HPVs allow for 
a handlebar position that facilitates handlebar mirror use.

There may be alternatives to mirrors for this, but none that I know of. 
    While I would not suggest that a mirror can replace a head check for 
instances like turns and lane changes, the mirror works best for /all/ 
the moments in between.  The majority of cyclists, even the skilled 
ones, don't have a sense of their ability and need to manage the flow of 
traffic in their lane, mainly because they cannot reliably observe it.

Cycling safety educators have done a good job of using crash statistics 
to prioritize what cyclists need to learn to do safely, and I consider 
it reasonable to keep novices focused on the problems of intersection 
collisions over the more anxiety-ridden matter of the danger from 
overtaking cars.  This teaching encourages cyclists to use full lane 
mode more often to improve their visibility to opposing and intersecting 
traffic, but it is still muddy about interactions with pursuing traffic. 
This is understandable, since the majority of bikes are not 
well-designed for the use of handlebar mirrors.  Helmet mirrors are 
usable, and I've discussed their use with people who are capable of 
getting enough steady information from them, but this takes technique 
and practice.  I've beat the drum for helmet mirror training as a part 
of the LAB Traffic Safety 101 curriculum, but I'll agree with the 
authorities that there is only so much that can be packed into a basic 
class.

Still, my anecdotal observation is that when trained cyclist get hit in 
traffic it is from behind.  This makes sense, since they have learned 
how to better control the other dangers.  Collisions from behind may be 
less of a problem than from the front, but they still happen.

But if we are to offer up the best possible &quot;urban safety cycle,&quot; it 
wouldn't necessarily have a personal injury lawyer in a trailer, but it 
would facilitate easy stops, fast starts, and the ability to monitor the 
traffic behind.
