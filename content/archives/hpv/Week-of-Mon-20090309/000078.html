<PRE>In regards to:

 &gt;Dr. Fajans, a faculty member of the Physics department of University  
of California at Berkeley (UCB) wrote, and we quote;

 &gt;&quot;I've also spend some time exploring the effects of stop signs on  
bicycle commuters.  Maintaining the same speed on a road with stop  
 &gt;signs as one attains on a road without stop signs is very  
demanding.  For example, on a road with stop signs every 300ft (100m),  
 &gt;500watts of power will result in the same speed as 100 watts would  
get on a road without stop signs.  Since 500watts is far higher than  
 &gt;all but racing cyclists can produce, bicyclists on road with stops  
signs must slow dramatically.  These calculations were verified with  
road &gt;tests on California St. in Berkeley, a designated bike route  
with many stop signs.&quot;

Boo F-ing Hoo.

Really.  I'm sure the car drivers (with the possible exception of  
hybrid and electric vehicles with regen braking) don't appreciate  
using more gas.

Consider it effective interval training.  I, for one, am sick of the  
boi-racer mentality that can't be bothered to play by the rules of the  
road.  Yes, car drivers violate the rules too ... but &quot;they do it  
too&quot; (with the appropriate pouty facial expression) is no excuse.

Every cyclists who blatantly runs red lights and doesn't even make an  
attempt to slow and look, at a stop sign endangers me by creating a  
negative impression of all cyclists.  Treat it as a 'yield' if you  
must, but at least make an attempt at following the rules here.

(Yes, if the light doesn't sense the bike ... you can proceed when  
safe to do so, and so on and so on....)

SAME ROADS, SAME RULES, SAME RIGHTS.
