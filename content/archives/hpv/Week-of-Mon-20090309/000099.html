<PRE>As a rider of the vehicular cycling type for the past year or so, I've 
begun to recognize that we do have our place in the road.  Timothy 
Cyders has his head in the right place when he suggests that we must 
obey the laws in place for use of these roads.  It doesn't matter that 
motorists think we don't belong on the road, but it does matter when 
people on bikes display lack of regard for established traffic control 
devices.

I ride in the center of the lane at all times, because in my area of the 
state of Florida, none of the road lanes are 14 feet wide. I feel lucky 
that Florida has in the statutes a specific reference to a sub-standard 
width lane, which is followed up by a reference in the FL DOT handbook 
stating that fourteen feet is the minimum width in which a bicycle and 
motor vehicle can safely occupy side-by-side. (FL Statute 316.2065 
(5)(a)(3) and FDOT Green Book p.211)

Due to ignorant law enforcement officers, and a couple stupid ones as 
well, I'll be fighting two citations in court, and hope to establish a 
precedent which other cyclists in this state can use.  Some states 
aren't quite so accomodating and my sympathy goes out to cyclists in 
those areas of the country.

I'll be there, to add my two cents about educating the public and law 
enforcement to get this situation improved.  I've had people tell me 
they take the lane when cars start to pass them dangerously close. Why 
wait? It's the one you don't see that takes you out, not the one that 
gets too close. Florida has the inane three-foot-clearance passing law, 
which is a poor excuse for educating the motorists and the people on 
bikes.  I don't need that three-foot passing law to protect me, since 
I'm in the lane and people change lanes to pass.

I'll soon be an LCI, having completed the LAB Rolling Road One course, 
now called Traffic Skills 101. There are many experienced cyclists, but 
fewer trained and skilled ones. My recommendation is to find an LCI 
(League Cycling Instructor) and sign up for TS101. If you're lacking in 
your area, travel a bit and then become an LCI and benefit the community 
even more.

I used to gripe, now I'm doing something about it.
