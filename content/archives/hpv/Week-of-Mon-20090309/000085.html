<PRE>Take as an example a 100 kg rider and bike, typical garden-variety 
upright; CdA= 0.4 m^2, Crr=0.0050, drive train efficiency = 95%  then 
head down a flat road at 5.5 m/s (12.7 mph) on one of those rare 
windless days.

The distribution of drag components might follow this pattern; rolling 
drag 28 watts (36%), Aerodynamic drag 45 watts (59%), Efficiency loss 4 
watts (5%), total 77 watts (100%).

As a contrast, add in a complete stop every 100 meters, thus an 
acceleration from 0.0 m/s to 5.5 m/s in that distance. At the maximum 
speed (5.5 m/s) , just prior to stopping, the drag distribution 
transform into; rolling drag 28 watts (16%), Aerodynamic drag 45 watts 
(26%), Efficiency loss 9 watts (5%) Linear Inertia 93 watts (52%) 
Rotational Inertia (2 watts) 1 %, total 177 watts (100%). By having 
imagined a constant acceleration the rider's average speed will be less 
than 2.75 m/s (6.2 mph).

This was a crude model, but it serves to point toward how significant 
stopping can be for any cyclist.

The mythical average human can sustain a 75 watt power output for 8 
hours. The same person would be able to sustain 175 watts for 2 hours. 
That's a big difference for a utility cyclist..

Not too long ago, I was in a commuting situation where I was riding more 
than 30 miles a day, five or more times a week. Occasionally, though 
rarely the distance stretched to 50 miles a day within the town limits.  
I didn't ignore the stop sign laws (to my best recollection, Judge), 
just tried to find &quot;creative&quot; routes through town where the number of 
complete stops was minimized.

Fifty miles on the Interstate is a piece of cake compared to riding 50 
miles stop-and-go. No matter how far down the road I am, it takes just a 
handful of  800 watt power spikes as a result of accelerations to make 
getting back home an overly difficult challenge.
 
It's just a fact of life, not a complaint.
