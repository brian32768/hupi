Eh, I know the attitude you are referring to. It's something way beyond 
being an energy miser.

A couple of years ago, here, a cyclist all decked out with with all the 
shiny ToF toys and logo-ed Lycra clothing, came down a long hill in town 
as fast as he could, exceeding the posted speed limits, passing 
everything else on the road. He completely ignored the stop sign at the 
base of the hill, then turned wide into the path of an on-coming car 
driver who was making a legal turn. The combined impact speed was 
possibly in excess of 60 mph. The cyclist 's body did enough damage to 
the car to almost total it for insurance purposes. The road bike frame 
and wheels were twisted into weird shapes.  The biker went partially 
though the car's windshield on the passenger side, caving in the car's 
roof and hood in the process.  By pure miracle the cyclist survived and 
the car driver wasn't hurt too much, mostly just shook up, covered with 
glass crumbs and blood spatter. It was just a plain stupid move, on that 
cyclist's part which endangered the life of not only himself but of 
others as well.
