Good morning,
I'm not sure if anyone cares, but I came across this news article about a gas-powered 2-wheel Quest Velomobile - apparently unrelated to the one we know about on this list.

http://www.fasterandfaster.net/2010/01/quest-velomobile-honda-anf125i.html

Not sure if the builder got the door-opening idea from the Aeolus (where is that now btw?).  In any case it's a beautifully finished machine, very functional and fuel-efficient for single-rider trips in more kinds of weather than an unfaired motorcycle (colder weather mostly, still dodgy on wet or icy roads).  It's based on a Honday ANF125i motorcycle, but the rider sits low enough that the side-profile would be manageable in most wind and gust conditons.

The article also refers to earlier streamlined motorcycles, and their ban in the late 50's because brakes and tires of the day couldn't handle the necessarily higher braking and cornering loads.  I'd guess new tires, brakes and regenerative braking would mitigate or eliminate those problems today.  (He then dashes of to Sketchup his latest inspired idea...)

Good morning,
And OOPS!  It looks like the homebuilder is none other than Aller Jacobs - 
builder of the HPV Quest Velomobile.  At least according to this article...

Hope this inspires...

It is related to the one we know on this list as it is the same builder.

Take a look at http://www.velomobiel.nl/allert/ That is this project
by Allert Jacobs. Het is also the builder of the Quest Velomobile.

Awesome project documentation on the site!  (construction details, progress 
log, etc)  Thanks Mars.

Allert's website had a link (way way down far) to this electric fully-faired recumbent motorcycle.
http://www.bikeweb.com/image/tid/57

Looks like something that could be built as easily as one of Joe Kochanowski's creations.

The images come from a website dedicated to recumbent motorcycles.  There's some other cool stuff on there too.

Good morning,
Thanks to Mars for pointing out my oversight, about the same time I 
discovered it.

Then I'll add something else new I found about an NSU "Dalnik" streamlined 
motorcycle from the 50's.
