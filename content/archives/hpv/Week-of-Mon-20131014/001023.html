<PRE>Lots of flashy technology - but really still stuck in 19th century thinking.  SPEED 

Hey news reporters, we are in the 21st century !!!!!!  Different values needed. 

The Delft vehicle took a team of people and all kinds of technical machinery. 
George Georgief has held the records for many many years and he did it by himself, no fancy equipment. When I visited him on his island home off the coast of Vancouver I looked for drawings and such - there were non to be found. He uses his hands and eyes as guides. 

This is a wonderful story that the public should know about.  


I think I saw a millisecond view of Georges face congratulating the Delft team. That's typical of good hearted George.
