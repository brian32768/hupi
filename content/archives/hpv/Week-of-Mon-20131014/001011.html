<PRE>We actually visited Japan, some years ago.  I didn't use the underground
parking machines,

<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=pcZSU40RBrg">http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=pcZSU40RBrg</A>

but we went to a multiplex movie theater, with a three story bicycle
parking garage.

Like every culture, they don't do everything logically though.  We saw
thousands of nearly identical mama charies,

<A HREF="http://www.japancycling.org/v2/info/bikesj/mamachari.shtml">http://www.japancycling.org/v2/info/bikesj/mamachari.shtml</A>

all with the seat set too low for proper leg extension.  This is to allow
getting your feet down in a hurry which, in the crowded streets, they must
do frequently.  But it means they mostly stand to get started, and ride
around with their knees coming up to their chins.  It would make more sense
to ride feet forward bikes, but they would be a bit longer.  Space is at a
premium, I suppose, and if you rode one, you would stand out...not good.

All these bikes have kickstands, and in many places there are no bike
racks.  So they are lined up, by the dozens, in rows on the sidewalk.  It
wasn't unusual to see an entire line flopped over, like dominoes, people
patiently untangling their bikes.
