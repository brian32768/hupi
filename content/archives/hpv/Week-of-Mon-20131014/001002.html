<PRE>To clarify two points easily mistaken in my message: I moved to my Costa Mesa CA location within walking distance  48 years ago because I was on a swing shift and going to school full time days. The commute by motor scooter was killing me, or at least threatening to with the dense tule fog in the bean fields I passed through after midnight to get home. No I am not a professional, but I did succeed in getting a retirement after 35 years service to one company that moved my work place several times ending up in Santa Barbara where I took my early retirement in 1999. While I was a glorified technician who acquired the job description of 'Development Engineer' despite not finishing an undergraduate degree, I admit to being quite lucky in the timing of my career to have those privileges along the way. At each of those increasingly distant job locations I was able to commute by bicycle at least once a month. At Santa Barbara, I took a local rental with my Costa Mesa home rented out which allowed me to bike commute several times a week.

Having retired early I rode my modified F-40 across the U.S. but when I returned I was given the chance to help form a new company. The downside was the fifty miles (each way) to get there. While I was certain in those Dot.Com days that the job would only last two years before going bust, for me it lasted six years and is still going, thankfully without my help. I only did the bike commute on 'bike to work' days in those years.
 I commend you for doing the bermed solar passive home and accepting the consequences. Once I realized the benefits of the close proximity to the sea that I attained here in the OC, I became determined to hold on in this location(Santa Barbara would have been better, but beyond just about anybody in my income level who didn't buy there in the fifties). I live not quite so frugally, by having purchased a Duplex Apartment in which I rent out one unit and live in the other. It pays for itself and so I can stay here in this quite temperate climate on SS  income alone. Here in CA we have multiple solar industries competing to provide PV rooftop systems at no cost through State subsidies and public utility legislative connivances. Quite interestingly, I cannot meet their criteria because I don't use enough electricity. I cannot yet justify an electric car as i do local shopping  by bike but as grid connected solar is not feasible (not even if combined with my tenants usage, were that allowed) I am considering an electric car eventually which could justify the PV system. I already have installed a Thermal Solar array serving 100% of my hot water needs, and adding some better insulation to my north facing walls will allow most of my winter heating to be a byproduct of the stucco and thick plaster which serve as generally sufficient thermal mass because of the 'short thermometer' in this coastal community.

Last weekend I visited the  DOE Solar Decathlon this year held in nearby Irvine,CA. Most of those very well thought out Solar homes are about the same size as my 1950's vintage digs because of price constraints in the competition rules. While the winner was from Austria, just about all of them came fairly close to the goal of zero to positive energy production with modern comfort standards. The interesting fact for me was that they did this all without fossil fuels and using less efficient electric appliances.  Several were able to support solar carport charging of  commercial EV's on top of the zero fuel use. The 'Cruiser Class' in the Australian contest could have a place in our fuel less ideal future, but only for those in the &quot;outback&quot; who need the turtle-like ability get long distances rather slowly from their off grid locations.

 I like to joke with my rich Newport Beach neighbors at or near sea level that their profligate lifestyles will soon go away with sea level rise and it will be me that has near seafront property. Of course I will need my sailboat because the Mesa I live on will be an island.
