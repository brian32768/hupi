<PRE>&quot;Quick mention that a major deal is to switch away from fossil for
IC-engines on the planet, they will not disappear.

The best way to do that is algae, people in areas are growing it for
biodiesel in blue-tarp lined pits, luv the internet, pressing it in cloth
to get the oil and this is spreading where cash jobs are scarce, it's used
for cooking and heating as well.&quot;

My biologist buddy sez:

Growing algae and making biodiesel, using wastewater as the source of
nutrients is a great idea; really a good cleaner of water, as long as there
is very little of the various heavy metals in the sewage (one of the
biggest problems in using any sewage product).  I can't imagine that this
will ever be used as a major source of fuel, though.  Even though algae is
more efficient than terrestrial plants, the equipment needs are huge.   The
only way to get a decent yield is to use pure strains of certain species,
or even genetically engineered types.  That means growing inside a
sterilizable system, like glass pipes--enormously expensive!  Growing in
open systems means you get whatever wants to grow there, and those species
just wont make much at all, but are still good at sucking up wasted
nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

So a far better use of sewage than growing algae for fuel is using it as a
source of nutrients to grow crop plants.  Nitrogen fertilizer production is
one of the biggest energy users on the planet, but we just throw most of it
into our water systems when it runs off agricultural fields or inadequate
city sewage plants, and then into the ocean, where it causes algal blooms
there, destroying those ecosystems.   Phosphorus is even a bigger issue
than nitrogen--it's all mined, and a large fraction comes from places that
don't like us very much.  At the rate we are using it, we don't have enough
for farming to finish out the century.   Well-designed sewage treatment
plants, for cities as well as for farm runoff, could use algae to recover
nearly all phosphorus (and most other plant nutrients).

....if you did the math....

photosynthesis, at best, is maybe 5% efficient at harvesting solar energy,
 and then converting that to stored energy, like oil, is at best 2%
efficient (cells have their own energy needs).  So how many thousand acres
of glass pipes would it take to provide all of a town's fuel needs?  (I
don't know, but you get the picture).  Is a fantasy, like using fast-food
grease to supply us with all our transportation needs.   Or, if we just all
stopped using those electric toothbrushes, our energy problems would be
solved!

(but that rancid crap from Burger King works to power my tractor, and a
couple of other people's tractors, and keeps it from fouling sewage plants).
