<PRE>Unfortunately, the latest Nova show is all about going faster.  If you
obsessively troll the EV sites, like I do, you will find that, unlike much
of the EV talk in past decades, it is all about 0-60 times, and smoking
tires.  Any talk of slowing down is seen as defeatist.  When we dumped the
55 mph speed limit, conventional economists applauded raising speed limits
as good for GDP.  These are the same clowns who said moving manufacturing
out of the country would be good for the GDP.  So we drive farther and
farther, faster and faster, for less and less inflation adjusted income.
 How high would we need to raise the speed limit to balance our trade
deficit?  :-(

This afternoon I was looking through a fat, dusty, manila folder marked
ELECTRIC.  It is full of magazine, and newspaper articles about electric
vehicles, going back to the 1970's, and a 1986 Molicel rechargeable lithium
cell catalog, I had sent away to Canada for.  Seeing yellowed clippings
about the original Solar Challenge, almost three decades ago, talking about
how &quot;soon&quot; these advances will see us reducing our exhaust emissions, and
oil consumption was pretty discouraging, as today I read articles about how
&quot;by 2040 most Americans will be driving electric cars.&quot;  Of course,
scientists are also saying by then climate change will beyond hope of
stopping.
