I think people expected the batteries to be further along by now.  I think the only reason I see them on the street every day is combination  of incentives and subsidies. I think there are extra ones here in California. 

Yesterday I saw two electric Fiat 500s. I saw these being tested. Lots of people use the Jones St hill in San Francisco for stress tests. But these seemed to be in the wild. 

I never would have predicted that the #1 status car for silicon valley VCs would be an electric (the Tesla). 

Back to something I know a bit more about; I am surprised that there is any market at all for electric bikes, given the prices, and the numerous reports of problems.  They cost as much as gas scooters, but I suspect the lack of gas, license, and insurance costs must be an incentive, maybe more so in Europe.
