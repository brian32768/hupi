<PRE>First, riding a bike &amp; not owning a car are steps in the right direction so that's me, yet until all the IC-engines on the planet run a green fuel, game over, we need to chop CO2 emissions to zero or get close to halt the obvious possible negative results of not dropping it. 
 
So, hybrid vehicles are very important and hpv's are part of hybrids, being into frame design I think we need a design rating idea up front, that is to know which hybrids are lousy hpv's to ride no-power so users are prone to use assist too often against those that ride well.  To me that quality of riding well shouldn't be classed with hybrids that don't, having a discussion on this issue seem valid here to improve the development of hpv +assist, and avoid assist +hpv.
 
Then for algae to biofuel, scaled to city size it's not practical to extract toxins using chemicals cheaply but when you drink city water as reports indicate they are not fully removed, so, to me that implies the primary purpose of treating wastewater needs to be purification of the water, then as an intended consequence using algae to do the main cleaning you get the biodiesel but no fertilizer for cities, digesting the tainted leftovers for methane and have the least toxic waste to dispose of.
 
Since in poor areas of the world people are making biodiesel from algae in blue tarps over pits dug into the ground, really small engines are far better a match than electrics. Along those lines my own ideas for hpv-assist using a fuel have been a turbine in a hub using a fluid transmission to &quot;step down&quot; the &quot;gear&quot; while allowing the chain to add power as well.
 
If you look at model airplane engines by power rating they are tiny for 1.5-2 HP, so are small turbines ... later on that, needs money but that's the least intrusive addition as a strategy for a hybrid so far for me, use a different hub for the drive wheel and make it weigh no more than a good 7sp or more internal hub.
 
With one of these rear wheels home-brew biodiesel from blue tarps can make enough to never need to buy fuel for many people.

&quot;Quick mention that a major deal is to switch away from fossil for IC-engines on the planet, they will not disappear. The best way to do that is algae, people in areas are growing it for biodiesel in blue-tarp lined pits, luv the internet, pressing it in cloth to get the oil and this is spreading where cash jobs are scarce, it's used for cooking and heating as well.&quot;

My biologist buddy sez:
Growing algae and making biodiesel, using wastewater as the source of nutrients is a great idea; really a good cleaner of water, as long as there is very little of the various heavy metals in the sewage (one of the biggest problems in using any sewage product).  I can't imagine that this will ever be used as a major source of fuel, though.  Even though algae is more efficient than terrestrial plants, the equipment needs are huge.   The only way to get a decent yield is to use pure strains of certain species, or even genetically engineered types.  That means growing inside a sterilizable system, like glass pipes--enormously expensive!  Growing in open systems means you get whatever wants to grow there, and those species just wont make much at all, but are still good at sucking up wasted nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.   


So a far better use of sewage than growing algae for fuel is using it as a source of nutrients to grow crop plants.  Nitrogen fertilizer production is one of the biggest energy users on the planet, but we just throw most of it into our water systems when it runs off agricultural fields or inadequate city sewage plants, and then into the ocean, where it causes algal blooms there, destroying those ecosystems.   Phosphorus is even a bigger issue than nitrogen--it's all mined, and a large fraction comes from places that don't like us very much.  At the rate we are using it, we don't have enough for farming to finish out the century.   Well-designed sewage treatment plants, for cities as well as for farm runoff, could use algae to recover nearly all phosphorus (and most other plant nutrients).


....if you did the math....
photosynthesis, at best, is maybe 5% efficient at harvesting solar energy,  and then converting that to stored energy, like oil, is at best 2% efficient (cells have their own energy needs).  So how many thousand acres of glass pipes would it take to provide all of a town's fuel needs?  (I don't know, but you get the picture).  Is a fantasy, like using fast-food grease to supply us with all our transportation needs.   Or, if we just all stopped using those electric toothbrushes, our energy problems would be solved!


(but that rancid crap from Burger King works to power my tractor, and a couple of other people's tractors, and keeps it from fouling sewage plants).
