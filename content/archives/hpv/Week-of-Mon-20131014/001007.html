<PRE>&gt;<i>I got a suggestion from a list member that
</I>we move all the non-HPV stuff elsewhere.

......Seems to me that concern for the environment and HPVs can be so 
closely related that it would be a shame to separate them.
Their designs and the way we use them can affect the environment.

I am happy to learn what our HPV members are thinking and doing about the 
environment by the type of vehicle they choose to use.
I can and do go to environmental sites but then I loose the closer 
connections to HPV types and what they are experiencing.

And disusing only HPVs can become for me too disconnected from the 
environment and often shows in the vehicles that is being talked about.

My present HPV is used to do practically all my local shopping and running 
errands. Its design was influenced 10 years ago by speed and streamlining 
which isn't as useful for practicality. But what I have learned from my own 
experiences and learning from others, is going into a new design.

Yes if our environmental discussions take over for too long then again its 
not including the vehicle design.
