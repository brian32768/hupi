I've seen cargo tadpoles before, but not a "real" TV-style advertisement for one:

http://vimeo.com/79972861

"Real" as in, production values comparable to smogmobile ads, not "real" as in, normal people actually roll like that with any regularity. But, given the amount of "car porn" that infests mainstream media, it's good to see our side "fighting back."

All this work reveals an underlying truth: The sheer complexity of
inter-related species and habitat is essential for an ecosystem's health,
particularly for resilience to stresses like climate change. And the
inverse is also true

I agree. I got about 5 seconds into it, skipped forward a bit, and thought "that's just annoying" before I stopped watching.

I wonder if that's what they intended? And whether they have a website.

Nice to see a little action on this list again.

This thing certainly checks all the boxes: e-assist, belt drive, tilting,
cargo trike.

Unless the cargo capacity is consumed by a motor and battery pack I doubt it
could go anywhere near as fast as a velomobile or other fully faired
recumbent. Perhaps we should check with the OHPVA to see if this cargo bike
would qualify to compete in the spring HPV races at PIR. At minimum we would
have to get the guy riding it a helmet!

Charlie,

Uh, it doesn't quite check all of the boxes. What about the speed category?


Yeah, not speed.  But I have come around to thinking that speed is highly
overrated.  I have been fussing at the guys on Craig Vetter's streamliner
motorcycle email list about their obsession with going 70 mph into a 30 mph
wind, and the guy's on Endless Sphere about wanting e-bikes to run at moped
speeds.

The world needs to take a deep breathe, and slow down.  Our obsession with
speed is a major contributor to climate change, and the destruction of
communities.

Speed and aerodynamics are way down on the list for a practical cargo 
vehicle. So the lean and the weight and complication that's added to the 
vehicle is not needed.

My various travels in Europe I never saw cyclists speeding.
10 to 12 mph was a fine speed.

I'm afraid that the US addiction to speed is infecting the rest of the 
world.

If you are biking for aerobic exercise, you may have to ride faster than 12
mph.

No one in continental Europe wears helmets when cycling, except for 
sports cyclists.

Not that I would bother with a lid, unless it was something like a POC 
Trabec MIPS or better.

If you put the downtube above the chainrings it reduces drag enough to gain about 1-mph average speed faster on the same wattage, a reason it was outlawed when track bikes used it and proved it worked to reduce drag significantly. 

This is bike-polo style, a well known frame design, uses slightly less metal, nothing else needs changing just the position of the downtube. 

Doing this to commuter bikes can save a lot of food if done globally, by the megatons, just from moving the one tube up.

........Another market place hype. Aerobic. 

To average 12 mph in stop and go shopping and running errands in a typical 2 to 5 mile radius, higher speeds like 16 -17 mph on straighter sections are required. 
That's adequate of exercise if done 3 or 4 times a week. 

In the winter that average drops to 10 mph. 

This is in a vehicle that aerodynamics is not at the top of the list but weather protection,  crash protection, ease of access to decent cargo area, and low weight, are some of the desirables.

I don't see why not. Terracycle's Cargo Monster trike debuted at PIR a couple years back. Check it out at http://vimeo.com/4879249 (at about the 3 minute mark). A cargo race would be interesting if we could figure out the rules. 

FWIW: I may not make it to the Human Power Challenge this year. Family issues are causing me to be away from Portland quite a bit.

FWIW2: It's OHPV, not OHPVA. I don't think we've ever had the "association" in our name.

In all seriousness, if the OHPV(no A) is willing to consider adding a cargo
cycle category I recommend an emphasis on factors of than speed since that
is obviously not the intent of such vehicles. Handling an obstacle course
and hauling capabilities are the two factors that immediately come to mind.
I think the most fun and interesting hauling test would be achieved by
devising a progressively increasing load competition modeled after tractor
pulls.
