Subject: [hpv] Robert Barnett's arm and leg powered trike
Message-ID: <549D7C62.2000706@cs.cmu.edu>

Reviewing an old issue of "Human Power" (Number 53, Spring 2002 I came 
across a short article describing Robert Barnett's arm and leg powered 
trike. I have an interest in employing a similar steering system on a 
bike, and would like to learn more about how and how well this worked. 
Robert, are you there, or can someone provide contact information (or 
forward this request to him)?

If anyone else is working on combined arm and leg power, I'd love to 
exchange ideas.

Thanks,
