Yesterday I had a blowout on the front tire of my Challenge recumbent. Suddenly I felt like I was trying to balance on a pile of shucked oysters, all slippery and slidey.  Down I went and off went some skin from my elbow.  
 
My bike has 20 in (406) wheels to which I've mounted Schwalbe Marathon plus 1.5 tires with big Schwalbe inner tubes (I hate flats).  It has occurred to me that big fat tires on small diameter wheels would make it harder to control in case of a blowout, especially on the front wheel.  My thought is that the proportion of the effective radius that collapses in a blowout is bigger with fat tires and small wheels, and the rim would have a greater tendency to slide off the big pile of deflated rubber.  Have others had that experience?  Would I have had a better chance of control with skinny tires?

I tink that's a problem with fat tires in general, not related to small wheels. The extra carcass width gives you that much more sideways slop, which inhibits steering and balance. A skinny tire, even when deflated, would only slide sideways a bit before regaining some traction. 

A front blowout is tough to control in the best of circumstances. On a lowracer I think you'd have to have superhuman reflexes to keep from hitting the pavement.

The offsetting factor is that fat tires are less prone to blowouts.
Even if they get injured, with more volume it takes more time to
deflate. This has been my experience. I never really had problems
controlling my P-38 with 406 front wheel when I flatted.

Isn't rim width going to enter into this?

Hmmm... a fat tire on a narrow rim might be more likely to blow out, but whether it makes a difference once tire is flat... I dunno. I don't think it'll make that much difference, though.

Rim width shouldn't matter on a 1.5" ... that's not very wide.
 
Front flats are where you want full stop asap regardless of bike, tire or whatever, once the tire is flat life is a crap shoot on whether you go down or not, pave or dirt, macadam or track wood unless you're on sew-ups, a fine advantage in that way over clinchers but even they have limits.

I have had two instances of fairly rapid front tire deflation.

On a SWB RANS Rocket with a 44-406 Avocet Fasgrip Freestyle tire on the 
stock Alex rims, a tube tore at the valve, and after swerving a couple 
of times I went down.

On a LWB RANS Tailwind I had a large puncture on a 44-406 Tioga Comp 
Pool on a Sun Rhyno-Lite rim, and other than the bike feeling hard to 
pedal, it handled quite normally.

So the bike configuration and weight distribution can make quite a 
difference.

Yes, I think I am coming around to this opinion as well.  Falling with front blowouts on a low recumbent will happen for the average rider, no matter what the tire or wheels (unless the number is 3...).  (on an upright I might have kept my balance while stopping due the greater moment of inertia, but a fall would have caused more serious injury).

So how to protect oneself from this type of fall while still riding 2 wheels?  My fall was on a straight-away, mixed use bike trail (Burke Gilman north) with no near traffic.  I was going about 19 mph. After the blowout I went down flat on the right very rapidly.  I kept my seat and did not contact the road other than with my elbow and wrist (above seat steering Challenge Hurricane).  On my taller Infinity LWB I would have fallen out of my seat and injured my hip.  

So:  how to protect my arms from abrasion?  I am thinking that John Tetz's Zotefoam concepts would help.  Perhaps bands from the front fairing to the tail box would work.

. a shell can offer some protection from abrasion;
but it's no match for a direct collision
due to steering loss changing one's path
into that of some solid or
oppositely moving object .
. would an upright bike during a front flat
have the same instability
as a recumbent bike?
anyway, if going for recumbent,
the obvious choice of efficiency;
it seems then, for stability,
that more than 2 wheels are needed;
at least on air-filled tires
that could suddenly deflate,
(ie, a slippery road surface
is not the only source of
steering control loss) .

JW Stephens says he hasn't had trouble on his P-38 and I also have had no 
trouble with punctures on my P-38 based modified F-40. The ability of us to 
maintain control during front flats lies in this mid height, more upright 
style of recumbent. Both the low racer and the high racer do not allow one to 
easily drop both feet to the ground in such a situation with head high and 
the ability to sit forward decoupling balance of the body from the bumpy 
movements of the frame. Clipping in to the pedals can make even this recumbent a 
handful in such a situation with its quick steering.

 I don't use clips except for racing. Most of my falls have occurred in 
those conditions The fairing I ride with everywhere helps stabilize the bikes 
steering and though I cannot recall a full blowout on the front in the twenty 
years I have been riding this bike, I have withstood quite a few front 
punctures without falling. It is because I modified the F-40 fairing to be open 
at the bottom and developed my shoe pockets to keep my feet in contact with 
the pedals that I even considered riding it all the way across the U.S. ten 
years ago.

.....I have had a few crashes and the foam does a fine job of protecting me. 

Years ago I had a Lightning F-40. It was fast and a very practical bike. I raced it and used it for shopping and running errands pus several long distance self supported tours. 

But once I went down when the front tire blew I lost a lot of skin on my right arm. The Spandex provided lots of speed but zero crash protection. 

That's when I started looking for better shell materials and eventually discovered Zote foam. I am hoping even better foams will be developed 

A few years ago I ran into a young boy when he ran directly in front of me. I was doing 15 mph in my white streamliner. We hit hard and both of us went down. He was not hurt nor I. The nose of the foam had collapsed in acting like a crush zone. I popped out the nose and rode off.  

The other thing about foam is the vehicle stops sliding quite quickly where as a hardshell streamliner slides and slides until it hits something.

Hi,? 
Ive had three front tire blowouts with my loracer, two were with 451 IRC tires, and the third was with a bmx microknobby 451 on the loracer.? I stayed up on two of them, and went down on the third because I couldnt get my feet down fast enough.? I braked super hard on both ends of the bike and was able to get my feet down quickly. The bmx microknobby is about the only 451 that has significant tread on it and its about a half inch wider than the irc s one and one eighth tires.? It was on one of the irc s that I fell.? I now run an IRC on that bike, but was able to find a thornproof tube in that size that has served me very well.? I believe that the bmx microknobby, is not capable of running seriously high pressures, such as a bit over a hundred, it was just after I hit a serious bump, very serious, that the tire blew off the rim. The inflation was at 105, so if anyone tries one of those tires, hopefully run it at 90 and dont hit bumps.? I actually
 reused that tire after the blow off, but at 90 psi on a lightly loaded lwb, no problems at all with that combination. YMMV
