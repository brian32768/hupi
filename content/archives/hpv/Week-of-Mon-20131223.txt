My winter trike has a 2WD system where the outer shell of an 8/9 speed freehub body is rigidly attached to the middle of a jackshaft. BMX freewheels on the ends of the shaft transmit power to the rear wheels. When turning, the freewheel driving the outer wheel freewheels. when one wheel slips, the other gets the power.  

Due to the lightly loaded front wheel, (20-40-40 weight distribution) and the fact that the inside wheel gets the drive in turns, I expected the front wheel to plow in tight, low speed turns. It does so on clean lake ice or a rink but street ice is never as slick. The reason it grips so well I attribute to the 54 degree head angle, which causes the tire to be banked into the turn. A bike tire leaning into a turn will always grip better than one that's perpendicular to the surface.   

I was on a tight budget at the time so built it almost entirely of stuff I had lying around. Wheels are just conventional MTB wheels with rim brakes. So I had to support both sides.   

If I were doing another winter trike I'd use 700 - 32 rear tires to better cut through the snow, either cyclocross or studded. The jackshaft would be much shorter and single sided wheels mounted on half shafts with inboard disk brakes.  Frame could be much simpler and lighter.  For a summer trike, smaller, right wheel drive and 20"x2.35" Big Apples at 30 PSI

Freewheels mount on fittings I bought from Lightfoot Cycles. Just bolted through holes drilled in the 3/4" x 0.120 jackshaft. Lightfoot must have liked the idea because they came out with 2WD a year later.  Right wheel has a single cog mounted on a cassette body that had been locked with a bit of welding.  There is a 3rd bearing behind the cassette.

66" wheelbase is to limit weight transfer off the front wheel and to get it out in front of the fairing.  54deg. head angle and 5-3/4" of rake gives 3/4" of trail. I would never have that much trail on a 2 wheel 'bent, but I wanted feedback to let me know how much grip I have. Front tire is a 20"-1-1/8" knobby.

Inner skirts on the fenders keep salty snow off the secondary chains.

   Thanks Mark for sharing your 2 wheel drive Delta. 

 

Rich Saddler is working with me on our Delta and has a very similar system . He however keeps the freewheels on the wheels. 

This means the right chain will be outside the shell on the vehicle though.

 

Do you think the wheels driving the chains will affect coast down resistance?

 

Also;  How do you set the toe on your vehicle ?

.......Not sure as to how this can be done given the discs on the wheels have to insert in the caliper unless a removable axel is used. 

 

How is your Cog set attached to the jack shaft?

Tom that's kind of funny because I wrote that article on modifying a 
Freewheel for left hand drive many years ago.
That was for my Low FWD bike that I have used for many many years. It still 
has the left hand freewheel on it.

It's a bit too much work to modify them.

Unless you weld the calipers on to the frame you can remove whichever
is easier. For my quad removing a rear wheel means removing the
caliper, or at least one bolt on the mount so I can pivot the caliper
up to let the rotor move out. It's easy enough and IMO not worth the
hassle of coming up with a better system (I have seen some gems at
AIPP events, built by people with CNC machines and too much time on
their hands).

I was in Washington D.C. last weekend to visit my wife, who just started a new career as a patent examiner. Since she's working full time (no time off yet), I looked around the Smithsonian, among other places. In the process, I visited a collection of significant human-powered airplanes.

The Gossamer Condor is at the Air & Space Museum on the Mall:
http://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/multimedia/detail.cfm?id=939
It's looking a little worn and wrinkled and in need of a good dusting.

The Gossamer Albatross is at the Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport:
http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19810428000
It's in better shape, or perhaps the lighting hides the wrinkles better.

One of these is the Contes Engineering quad BMX/mountain bike: http://contesengineering.com/ . I've seen a couple in person, and there's lots and lots of custom parts involved.

It uses a Samagaga differential in the rear, which is apparently commercially available. It certainly looks easier to implement than a multiple-chain system, plus it gives true differential power to the rear wheels and a mount for a disk brake: http://www.samagaga.com/Default.aspx

Hi

After working on a leaning delta trike for several months, an article
about it and similar trikes has been published on the Hupi Website.
(Jump off from http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm) Thanks to Theo
Schmidt for helping with the publication. The trikes uses a standard
crank mechanism to mount the rear wheels? Vi voung pioneered this
construction and there have been a few trike builds using this
technique (see also http://en.openbike.org/wiki/~iLean)

Don't you want two disk brakes? Or do you not like differential braking?

The advantage of a differential is that if one wheel loses traction
you grind to a complete halt. That's why I wanted not to have a
differential. Differentials solve a problem that for the most part
HPVs don't have - enough power that unbalanced drive makes the vehicle
unstable.

Tf you go to downloads there's a PDF
http://www.samagaga.com/Download/DG72N_Torsion_Test.pdf that says it
will take 1100 kgf-cm, which I interpret as kilogram-force-equivalent
centimetres, so we multiply by 9.81 to get Newtons then divide by 100
to get metres, or 108Nm. Or multiply by the size of Obamas hand then
divide by the square of a horse and add the weight of three barleycorns
to get 84 and 17/48ths grossweigles per eigenstate for those using
imperial units.

When I ran the numbers after breaking some shit I got this: 100kg at
165mm is 981N*0.165 = 162Nm at the bottom bracket. with a 24T chainring
and 34T rear sprocket that's 229Nm at the rear axle.

That's only twice what the device is tested to, so it might work. I'd
ask about warranties, and I wouldn't let Moz ride it.

Interesting. AFAIK the Greenspeed Anura uses a Samaga differential.

In that case I've seen it, and it looks about as substantial as a soft
drink can. Which is fine for the intended market (old people), but not
for a load carrying vehicle.

It's possibly also protected by the design, in that the peak load on a
dual freewheel system occurs when one wheel slips, but with a
differential in that situation there's very little load because all
drive goes to the slipping wheel.

The freewheels in my quad are significantly larger diameter and made
of steel.

I know. I'm not as young and fit as I was, myself. But by all means,
if you want to ride a load-carrying trike with a hundred kilos of
stuff in the bin, be my guest.

If I build any non-winter trikes they will be right wheel drive to counteract road crown. But if trail isn't excessive, ie. over 3/4", left wheel drive works just fine. Penninger and Lightfoot are two where you couldn't tell which wheel dives without looking.

On the Kettwiesel it may be worthwhile, at least with a large rider. I've heard people complain that on steep hills the front wheel can become so lightly loaded at the strongest part of the pedal stroke that 1WD can push the front wheel sideways. The advantage of a Delta is that you can put more weight on the paired wheels, moving the CoG further from the rollover axes. With a delta as short as the Kett, if you lead up the rear wheels the CoG isn't that far ahead of the rear wheels. Given a rider with a tall CoG weight transfer can be an issue. A little longer wheelbase adds little weight and eliminates this issue.

AFAIK No one has produced a high performance delta so people are unaware of it's advantages for a sporty trike. I ride a delta because with 80% of the weight on the rear wheels your CoG is so far inboard of the rollover axes that even with a 19" seat height it's almost un-tippable.  I rode a tadpole with a 19" seat height. It had no front brakes as using them would have put the chainrings on the pavement, yet it was hard to take a corner without lifting the inside wheel. 

You have to be down on the ground for a tadpole to make sense but I'd rather be up where drivers can see me.  At least the ones who aren't texting :-(

I'm a big fan of freehubs and cassettes. I've broken or bent too many axles on FW hubs. And don't get me started about removing freewheels on tandems.

With conventional 10mm axles, 7 speeds seems to be the practical limit in most applications. More makes the unsupported length of the axle too long

But for some HPV situations, in my case I'm looking at a delta drivetrain, the new crop of freewheels from SunRace and DNP has potential. You can even get an 11-36 10 speed from SunRace.  The DNP Epoch FWs look quite nice.  In some cases the cog selections make more sense than Shimano's cassettes.

DNPs 11-34 is odd, but maybe brilliant. 
11,13,15,17,18,19,21,24,28,34 they just dropped an 18 into the middle of their 9 speed. giving a wide range, but with ultra close ratios right where I do most of my riding.  

I can't imagine many people wanting these, but QBP has them in significant numbers.

I've bought these for use with Bionx motor wheels.  I'm glad that I can 
get these in 9 and 10 speed designs so we can do conversions on modern 
bikes without replacing the whole drivetrain and transmission.

The Rans Trizard was in this direction, but it had some refinement issues, and was not on the market long.

Why I Don't Ride a Trike.

You makers and partakers of trikes have this argument about once every decade. Delta v Tadpole, utility v  road handling. No one seems to be able to address both issues at once, or wants to , it would seem. 
A very long time ago, I proposed to a trike builder that the solution might be to make a Tadpole which would arch upward shortening its wheelbase as it came to a stop. This would entail some serious engineering to put the stop limits and locking mechanisms at the right height for safe operation but could make such a machine both efficient and user friendly.  It would partly solve the vision problem of low trikes at intersections. The differential release of the front and rear brakes could then be used to enable the stored energy of the rider's height to push off once again, saving a gear shift or two. 
I suppose if this old geezer wants to see such a thing before final check-out I had better get busy designing it.

Au contraire Reg. It is exceptionally easy to arise from a low tadpole. You
use momentum before stopping to propel you upward. Sounds difficult, really
easy in action. YMMV of course.

Actually the best solution I have seen was Wayne SooHoo's leaning trike.  It allowed a narrower track and a higher seat height.  Too bad it has never gone in to some form of production or at least sell the locking mechanism with plans for a kit.

Gee I easily qualify as an old geezer, but I have no problem getting up off 
a seat that is 7 inches off the ground. But then I have a above seat 
handlebar system on my tadpole.

Back 9 years ago I wrote up my trike design philosophy, which started with 
the issues of getting in/out of a shelled vehicle. It all centered around 
the above seat T shaped handlebar system.

To get up off a low seat I grab a brake so the vehicle wont move, grab the 
center of the handlebar and pull myself up, and step out of the vehicle. 
Easily - no struggle.
I also use the same system to lower myself with ease down on the seat.

I also use the handlebar to push and steer the vehicle as I walk along side 
it to move it from one place to another. I do this a lot when shopping and 
running errands and parking the vehicle at home.

I also grab the handlebar for stability as I get in/out of my  vehicle. 
Because I don't need to put any of my weight on the shell it allows the use 
of very light shell materials.

I also grab the handlebar and back of the seat to lift the vehicle. It helps 
that it only weighs 45 pounds (that's trike with shell - shell is around 7 
pounds).

When I have run without the shell my trike out coasts other trikes because 
they have side stick steering (more frontal area - my arms are more in line 
with the airflow).

This handlebar allow smaller lighter canopies.

Yet to my amazement, in all these years essentially no one is using above 
seat handlebars.

I have recently did a write up on details of this system. I call it
T Bar. T for its shape and T because that's the letter of my last name.

Paul Sims of Greenspeed built and raced one at a couple of AIPP events
without noticeable success. The trike was fast but not remarkably so,
and it was more complex than perhaps strictly necessary (leaning). But
perhaps Paul just has no idea how to design a fast delta trike, since
(like everyone else) he seems to have failed.

I suggest that those talking about how good a fast delta would be
actually build one and win some events. Battle Mountain, Murray
Bridge, an IHPVA world championship, whatever you like. But right now
all the trike races I've seem are dominated by tadpoles (in the "OMG,
look, a delta!" sense) and the fastest trike at Battle Mountain has
been a tadpole for some time now. The trike 6, 12 and 24 hour speed
records are also held by tadpoles.
