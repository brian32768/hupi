The bad news. Braking lasts for only seconds at a time, in stop and go 
traffic, but batteries need long charging times.

The good news. Researchers at MIT have been working on a new 
rapid-charge battery technology.

Subject: [hpv] SR^3
Message-ID: <49BE655D.4040307@att.net>

Just to clarify some history, the phrase "Same roads..." was originally 
quoined by Jack Taylor of the Southern (USA) Bicycle League sometime in 
the mid-1990's.  This was reported to me by Fred Meredith, editor of 
Austin's Southwest Cycling News and an LAB boardmember, who met Mr. 
Taylor at an LCI seminar in Atlanta in 1996.  Mr. Meredith began to 
popularize the phrase here in Texas.  The elements of the phrase get 
rearranged quite a bit, but it all points to the same goal.

Speaking as someone who supports the notion, I'll admit that it is 
possible to juxtapose the obvious differences (between an HPV and 
gasoline engine powered vehicle) with the concept of "same" and produce 
some absurdities.  Let me suggest that "same" in this case is more of a 
shorthand for "greater equality," which is meant, practically, as a 
counterweight against outright discrimination and restriction.  That is 
the background and context against which the SR^3 slogan needs to be 
understood.

A similar argument can be made for equality of the sexes in the 
workplace and society.  Yes, there are obvious differences between men 
and women, but the plodding business of social evolution and legal 
precedent is better directed by assuming "sameness" until some 
intractable difference gets in the way.

Diversity of traffic laws among cities and states (in the USA) makes a 
mockery of "same rules."  And lingering bigotry in the minds of those 
who enforce the laws makes a mockery of "same rights."  And "same roads" 
is a fairly depressing notion when you can picture how nice it would be 
to get away from the deadly stink-mobiles and their incompetent 
operators.  When the time comes that cyclists have the numbers to 
command a suitable chunk of infrastructure spending then we'll have 
space built to our standards, and we'll even have it without the design 
compromises that currently turn good facility designs into clumsy, 
ambiguous facility realities.  But the truth is that we are having to 
make the best of a bad situation, and that means being provisionally 
happy with something "less bad," while recognizing that it is not really 
as "good" as what our visionaries can describe.

Keep a steady cadence...

I have tought about a system using compressed air with the frame as the 
storage vessel.

Or, using a capacitor for storage in an electical system. A capacitor would 
charge as fast as power could be generated.  Again, the capacitor could be 
integal with the frame tubing.
The bad news is that the energy losses involved  in these schemes does not 
justify the extra weight.

Thank you Mike for the background and explanation of the meaning of SR3.

SR3 seems  possibly an opposite of another slogan "Copenhagenize".
 
In Copenhagen Denmark the city planners created a multi-tier 
transportation infrastructure, separate lanes and facilities for 
automobiles, bicycles, pedestrians, and rail trains. One result of this 
approach  is that now well over 30% of all personal trips in the city 
are accomplished via bike.

The average speed of the massive fleet of bikes is rather laid back, and 
easy going -- happy. Helmets seem to be something worn on the noggins of 
little kids, not adults.

"Slow bicycling is a lifestyle in Copenhagen, where 500,000 people cycle 
each day to work or school. Interestingly, the average speed of this 
mass of two-wheeled humanity is 15.3 km/h. That's not decided by 
consensus or by implementation of speed limits. That is simply the 
organic speed that half a million people settle upon when given the 
chance." -- quoted from  http://theslowbicycle.blogspot.com/

The blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic provides a delightful eye opening peek at 
how cycling serves as a positive part of many people's lives . 
http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/

And as the cherry on top, here is the link to the Danish government's 
explanation of bicycling in Copenhagen,
http://www.denmark.dk/en/servicemenu/news/focuson/copenhagens-take-on-bicycles.htm

Use "bicycling in Copenhagen" as search terms in Google to turn up a 
basket load of other fascinating web pages.

Yes, but they also accept charging at high rates if not already "full". Unless
you start your electric bike trip at the top of a hill, there is no problem.

Most electric bikes don't have regen braking purely for cost reasons. The BionX
drive however does, and it works well. It cuts in before the mechanical brake
(you set this yourself with the placement of a magnetic sensor near one of the
brake levers) and you can also choose 4 different levels of braking from the
push-button control for longer descents (and program the controller in all sorts 
of ways).

People have reported up to 40% better range, but the main benefit would be due
to less wear on the mechanical brakes (and rims if applicable).

As people like to accelerate, they presumably would also like to brake for stop
signs - if they know that it is a well working regenerative thing - as they then
get to accelerate again.

The capacitor could absorb and supply a great deal of power for a few seconds, 
allowing very high acceleration. I don't think it would help for braking much, 
as braking power is limited by mechanical constaints (friction, center of mass).

It does if you have an electric bike in the first place. The energy density of 
batteries is higher than that of humans. The weight is however as you say 
probably not justified purely on the grounds of regeneration.

I've never seen an IHPVA practical vehicle competition, but it does seem
like a step in the right direction.  My impression is that it compares
load carrying capability and stability in difficult low-speed 
situations.  That is useful stuff, but it isn't a measure of how the 
vehicle facilitates comfortable interaction with other drivers.

Having thought about it myself, I have an idea, though it could use some 
improvement.  We face a paradox since we are using competition between 
the cyclists to hone development, but what they are being developed for 
is a cooperative enterprise.

Two or more teams of ordinary practical commuter cyclists are equipped 
by sponsors with bikes and/or gear designed for use in traffic.  The 
teams would carry the logos of their sponsors around for all to see, of 
course, and they would be clearly marked as a competitor in the event. 
The event takes place in some city, and all the sponsors contribute to 
an advertising campaign that announces that the competition will take 
place on the public streets for the next couple of months.  The teams go 
out and pursue their daily lives, and the public is encouraged to call 
in with compliments or complaints about any participating cyclist they 
encounter.  A panel of judges reviews all feedback, and awards points 
accordingly.

This makes scoring a subjective matter, much like the way a speech 
tournament is scored, which isn't good but it is the only way I've 
though of so far.  It relies on public input, and there would need to be 
some effort to curb interested parties from making false claims.  But 
this method is appropriate because the reactions of other drivers are, 
to a great degree, what good driving is about.  Of course, a complaint 
wouldn't necessarily mean bad driving, since there are cases, like a 
narrow lane, where the safest and most predictable practice will likely 
inconvenience a motorist, but that is more a matter of what expectations 
the complainer had and how realistic they are.  That is why the judges 
review feedback and assign the points.

The main effect of such a competition would be increased public 
awareness of cycling safety as a technique executed by the cyclist. 
This isn't the only facet of cycling safety (motorist behavior and 
facilities design are other factors) but it is a frequently overlooked 
one (with the non-productive exception of grouching about /really bad/ 
bicycle driving, red-light-runners, et.al., while overlooking the more 
subtle business of interacting smoothly).  It would also focus 
discussion among cyclists about what is the "best way" to deal with 
situations, and more detailed analysis of the situations, to avoid the 
ambiguities that cloud discussions of best practices.

40% is highly optimistic for an ebike.  For a typical trip expect to
recover more like 5-15%, depending on hilliness, number of stops and
starts and controller sophistication or user skill in modulating regen
current.

The 40% figure was from Frederik van der Walle here:
http://waw-bionx.blogspot.com/

Disscussion about this:
http://osdir.com/ml/culture.transportation.humanpowered.velomobile/2005-10/threads.html#00013

It depends of course on your speed. In ideal conditions you would be travelling 
uphill and downhill at a speed where air and rolling resistances are slight. If 
the total efficiency of your drive and battery is 70%, you would get almost 50% 
back in these conditions.

Frederick's observations were made on an aerodynamic vehicle ridden
repeatedly up and down a 1.5km hill at moderate speed, a test contrived to
maximize the effect of regenerative braking.  Most trips are not like this
and will not see this much energy recovery.

They're different, but not mutually exclusive.  It's possible to
accommodate the full range of cycling preferences if we choose to:

And while we tend to talk about roads, rules, rights, and bikeways in

There's a recent breakthrough on LiPo batteries, enabling a battery to  
accept a massive amount of current and deliver the same.

http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/03/lithium-breakthrough-could-charge-batteries-in-10-seconds.ars

Lithium breakthrough could charge (or discharge) batteries in 10 seconds

A new version of lithium battery technology can either provide a  
higher storage density than current batteries, or can charge and  
discharge as fast as a supercapacitor, emptying its entire charge in  
under 10 seconds. ...

The new work involves well-understood technology, relying on lithium  
ions as charge carriers within the battery. But the lithium resides in  
a material that was designed specifically to allow it to move through  
the battery quickly, which means charges can be shifted in and out of  
storage much more rapidly than in traditional formulations of lithium  
batteries. The net result is a battery that, given the proper  
electrodes, can perform a complete discharge in under 10 seconds?the  
sort of performance previously confined to the realm of  
supercapacitors. ....

For an eBike that just was used as an assist on hills or when starting  
out, you could use a smaller capacity (LIGHTER!) battery and have it  
accept a great deal of energy from braking.  You could also draw out a  
greater amount of current for hills.

I think this would be quite applicable to Velomobiles, with their  
great weight and lower Cd.

Oh yeah, you'll NEVER charge up an electric car in 10 seconds.  The  
best solution to that is what "Better Place" is doing.  Robotic swap  
of battery pack in a few minutes.

However, you will be able to pretty much do ALL your braking via Regen  
and nothing I mean NOTHING will ever match the acceleration of an  
electric car with these sort of batteries.  A Tesla does 0-60 in 3.9  
seconds with a bank of A123 batteries.  You could accelerate at the  
limit of adhesion  and with electric drive it is very easy to design  
control systems that will prevent you from engaging wheel spin.

FYI: DeWalt has a 48v portable power tool system on A123's ... charges  
up in 5 min.

As to these new batteries, my point was you could use a smaller setup  
and still absorb the energy from regen.

The new lithiums may help this with their very fast recharge times by
allowing much higher rates of capacity to be filled before the bottom of the
hill or the end of the stop.

The success of the new hybrid cars rests on this new battery material, it's
passed the crash test without igniting so is moving through certification
for cars. 

For a regen to work I think you still need a decent capacitor bank to store
the current spike, then use that before it leaks out to charge this new
material. This seems feasible so far. Without it in braking I personally
don't think you'll have enough time to get enough of spike even with the new
material to matter much.

Read of a new combo that fully charges in 10-20 seconds, but that's much
farther from production than what I'm referring to but probably needs the
same idea with capacitors to be practical for braking but obviously way less
time to hold it before leaking out.

Frederick's observations were made on an aerodynamic vehicle ridden
repeatedly up and down a 1.5km hill at moderate speed, a test contrived to
maximize the effect of regenerative braking.  Most trips are not like this
and will not see this much energy recovery.

I'm more interested in what it says about the charge efficiency of
the cells. Currently losses in NiMH are a major limitation on charge
rates - because you lose 20% or so of the delivered power as heat,
charging too fast melts the battery. RC models use forced air or
water bath cooling for their fast charge systems, but that's not
going to work outside those specialised environments.

So if the new cells suck up charge that fast they can't be losing
energy as heat during the process or they'd explode. It's all very
well going from 300K to 330K in a one hour charge, but if your charge
cycle is 10 seconds for the same input you'd be getting hot enough to
melt plastic (and thermal expansion alone would make cell design
tricky). So I'm guessing that means an efficiency closer to 99% than
80%. Which is great news.

Scott, rough numbers for you:

A Prius uses about 13kWh/100km and goes about 50km on batteries
alone, so has a battery capacity of about 6500Wh. Assuming 100%
charging efficiency that's 6500WH * 3600 seconds/hour / 10 seconds,
or about 2.3MW. Your house probably has 220V AC electricity available,
so 2.3MW means about 11kA at 220V (assuming a 90% efficient charger).

Can you get 11,000 amps out of your 220V outlet?

Now, my welder can do 200A for a 10% duty cycle and the copper part of
the cables there are about 5mm diameter. 11kA is more than 50 times
that, so the cables would need to have roughly 35mm diameter copper in
them. That's 35mm diameter from the street, through your house and
into the charger for your car. A lot of copper - thousands of dollars
worth.

I know you replied to me, but I can't see anything in what you wrote
that's a response to my message. Could you clarify why you included

Your observations and the interesting link suggest a slight amendment.

"All transportation is intertwined with" how we share public space.

This suggested change comes from experiencing, while aboard a  kayak, 
how a single motor boat operator who ignores or is unaware of no-wake 
zones can take over a public space (e.g.,a water way). This matter of 
maintaining civility between humans who use motors and those humans who 
use muscles for propulsion magnifies when on the water.

Sometimes I think we humans, and the birds too, are just plain lucky 
that swarms of flying cars (motorized or human powered) don't exist, yet.

A pricey speed machine isn't really what the world needs, but I expect 
that it has its place in development.

Keeping it relevant to the list, one could reasonably ask why the world 
needs racing HPVs that require a crew to get it underway.  Because it 
isn't the final product, only a necessary stage of development that has 
innate interest to those willing to invest in them.

In Tesla's case, it is a chance to fund more practical, lower 
profit-per-unit items.  Their next model, an ordinary sedan, is on the 
drawing board, but won't likely appear until business loan money comes 
back.

If you only have a small factory it makes more sense to produce a 
Ferrari than a Kia.  Small bike makers don't exactly focus on affordable 
bikes either.

John, I can only agree that we don't need any more forms of enclosed, 
dehumanizing transportation.  I believe that our bicycles encompass all 
that is right with humanity, especially because it means we can more 
easily communicate with others. It's all the more unfortunate that too 
many of the road users are enclosed and isolated.

There's a television commerical lately, showing humans launching into 
the air, powered by "jet packs" of oatmeal breakfast cereal. At least 
these humans are fully exposed, un-enclosed, but it would still be crazy!

(By the way, Tesla is an "it", not a "he". Nikola Tesla 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla, the famous inventor from whom Tesla 
Motors http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors borrowed the name, is long dead 
and has nothing to do with the Tesla cars, other than that they use AC 
(alternating current) motors rather than the DC (direct current) motors favoured 
by his rival Edison.)

But let's get away from cars and just think about acceleration. Whether bikes, 
motorcycles, cars or "non-vehicular" sports like skiing, there is no doubt that 
people *like* to accelerate and are prepared to pay ridiculous amounts of money 
for the priviledge.

Acceleration is available force divided by total mass (a=F/m) and available 
force is available power divided by the speed at this instant (F=P/v). Therefore 
a=P/(m*v). Examining this equation, we see that in the first instant when 
accererating from zero, very high accerations are possible with little power. It 
also helps if the mass is low and for the intitial acceleration you must have a 
great deal of force available. Now human bodies and also electric motors are 
very good at applying large forces briefly, whereas internal combustion engines 
are poor at this. For this reason, i.c. engines are always overpowered by a 
great deal, at least a factor of ten. The alternative, a quickly-acting 
wide-range CVT (continuously variable transmission) is expensive and rarely 
strong enough at the low speed end.

For the reasons above, cycles, especially very light ones, can initially 
accelerate more quickly than motor vehicles. It is this feeling which motivates 
people to spend a lot for lightweight constructions in carbon, titanium and 
magnesium. Presumably fixed-gear bikes are also gaining in popularity because 
this feeling is even more direct. Ordinary cycles suffer from having to change 
gears while accelerating just like cars. (Side note: in my opinion recumbents 
aren't as popular as racing bikes because the acceleration is the wrong way 
around: you have to push *against* the direction of motion; with a racing bike 
the direction is at least at approximately right angles; a supine vehicle would 
have it right, but is otherwise less practical.)

Electric vehicles can however get away with no mechnical gearing and electric 
motors are more powerful than either humans or combustion motors. Therefore if 
the batteries weren't so heavy, they would offer more acceleration than the 
others - and also regenerative deceleration. With advanced batteries and careful 
optimisation it is possible to get high acceleration anyway. This is probably 
what the Tesla car concept is about - a toy to compete with the other toys.

Getting back to bikes, we have several electric bikes and an electric 
motorcycle. This Peugeot ScootElec is very enjoyable to ride in urban 
conditions; it initially accelerates more quickly than similar petrol scooters 
and is better in most other respects other than range. However they don't sell 
well at all because the manufacturers prefer to advertise their petrol models 
which give them higher profits.

The vehicle I enjoy riding most is my Velocity Dolphin ebike because it combines 
all the best points described above. The moderately powered (250W) motor is 
geared through a planetary differential with the pedals in a pseudo-CVT setup 
which allows accelerating from zero to speed without changing gear. Even better, 
the pedal sensor gives a servo-feeling, so you think you are accelerating 
yourself. In effect, you are getting the performance of an athlete without being 
one and without frequent gear changes. The Dolphin unfortuantely doesn't offer 
regen braking like my wife's recumbent BionX. This also has a totally different 
pedal feeling to it. Both feelings aren't optimal, but I gather the present top 
models of Swiss ebikes (both the Dolphin successor whatever it's called and the 
Flyer) have got it about right - unfortunately without regen braking.

Following from my last message, we really want something which offers almost 
instant acceleration like in computer games, and so that we may enjoy this over 
and over, near instant deceleration and lots of stop signs!

Thus there is some rational for designing the best possible regenerative braking 
setup even though it is purely about feelings and not practical transportation. 
I believe if such vehicles could be built at affordable prices, they could 
displace quite a few car trips.

I also believe that such performance, especially when coupled to pedals, would 
allow "kicks" at lower speed levels and might reduce the many deaths caused by 
boy racer types with their cars.

This is where the extremely fast charging high efficiency batteries
would be really useful. Ideally you'd have a battery just big enough
to get you from whoa to go a couple of times and a very light
motor/generator. That way you could regen into stop signs then power
out of them, obeying the law and not suffering too much of a penalty.

I think aqatic motorists are worse than land motorists. However the conflicts 
are less because in general there is much more space.

Regarding cycling, the problem is that vehicles can have different roles 
depending on their environment and speed. A fast confident cyclist is definately 
a "road vehicle" while the same person can easily mingle with the pedistrians in 
a pedestrian zone by adopting a lower speed and different attitude. Non-cyclists 
don't understand this very well. They also don't understand the great 
superiority of cycles in traffic awareness and control, which allows manoeuvres 
which to non-cyclists or even casual cyclists seem foolhardy.

But of course cyclists aren't better people than motorists and don't really 
behave any better. Indeed, perhaps not having any training and less likely to 
"get caught" they will often behave worse. But what motorists and traffic 
planners have got to realise is that it is different if you endanger yourself 
than to if you endanger others. Cycles are much less likely to endanger others 
even when breaking various traffic laws than cars are even when obeying them.

I've been skimming the regen thread, but must confess that I haven't 
read every message.

But this leads to a simple question:

Has anyone performed actual real-life testing of regenerative braking 
and do they have quantitative results?

- such as riding a specific route  with regen off, measuring the results 
and then repeating the test with regen on ?

I'm curious because my personal experience of  riding my non-electrified 
recumbent through moderate hills and suburban environments is that I 
just don't use the brakes much at all, so if I were electrified, regen 
wouldn't provide any practical benefit.

The theory and postulation are very interesting, but does anyone have 
real-life numbers ?

I agree that Tesla Motors has taken a "gear-head" approach, but as  
with HPV's .... if you lack scale of production the best bet is to aim  
for the highest end of the marketplace.

A local company has taken a more sensible approach, in some ways  
taking advantage of the learning that has occurred in HPV and Mileage  
competitions.

I was thinking the same thing. Much more efficient to accelerate the human 
and their seat than the entire car. Some kind of virtual reality setup, with 
a little bit of possible "real world sport" improvements for marketing 
purposes, would be much more efficient. Link it to what is really happening 
with the car, but exaggerate it. I can see being able to download programs 
for all kinds of race cars and fighter planes and things like that.

Not sure I want a lot more drivers "in their own little world", though. 
Seems like there is a lot of that going on already...

Chris:

You must have missed the first messages in this discussion.  Theo Schmidt
and I posted URL links to accounts of regenerative braking tests conducted
by different people, using different bikes on different courses, both
anecdotal.  I've reposted this at the botttom.

In summary, the effect of regen. braking varies from zero to something in
the mid-40 percent range, depending on circumstances.  Most people who
have tried this on a typical course get something between 5 and 15%
recovery when riding normally but using the motor as a brake/generator
instead of a friction brake.

One needs to ask if increasing the mechanical complexity of the motor
system with a clutch or restricting oneself to the use of a non-geared hub
motor and of adapting one's riding style when descending hills and/or
dealing with urban traffic to minimize energy lost to air
resistance--keeping speed moderate (e.g. 15mph) so that energy can be
recaptured by the battery is a worthwhile alternative to using a similarly
larger battery?

Descending a hill at terminal velocity, braking only where necessary to
negotiate turns and other obstacles is the payback for climbing the hill
and closest one gets to (controlled) flying on a bicycle.  Efficient use
of regenerative braking would give up most of this enjoyment.

The new lithium compounds are very close to what we're talking about, but
still not even close without capacitors, and probably needs too many of them
to be practical. 

A more recent advance is getting charge times down to 10-20 seconds but that
isn't the current formulation and is a manufacturing advance due to a better
understanding of how charging takes place. This advance is what's needed,
but you'll still need capacitors.

With the 10-20 second range you can take what's captured by the capacitors
that charge almost instantly and feed it to the batteries before it's leaked
out to give an overall system efficiency way better than 15%-20%.

If you can't capture the current spike from braking hard to a stop ... 

The power loss from the cap's over time is the problem, they don't hold a
charge worth beans, 10-20 seconds is in the ballpark but that's only with
the new mfg technique, 3-4 years down the line or so.

Yes, but to see it you'll need to buy the relevant back issue of A to
B. I expect that any review of the BionX will mention it, but whether
they do a decent test is anyone's guess.

http://www.atob.org.uk/Electric_Buyers%27_Guide.html

BionX  ***
Estimated kit price ?845
The BionX is available either as a kit for fitting to a normal bike, or as a complete machine. It's the first regenerative system to become widely available, but STILL not launched in the UK, despite numerous promises, allegedly because the French Canadian manufacturer is difficult to deal with. The bike not only supplies power, but can 'recycle' it on descents and when slowing down. It relies on complex electronics to do this (which always makes us nervous), but it has many good features - near silent operation, reasonable range and reduced brake wear (the motor does most of the braking). On the negative side, range can be limited if you don't 'drive' the system carefully, and hill-climbing is not very good.
We carried out a full review of the BionX system in A to B 45, see A to B Back Numbers

The above links to a graph I made in Oct 2006 of an upright bicycle, 
using an iBike data logger and spreadsheet program for the post-ride 
analysis.

The graph's primary purpose is to depict how the Force due to 
acceleration (F accel) varies in response to changes in road slope and 
natural wind speed.  It's useful to regard Fa as a vector with direction 
relative to forward motion indicated by  a positive or negative sign. 
Thus the force due to acceleration serves as either a propulsive force 
or as an additional source of drag.  In this particular example, IIRC 
there had been no active use of the brakes.

You probably know this, but...

That's where capacitors differ from batteries.  Capacitors can be
charged and discharged at much higher rates but have lower
capacities (per weight and per volume).

Ultracapacitors are commonly referenced in electric car design
papers- they can have larger charge/discharge rates than batteries
and better store more power per weight and volume than capacitors.

I'd like that.

And if you can do that at a stop sign, you can probably to it at a
red-light or a small hill.

This guy built a 4000watt assist:

  http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/shumaker/default.htm

Discussion here:

  http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/power-assist/message/72313

Obviously this design is not directly good for our discussion since
it has such high gearing (i.e. poor regen) but it does demonstrate
that there it is possible to produce high power in a small package
at a low duty cycle.

Personally, I want a clutch mechanism on my as yet hypothetical
velomobile so I can pedal into the regen braking mechanism
while waiting at the red light and bank up enough energy so I can
be back at cruise speed quickly when the light goes green.

Chris,

I've performed real world tests with my 250 Watt Bionx with Lithium Ion batteries, but I do not have precise quantitative results.  If I only use the lowest level of assist and only on the last mile of my 6.7 mile ride to work and then use the regen setting of 2 or higher for the 4+ miles of downhill on the way home, I can ride every day without ever having to charge the battery.  In this mode, I only save about 5 minutes from my total commute time, but I am much more likely to ride knowing that I do not have to supply all the power to climb the 457 feet in the final mile to work.  Coming out of work, I can go 30 mph or better with the full regen braking on the big hill right by where I work.  On the other hills I can set the regen level to 2 and go better than 15 mph.  I do not know how the numbers in the diagnostic mode on the system correspond to standard units.  When it says my regen level is "20" or "40", I think it is just a number on a scale that Bionx set up.  The settings on the Bionx systems can vary.  My max regen is set to "45".  It can be set higher.  This is useless in flatter settings and might be overload on the system with my long 10% grade hill.  My system serves me well, but I live close to the foothills South West of Denver and ride up into the foothills to go to work.  I have a gross elevation gain of 1000 feet between home and work (a net elevation gain of 700 ft.).  For my situation, the regen works well.  I don't think it would work as well in flatter areas, but there you could go a lot further on a single charge anyway.

I often use my 5 pound 2.3 kg ultra light E assist on my ultra light Velomobile (47 lbs, 21kg) for "adequate" acceleration up to cruising speed 20 mph 32 kph. An ideal speed for HPV type vehicles.  
However when I'm using the vehicle for running local errands I often limit assist use because my bodies health depends on getting enough daily exercise. When your old you need to maintain a certain level of exercise. So using an assist for too much acceleration or in a more continuous fashion can be detrimental in many ways. We have a lot of overweight and in poor health people here in the states. 

I'm talking about local travel because here because we don't have the infrastructure for longer distance commuting.

around: you have to push *against* the direction of motion; 
....I often eat up-rights on acceleration from a stop to 15 mph, 24kph on my unfaired FWD recumbent.  After 15 they can put out more and longer term power.

John your observation is supported by the formula for Energy.  Energy 
can be depicted most simply by Energy (E) being a Force (F) moved 
through a distance (s);

E = F * s

By reintroducing the basic depictions  for Force and acceleration ( 
F=m*a, and  a = dV/t) the Energy formula can be rewritten as;

E = m * dV/t  * s

Thus, from your example of increasing time (t) by a factor of 3, the 
amount of Energy used would be decreased to a third of what it had been. 
The value of dV in the formula need not change, hence the achieved 
maximum velocity can remain the same.

Good for you, John!!! 

Our physical and cognitive well-being depend on getting sufficient 
physical exercise.  Bicycling is not enough by itself to supply the 
needed weight bearing exercise to promote good bone density. Pedestrian 
travel supplies the most accessible weight bearing activity for most 
people and can be included as part of cycling. This can be done by 
choosing on purpose to travel over hilly routes or other otherwise 
challenging situations that will include pushing the bicycle. One can 
even consider forgoing the bike for some trips or chores.

Here are a few links about bone density and bicycling:

Hi Folks,

It's time to shake off the Winter doldrums and celebrate Human Power 
(and the Spring!!!)

The '09 New England HPV Rally will be held on Saturday, May 9, 2009 in 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire in conjunction with the Portsmouth 
Sustainability Fair.  Details can be found on the events page at 
www.wildfirehpv.com

If previous events are any guide, we should have a good range of 
different human powered vehicles, including commercially built and 
homebuilt velomobiles, human/electric hybrids (past events included a 
solar powered upright built mostly from junk!) and a wide range of 
different recumbents.

Last years Sustainability Fair was a pretty big draw (1400 attendees) 
with lots of interesting things to see and do, and this years fair 
promises to be even bigger and better. 

So it should be a great time and well worth it.

Hope to see you there!

Best,
-Ethan

.....Thanks John for the URLs. 

I do walk quite a bit, and do a range of other exercise such as shoveling snow, raking leaves, digging in the garden, and cutting wood for my stove all with hand tools.

John Snyder asserted:

> a = dV/t

Methinks you forgot a d: a = dV/dt.

Easier might be, E = 0.5*m*v*v.  Notice we don't need no steenkin 't'.

Else I smell a perpetual motion machine!  Further symbol manipulation in
support of this breakthrough is LTTR.

The formula for Kinetic Energy (KE = 0.5 * m * v *v) says the same as E 
= Fs when Vo = 0.0 m/s..

Little "t" was the center of attention. John Tetz suggested an example 
of looking at an eBike's change of velocity lasting  6 seconds (t') 
compared to 18 seconds (t").  The moves and pieces  were; F = m*a, a = 
(Vf - Vo)/t , dV = (Vf-Vo), and E = F*s which together allow showing 
time in the formula for Energy, as E = m * dV/t  * s.   Using the 
inputs; m' = m", s' = s", dV' = dV", t' = 6 seconds and t" = 18 seconds 
will give the result  E' = 3*E".  (see ref)

This perspective gives support to the following statement made by Tetz;

No new technologies involved, just an application of patience and 
regarding one's Joules as valuable . <wink>
