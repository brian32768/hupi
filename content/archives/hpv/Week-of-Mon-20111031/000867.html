<PRE>I could use some input.  This is a bit offbeat, but probably interesting 
to lovers of workbikes.

Being a tourist town, Austin has a lot of pedicabs in it.  I like 
pedicabs, as I like it when people use bikes for practical purposes, and 
I like big workbikes/trikes in general.  Like many, I'm leery of 
&quot;pedicabs&quot; which are large trailers (always without their own brakes) 
whose gross, loaded weight far exceeds that of the mountain bike and 
rider towing it by the seatpost.  Known trailer crashes include 
jackknifing when the bike brakes during a turn, seatpost failure, or 
falls when the rider is unable to climb with the load.  A trailer costs 
about 1/10 of what a new, purpose-built trike does but it can be leased 
out at the same rate as a trike pedicab, so they are flooding the local 
market, hurting operators (not so much owners/lessors).

Most cities with pedicabs don't allow trailer pedicabs, but Austin 
hasn't set such rules yet.  The city is in the process of revising all 
its pedicab laws in response to the explosion of cabs downtown and 
around the University of Texas football games.  This has set off a lot 
of internal politics in the industry as the tricycle-pedicab companies 
(mostly small independents, a few medium sized operations and one big 
company) are trying to get the city to restrict the use, or at least 
growth, of trailer-pedicabs.

The most compelling argument for the public is safety.  The problem 
making this argument is that since so few cities allow trailer pedicabs, 
there is very little data.  Pedicabbies working on the streets see 
trailer crashes, but the drunken chuckleheads dumped on the street 
aren't much interested on police or ambulances.  I heard a report of a 
passenger's broken arm (trailer jackknifed stopping for a surprise 
pedestrian in a fast right turn), but even such reported crashes, with 
injuries, get filed by the police with other &quot;bike crashes.&quot;  It is hard 
to point to statistics.  I might intuitively consider it dangerous, but 
convincing the city against resistance from trailer companies requires 
better proof.  Documented crashes nationwide are inevitably on 
tricycle-pedicabs since they are 99% of what operates.

Some independent tricycle operators know me since I work on their rigs.  
They asked if I could render an expert opinion on the unfitness of an 
ordinary bike towing a trailer thrice its weight.  While I consider such 
a contraption dubious in the extreme, I can't claim expertise just being 
a bike dealer.  I'm not an engineer, or a builder.  I don't even sell 
upright bikes. They might ask other shops, but I suspect a LBS would be 
unwilling to stick their necks out.  Wanting to help in the cause of 
good-equipment over cheap-equipment, I offered instead to find others in 
the industry who would know more about the hazards of putting a bicycle 
to this kind of use.

Any suggestions?  I've got a few ideas, but no solid leads.  Calling 
around on the phone isn't my specialty, but I'll do it.  Trailer makers 
probably have studied it.  Makers of seatposts probably have some number 
related to forces on their parts.  Bike makers might be able to state 
their concerns about the safety of their bikes put to this purpose, but 
probably don't do actual tests of their bike's unfitness for wacky jobs 
like that.  And then who might be willing to stick their necks out?

Does anyone here know of scientific studies covering the dynamics of 
oversized trailers' effects on bicycles?  Or know of someone in the bike 
industry or bike science that might?.  Any documentation needs to get to 
the city by the Nov. 16th.
