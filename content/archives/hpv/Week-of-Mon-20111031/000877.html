Exactly. But when carrying passengers for hire I'd expect a little
more than &quot;the rider has to pay attention&quot;. My limited experience
with seatpost hitch trailers has been somewhat scary. With any real
load they start to take control of the bike. For this reason I have
never built such a trailer nor would I use one if there was an
alternative.

I have enough trouble towing 100kg in a two wheel trailer attached
to the rear axle of the bike. It's very easy for the trailer to lift
the rear wheel off the ground on bumps unless the bike has heavy
panniers as well. And stopping requires considerable caution.

The trike pedicabs are much more stable and easy to handle. Even in
the hands of idiots (it gets boring, so we play games like &quot;do figure
8's on two wheels with another rider in the passenger seat&quot;). The
main problem we have is riders forgetting just how wide the trikes
are (they seat two passengers side by side). They go through narrow
gaps and crunch up the trikes. But yes, good brakes and sensible
design makes the three wheelers great. They're ~$AUS4000 from memory.
I can't imagine building a trailer would be much easier, you would
probably save $1000 by not having gears or brakes, but the rest of
it would be the same. I hope...

I have a four wheel trailer with inertia brakes on the front wheels
that is 1m wide by 2.4m long and has carried ~500kg. I tow it behind
my four wheel loadbike. Between the disk brakes on all four wheels
of the quad and the V brakes on the trailer it stops pretty well.
The four wheelers makes all the difference to safety. It's hard to
tip the quad over, and the inertia brakes do most of the stopping
with lightweight loads. 500kg is very hard to pull, but I found it
quite controllable (I also had ~120kg on the quad plus my 80kg.
And I have experience driving large trucks... it handles like a
truck in that situation. An old, underpowered truck :).

That trailer is not legal for carrying people in Australia (it's
a flatbed anyway), and is possibly not a legal bike trailer at all
(the law doesn't mention this design, only the permitted axle
overhangs, but always uses the singular form of &quot;axle&quot; where
that trailer has four axles - one per wheel, just like many two
wheel trailers). I have never been hassled by the Police, but
they have waved at me as I go past.

&gt;<i> The 15 m long, 1 m wide
</I>&gt;<i> vehicles are officially accepted and insurable as &quot;bicycles&quot; by the
</I>&gt;<i> local police and indeed most places in Switzerland, but this is mainly
</I>&gt;<i> because there are no specific laws prohibiting them
</I>
This sounds completely unlike the stereotype of the Swiss. &quot;there is no
law prohibiting it&quot; is the sort of reason I'd expect in New Zealand,
not in Switzerland. Surely you're more organised than that :)
