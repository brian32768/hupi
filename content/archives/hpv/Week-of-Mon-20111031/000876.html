</I>I think it is obvious that a heavy trailer cannot be ridden the same way 
as a light one. It boils down to speed, gradient, common sense and 
experience. My heaviest usual load is about 60 kg apples nicely balanced 
on a traditional trailer attached to the seat post. The trailer weighs 
20 kg, I weigh 80 kg and my electric bike weighs 35 kg. I can safely 
ride 30 km/h if it is flat and straight and no sudden stops likely. I 
can ride down a steep (about 1:5) hill and around sharp bends, but then 
slow down to 10 km/h. I have at times carried people in the trailer, and 
this is perfectly safe in good conditions, but I would obviouisly avoid 
steep gradients and high speeds.

Heavy farm trailers attached by a ball-and-socket to the seat post are 
traditional in Switzerland. I don't think there is much regulation 
except the width which mustn't exceed 1 m, and possibly a weight limit 
of 80 or 100 kg. Passenger-carrying is not allowed (except children), 
but as soon as the passengers can pedal themselves, I guess the trailers 
are considered part of the vehicle and tolerated.

In Thun we have a tourist amenity called the Thuner Trampelwurm. See 
<A HREF="http://www.trampelwurm.ch.">http://www.trampelwurm.ch.</A> There is also an article in an old &quot;Human 
Power&quot;. It is a trike with *ten* trailers! I ride this occasionally. 
With ten people we limit the speed to 10 km/h, 15 is just possible 
before the trailers start to jackknife. With just two or four trailers, 
there is no problem going at 20 km/h. The slightest gradients are a big 
problem (when empty), as the complete vehicle weighs over 500 kg. There 
are automatic brakes on all trailers, but they don't really seem to 
work, so we have hydraulic brakes on the trike and first two trailers. 
This is adequate in dry conditions. In wet conditions the drivers have 
to be super-careful and go really slowly if there is any chance of 
having to brake.
&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> The most compelling argument for the public is safety.  The problem 
</I>&gt;<i> making this argument is that since so few cities allow trailer 
</I>&gt;<i> pedicabs, there is very little data.
</I>Our &quot;Centipedal&quot; has been going for 15 years. There are 4 of the 
vehicles and thousands of trips have been done. There are plenty of 
minor &quot;accidents&quot;, mainly catching &quot;street furniture&quot; with one of the 
last trailers, as a 90 degree turn lets the last trailer trail inside by 
25 cm, and the drivers sometimes forget this. Sometimes the wheels fold, 
as they are really inadequate for going around corners with heavy 
people. There is no problem in heavy traffic and amoungst pedestrians. 
When the drivers go too fast or the passengers pedal too hard, the rear 
trailers sway and jackknife. Annoying, but there have never been any 
serious injuries and only very few minor ones. The 15 m long, 1 m wide 
vehicles are officially accepted and insurable as &quot;bicycles&quot; by the 
local police and indeed most places in Switzerland, but this is mainly 
because there are no specific laws prohibiting them and the vehicles 
were run for some years by the city of Thun itself. However the city of 
Winterthur banned them once and was reprimanded by the police dept. of 
Thun on Swiss TV! If there are ever serious accidents or the 
&quot;Health&amp;Safety&quot; attitudes get more extreme, I expect that they will no 
longer be able to use the roads. So we do our best to train the drivers 
to drive sensibly.
