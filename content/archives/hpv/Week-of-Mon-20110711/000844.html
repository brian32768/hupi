<PRE>Hi, all...

I've been using 20 x 1.35 and 26 x 1.35 tires on my Vision R55. I've 
generally used Vredestein S-licks (now discontinued) or Schwalbe 
Kojaks (which develop a lot of nicks and cracks).

To deal with frequent punctures, I tried a set of Schwalbe Marathon 
Plus(es). Very heavy -- around 775 gr. But I did not get any flats at all.

However, my legs felt like concrete. My speed went down about 15%. 
Riding up any rise became a chore. I thought it was my age, but I 
swapped the Kojaks back, with extra rubber tubing in the vital spots, 
and my speed has gone way up along with my enjoyment.

I'm thinking of getting a pair of Primo Comets with a Kevlar belt 
under the tread. Though they do make a 20 x 1.35, they don't make a 
26 x 1.35. But they do make both a 20 x 1.50 and a 26 x 1.50.  They 
pretty much slicks, and they seem to be somewhat puncture resistant.

So, does anyone have any experience with these tires?

Would it be okay to mix and match -- a 20 x 1.35 front and a 26 x 
1.50 rear -- or would it be best to go with the 1.50 widths for both? 
(I'm assuming that the tires would fit on my current rims).

Thanks in advance. I'm looking forward to your input.
