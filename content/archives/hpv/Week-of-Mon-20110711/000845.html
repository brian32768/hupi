Yes, I've been using Schwalbe Kojaks on my commute bike for the past 1.5 years and on a previous commute bike several years ago used Primo Comet Kevlar belted tyres. I find the rate of punctures and general durability on the Kojaks to be similar to the Comet Kevlars but the Kojaks have better traction on wet roads and the folding bead version of the Kojaks I'm using is lighter weight than the Comets which are only available with wire beads.

&gt;<i> Would it be okay to mix and match -- a 20 x 1.35 front and a 26 x 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.50 rear -- or would it be best to go with the 1.50 widths for both? 
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm assuming that the tires would fit on my current rims).
</I>
The proposed setup would work and both widths of Comets will fit your current rims. Due to the weight distribution and impact loading characteristics of a bike with the layout of a Vision R55, ideally the smaller diameter front tyre would be wider than the larger diameter rear tyre which doesn't receive as much impact loading when going over potholes and such. So one possibility would be running the wider 40-406 version of the Comet up front and the 40-559 Comet in the rear. Another possibility would be running the narrower 37-406 Comet in front and a 32-559 Primo Racer in the rear. The Primo Racer has an identical tread and construction to the Primo Comet, it is just a different name used for the 32-559 and 25-559 versions of the 40-559 Comet. I don't know why they named those widths &quot;Racer&quot; and all their other tyres with this tread and casing design &quot;Comet&quot;.
