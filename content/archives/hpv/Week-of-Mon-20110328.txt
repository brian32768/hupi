Subject: [hpv] Patent Reference for Bevo-Bike
Message-ID: <B72B1EBB125A4EE2B0432F7BB17754F5@centrecoe26be8>

Hi

I'm doing some writing and would like to find the patent number for the German front-wheel drive Bevo Bike.  The reference I have (Encycleopedia 4, page 104) mentions "the front-wheel drive system is patented under the name "Top-Drive" but I can't find any reference to it under sites like espacenet, the European patents site.

Thanks for your help, Regards

Steve Nurse
