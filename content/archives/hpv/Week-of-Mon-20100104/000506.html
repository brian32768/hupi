<PRE>Hi

During last year I self-published a book about Human Powered Vehicles.  My bike building has spanned over more than 20 years and I wanted to share some of my experience of the more exotic types of bikes and HPV's with others. The result of several years of work is &quot;An Illustrated Guide to the Cycle Zoo&quot;.

Webpage for the book is here, <A HREF="http://www.modularbikes.com.au/book/">http://www.modularbikes.com.au/book/</A> , for many the quickest way to get a copy is through ebay, a worldwide search for &quot;cycle zoo&quot; on your local ebay site should find the listing.

Recently I have added value to the book by providing some on-line material including plans of bikes I've made. A few list members already have the book I'm sure, any comments / questions /opinions?

Best Wishes
