The front brakes on my 20/26 Stealth work much better with the cable
entering from the left. The only brakes I've used that accommodate this
routing easily are Odyssey A-brakes, now out of production. Would anyone
care to recommend another "ambidextrous" brake (e.g., the Odyssey Evo
2?) or a better term for this type of routing than "ambidextrous"?

M5 brakes work.  They are easy to switch to left-side-pull.  Very nice
brakes, but very expensive.  A lot more than those old Odysseys.

Any chance that a PTR record could be put into DNS for the mail server
that hosts hpv at hupi.org?  Its IP is 72.9.228.218 and there is no reverse
DNS for it, so my SpamAssassin, by dint of its Botnet plug-in, thinks
some of the list mail is spam because it's coming from a host that
doesn't look like a real mail server and might be part of a botnet.  The
last post from Mike at easystreetrecumbents.com landed in my spam
bucket.

The server's ISP should be able to arrange a PTR record.

I'm using an Oval Concepts Aero front brake mounted on the back of the fork.
It is a caliper brake that can be configured for cable entry on either
side.  Its out of production but there are still some around. Mine was $65
at Universal Cycle.

This is quite fascinating. As a small wheel bike enthusiast from the  
time of the late sixties ( I had an early sixteen inch wheeled Silk  
folder from Japan) I tried to reason out why the reduced gyroscopic  
forces didn't make for its poor handling as much as did the general  
loosey-goosey connections  with which it folded. I was introduced to  
the steering trail idea when I discussed this with others, and took  
that to be the basic mechanism. This test buck that they created makes  
me think that another thought I had at that time might have some  
validity. What went through my mind was the idea of balancing a broom  
on one's finger tip. Standing still it is just a matter of moving the  
finger in the direction of the incipient fall and with a bit of  
overcorrection it begins to fall in the opposite direction, but when  
one moves forward at a steady pace one creates a vector force that  
doesn't seem to need to be fully corrected until one tries to stop in  
place. i.e. it is allowed to fall forward  and is only corrected for  
neutral rate of fall and left/right bias in that fall.

Now that I think about their test buck a little more it seems that the  
weight adjustment beam with its mass hanging forward of the steering  
axis creates a ballistic trajectory that the two-wheel system must  
follow even if the (somewhat) gyro neutralized front wheel pair has  
negative trail.  If the "handlebar" ends are not accelerated  in one  
direction of rotation or the other enough to flip around to positive  
trail they act as mass dampers to keep the trail negative. As well the  
rear wheel's drag gives trail to the whole assembly.

I await any correction of my (possibly) misguided thoughts from better  
minds than my own.

I didn't realise they had added a gyro as well - I thought the idea was to
once again show that gyro effects are negligible. But yeah, trying it with
a gyro makes sense, in the hope that the "not convinced by all this
science stuff" crowd will see it actually make no difference to a real
bike and change their minds. I think someone should write a Snopes article
on this.

In lay person's terms, a bike with a big front wheel feels "more  
stable" than a bike with a small front wheel.  They attribute this to  
gyroscopic effect. Then people say that doesn't enter in and say, the  
geometry is wrong on the small wheel bike, then this study says it  
isn't geometry either...  ;-)

Gyroscopic effect may not be the determinant of stability for a  
riderless bike, but it may affect the feel of a bike with a rider.   
Seems like rotating mass is going to have _some_ effect somewhere.

Patterson had this effect factored into his model, and I don't know why they
are referencing Ruina.  Increased trail means more fork flop,less
sensitivity, and more stability.  Raising the center gravity just increases
longitudinal rotational moment of inertia. This means the angular
acceleration is less, and you do not go down as fast when you lose tire
traction.  It also means that there is more time for the stabilizing
feedback effect from the trail induced front wheel direction change that
acts to counter the heeling angle of the bike.  

The bottom line is the higher you are the more time you have for recovery
when you lose traction (your angular acceleration is less), and given an
effective amount of trail the more stable you are. Bents fix the loss of
longitudinal moment of inertia by increasing the trail, and of course the
annoying fork flop that goes along with it.  

The lower you are to the ground the faster you go down, and the reason why
is very simple. Trail is very important on a recumbent.  They basically do
not work without it.

The current model Lightning Phantom which replaced the Stealth uses a  
Tektro linear-pull front brake that has the cable enter from the left  
side.
