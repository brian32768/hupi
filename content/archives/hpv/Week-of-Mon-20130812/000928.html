<PRE>I've talked with reps from IGUS about using sleeve bearings for headsets and they seem they may work for the job, self-lubricating and with a slight break-in they should be loose enough to ride no hands, he was somewhat a rider so knew what I was talking about enough to feel if I had a shop to make custom races would do it, stiction seemed it wouldn't be an issue to him &amp; I was referencing Campy, to me there is mass contact area if truly stiction is minimal, my project a tt frame and trying to use 1&quot; for the headtube; here's a mt. bike using them: <A HREF="http://www.igus.com/wpck/default.aspx?pagenr=8238&amp;C=US&amp;L=en">http://www.igus.com/wpck/default.aspx?pagenr=8238&amp;C=US&amp;L=en</A>

p.s. a picture of my recently finished road frame design built by A. Cooper, Cooper Works Cycle his home Chandler, AZ, based on an art frame I did that rode really well and looked alive, this one called Coyote, rides very smooth, tracks really well any speed and low drag even without the fancy  wheels ... <A HREF="http://www.mallard-design.com/mdc2010/media/coyote-c005.jpg">http://www.mallard-design.com/mdc2010/media/coyote-c005.jpg</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Why not bushings? &quot;Stiction&quot; (STarting frICTION) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The tiny, subconscious corrections you are always making to balance a bike require little or no friction at the start. With a bushing the force needed to initiate the movement would initially be high then suddenly drop off.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My Raleigh Twenty folder has a bushing replacing the top bearing, with a conventional lower headset bearing.  With a steep head angle and a steerer almost as long as the blades, this is as favorable an application for a bushing as you are likely to find.  I find it &quot;tolerable&quot; but many who use their Twenties more than I do have converted with an Aheadset type upper bearing. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH the Greenspeed trikes get by with bushings as they don't have to be balanced.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of the things I've pondered over the years is, &quot;Why do we use ball or roller bearings in head sets?&quot;  Nothing is rotating more than a couple degrees ( more than 90% of the time) plus or minus, and a good shock through the wheel into the fork can cause indentation of the balls into the races.  Use a bushing and you spread forces over infinitely larger bearing surfaces than the contact area of balls/races.  In the case of MBB FWD, bushings have the added advantage of extra drag dampening some pedal induced oscillation.
