Yup, I'm on the list, although I just now realized there was a receiver 
mounted rack sub-thread here...

Basically if it rides on 2 or 3 wheels Atoc can put it on your car. We have 
Topper racking solutions for all 2 wheelers and Draftmaster solutions for 
all 2 or 3 wheelers. The only exception at this time being recumbent tandem 
trikes like the Greenspeed GTT.

The HP Velotechnik Speed Machine is no problem. It will fit on a Draftmaster 
without the need for a Specialty Rail.
