Kathy,

you may rent a bike at Citybike in Vienna:

http://www.citybike.at/vermietung.htm

I do not know these guys. So it is up to you to check them out.

BTW it is easy to travel by train in Europe, so to go to the  
www.Spezialradmesse.de you may take the night train e.g. to Switzerland.
 From there, it is not that far by train to Germersheim.

One of the best sites to plan train trips in Europe is:
www.sbb.ch

If you're in Austria, www.oebb.at is closer.

Best regards - Andreas (in Switzerland, but my wife is from Vienna)

On the Burke-Gilman bike trail in Seattle, which I commute  like an auto-Sisyphus on my Challenge Hurricane, I have several intersections at which the combination of parked cars and my chosen position for my sensory apparatus leads to uncertainty and danger.  So, my idle mind (10 miles each way) has drifted toward a possibly silly solution:  a fisheye camera mounted on the front of my fairing with a screen on my USS bars.  Like a switch-back mirror, if I see movement I would be made aware of a conflict and can take measures.  

Well, backup camera kits are about $50-150+, so maybe I'll give it a try, just for curiosity's sake.  These car systems are heavy, bulky and 12 v, so far from ideal for a bike, but no reason other than market size to prevent miniature systems compatible with bike dynamos.

Sorry Tony, but my $400 iphone mounted on the nose of my fairing?  Not happening!  And I couldn't see the screen well enough anyway.

Or you could put a fisheye lens like the fotojojo ones on a smartphone.  Not that I have any direct experience with that product (yet), I've only just heard about it on the NY Times TechTimes podcast.

Also a trip-recording app like Dailyroads Voyager might give you valuable evidence in case of an accident (you or someone else).  But I can't wholeheartedly endorse this particular one yet- I've only just installed it and don't plan to use it much until I have a good mount for my smartphone.

But Dailyroads Voyager does display at the same time it records, and it records either stills or video clips, and it retains them on demand or on detection of a certain amount of G-force, and I would think a mounting for a smartphone at the head of your vehicle might do what you need with less weight and mounting complexity.  If battery life is not an issue (I charge my phone at both ends of my trips so it's not for me)

I see where you're going now.  But I do want to use it while under way:  as I cross a street between parked cars.  I'll have to think about it.

You have a fairing on the front of your Challenge Hurricane? I'd like  
to see a photo of that. I've never seen a front fairing on a  
Hurricane. That might be part of your vision problem right there. The  
fairing may be getting in the way of leaning forward to scan around  
parked cars at intersections. When I'm riding a low, laid back bike  
in traffic I lean forward in these situations to look around. Hard to

You can see my bike at

You're right that I cannot lean forward with this set up. It'll be even worse when I achieve my eventual goal of enclosing the gap on the bike to make it more weatherproof and streamlined.

You have a fairing on the front of your Challenge Hurricane? I'd like to see a photo of that. I've never seen a front fairing on a Hurricane. That might be part of your vision problem right there. The fairing may be getting in the way of leaning forward to scan around parked cars at intersections. When I'm riding a low, laid back bike in traffic I lean forward in these situations to look around. Hard to do with the tiller steering common on Hurricanes but easy with USS or U-shaped OSS sometimes referred to as "open cockpit", "tweaners" or "superman bars".

"Well, backup camera kits are about $50-150+, so maybe I'll give it a 
try, just for curiosity's sake.? These car systems are heavy, bulky and 
12 v, so far from ideal for a bike, but no reason other than market size to prevent miniature systems compatible with bike dynamos."??

Lets assume the bike in question is worth over $ 1,000 .
Go self contained 

There are probably bluetooth? "spy" cameras you can use with your phone as a viewer.
If not:

GoPro.com ? 

Has waterproof cameras with multiple mounting accessories for? the bike, helmet, surfboard etc..
The most inexpensive one is one is $99 SD. HD cameras are $ 299
For another $79:

"The LCD BacPac is a detachable LCD screen for your 1080p HD HERO camera. As a removable accessory, the LCD BacPac keeps your camera as small and light as possible, yet provides the convenience of an LCD screen when 
attached."

The question is can the LCD BacPac work remotely with some kind of extension wire/cable

Best of luck? !

The 12v part is an easy work around with all the lithium hobby batteries
available :)

Hi All

A few weeks ago, OzHPV (Australia) held our annual Challenge event.  This event is very family and all - abilities friendly and includes shorter races that have everyday relavence for HPV's on the road like a Go to Whoa, Shopping Race and slalom event.  Successful and enjoyable and a pleasant time was had by all.  I have collated some of the links to photos and videos on the event and they are here http://modularbikes.blogspot.com/2011/04/ozhpv-challenge-2011.html .

Regards

Steve Nurse

President OzHPV
