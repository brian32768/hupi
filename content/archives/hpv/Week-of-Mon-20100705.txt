Thanks for the link, That's brilliant. We should have more of that
sort of advertising. Although the sound effects were a bit off.

I'm guessing that I'm not the only one to notice that Sam Whittingham and the 
eorge Georgiev Varna Diablo made an appearance in the USA cable channel Versus' 
overage of the 2010 Tour de France, albeit in a commercial for a sports drink, 
s "the world's fastest cyclist".
http://www.hydriveenergy.com/commercial.cfm
Kudos to Hydrive for this gutsy in-your-face celebration of the fastest bike in 
he world. 
If the TdF and the UCI is to be relevant to high speed bike commuting on the new 
ike superhighways they need to open up a time trial to unlimited bike designs.

The TdF and the UCI has no interest whatsoever in being relevant to high 
speed bike commuting.  That's not what they're for.

. TdF and the UCI are the
basketball or soccer of cycling competitions;
their standard training gear
is the cheapest possible .
. they are very democratic
if not very fast .

I'd point out that "cheapest" is not at all correct, it's the most expensive in the world dude!!! The entire peloton is on carbon, not steel ... where you been?

 

If you want cheap AND fast, change the geometry on the frame, move the downtube up like Boardman or Obree's bikes and it's 7% less drag than connected to the bottom-bracket.

 

Without that UCI rule, steel can compete by being not being penalized in the wind-tunnel by an arbitrary way to make a frame, has nothing to do with structure integrity, the design was outlawed explicitly because it was significantly less drag.

 

So, I totally disagree with the statement that the rules make it the cheapest when the absolute opposite is the truth.

but, you misunderstood what I meant:
. when I say "(their standard training gear
is the cheapest possible .)
I meant the architecture:
I can cheaply get a 10 speed that will
effectively allow me to train
for their competitions .
. the only diff' between their carbon bike
and my cheap bike is about 15lb and $$,$$$.$$
-- the work out is the same;
and I got that workout for very cheap,
a workout that will be good training for their
carbon bike races .
