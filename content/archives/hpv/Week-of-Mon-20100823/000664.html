Someone asked to be included in my reply about Zote source.  

I have dealt with 
Rubberlite in Huntington West Vergina  25728 
304 525 3116.
Like mst companies they have a minimum order of $300. 

That might sound like a lot but to build a shell you would need 
two pieces for the top (each piece is 30 x 40 inches so to cover say a 80 inch long shell you need 2 pieces). 

Then two for the bottom 
4 for the sides. 

All these  would be .5 inches thick of LD 45. You can order this stuff in any thickness. From paper thick to many inches. They slice it off a big cube.  Make sure you request no end pieces. These have a different finish. 

Its best to order extras of each color so if you do screw up you have spares. 

As an example I had to replace the top front section recently and I had the spare material on hand. 

You also need some HD 80 used for stiffeners. This you need say .1 thick. Only comes in black. 
 I also order a range of thickness just to have around. .125, .2 , and .5  Comes in handy.  

Average price is $25 to $30 per sheet. 

This might sound like a lot but it a hell of a lot less up front cost of composites +all the resins and throw away materials. 

Yes Zote is more expensive than CoroPlast but look at the difference in results. 
It takes a lot of my time to build something decent and I'm not about to use cheap materials. 
My time is worth a lot.
