<PRE>Regarding rim width vs. tire width, a rule of thumb from Sutherland's 
Handbook is that the metric width of the tire should be from 1.45 to 
2.25 the metric width of the rim.  So a 406-40 tire should be put on a 
rim at least 18mm width and no more than 27mm wide.

Since manufacturers have an interest in keeping bike's light and zippy 
they tend to spec rims more narrow than that guideline.  When suggesting 
tire choices to customers I'll fudge the range a bit, working from 1.5 
to 2.5 since the math is easier to do on the spot, but I'll warn 
customers about the blowout danger on tires at the high end of that 
range, though.

If the metric width of one's rim isn't marked, one can get a decent 
estimate by averaging the measurements of the inside width, between the 
hooks, and the outside width, between the sidewalls, then round toward 
the safe side.

As a Schwalbe dealer, I'll observe that they don't make a 20x1.5 
Marathon Plus, only a 1.35 (35mm) and a 1.75 (47mm).  A 47mm tire (the 
only one that a wide #7 Schwalbe tube will fit) should ideally, by 
Sutherland's reckoning, be on a rim of at least 21mm width.
