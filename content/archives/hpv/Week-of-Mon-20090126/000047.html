<PRE>Sure thing Nick,
We have been working up to bringing back that great big 
interdisciplinary human powered gathering many of us hold fond memories 
of, the recent reunification of the IHPVA should make it come together 
all that much sooner.
Several members of the board as well as other inspired event organizers 
are currently looking at several sites with an eye to the future.
This year the event at Ford's proving grounds in July, organized by 
IHPVA rules committee member Mike Mowett, will be bringing us all closer 
to that original IHPSC spirit.

Did you have some &quot;steam&quot; to give up for this happening?
I sure hope so, as an IHPSC takes the energy of many and at least a 
year's dedication to producing a world class event!
And hey, it's not like we quit racing HPVs, the WHPSC in Battle Mountain 
is in it's 10th year. www.whpsc.org

Keep an eye out for news and information at www.ihpva.org and be sure to 
check out the forum space there ( <A HREF="http://www.ihpva.org/forums/">http://www.ihpva.org/forums/</A> ) to 
discuss IHPVA events and other related things.

Thanks for your support!

&gt;<i> Good evening,
</I>&gt;<i> An industrial designer who puts out a bike design blog just asked me why the IHPSC hasn't been held in a while.  I told him it was because the volunteers who had been putting it on ran out of steam.  At least that's the way I understood it.  Has anyone considered building up steam to do it again?
