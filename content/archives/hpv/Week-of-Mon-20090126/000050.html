The series of Velomobile Design Seminars started in 1993 in Copenhagen. 
Through 15 years the seminars have been an important inspiration to the 
development of velomobiles for practical transport and sport.

The perspectives for velomobiles as an alternative, environmental 
friendly means of transportation are today more obvious than ever. In 
many situations a velomobile can replace a car, offering cargo space, 
weather protection, better aerodynamics and higher speed than an 
ordinary bicycle.
People need more physical exercise for health care reasons, to stay or 
to become fit, to improve quality of life. A velomobile is a comfortable 
and secure means to get training.

The velomobile doesn&#8217;t increase greenhouse-gas emissions, an issue, 
which has gained increasing attention in the last 5 years. The United 
Nations (Conference of Parties under UNFCCC) has called for the next 
Climate Conference in the first week of December 2009. It will take 
place in the Bella Center in Copenhagen. On this occasion, let us 
demonstrate the potential of velomobiles for an environmental friendly 
lifestyle.

The Velomobile Design Seminars allows to discuss many subjects, such as 
social acceptance of velomobiles, solutions for the infrastructure, 
technical innovations and design and styling.

The seminar organization invites you to present your contributions to 
skills and knowledge necessary for further development of velomobiles.

Send your abstract (max 500 words) to:
<A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv">designseminar at liggecykelforeningen.dk</A>
before October 31st, 2008.

The abstracts will be reviewed by the program committee:
Dr. Andreas Fuchs (Switzerland)
M.Sc. Frederik Van De Walle (Belgium/Sweden)
Dr. Stefan Gloger (Germany)
Dr. Carl Georg Rasmussen (Denmark)
You will be informed not later than December 31st, 2008, whether your 
proposal is accepted. If your abstract is accepted you will receive 
instruction for authors.
Deadline for submission of final paper will be August 31th , 2009.
The proceedings of the 6th Velomobile Design Seminar will be published 
in digital form only.
