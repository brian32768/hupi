One of our local Austin mad scientists is building himself a very nice 
solar electric quad...

One of the Pacific Cycles 2Riders that he has uses 18" wheels and he's 
looking for good rims for it to build suitable motor wheels.  The best 
we can locate (sort of locate) is the Zacplus by Weinmann, which is 
offered in an 18" model but seems unavailable in the USA.

If anyone knows of a source for this incredibly odd rim, please let me 
know.  List members in Europe might be especially helpful here.  If 
anyone knows a helpful person in China who could look in that market, 
that would be a plus.

Subject: [hpv] 20" Ballistic 600aII suspension forks,
	take them off my hands...
Message-ID: <4BE9DF31.8090506@att.net>

I have one (probably) complete and another, partial, Ballistic 
suspension fork, of the type supplied on Vision 'bents in the late 90's. 
  I'm cleaning up the garage and I'll entertain any reasonable offer for 
these.  Some spare parts are available as well.  These are for 406mm 
front wheels and the steerer tubes are threaded.  The forks use 
elastomers and springs.

The forks are clean and unused, mostly kept for spare parts.  They've 
just sat in the garage for about a decade.

I'd prefer that they be used to spread Sweetness and Light, but in the 
end I'm not all that picky who gets them.

Have  you tried the BMX or trials bike suppliers? 18" is an oddball size, but it seems to be used for some bicycle applications:

Highly recommend using either 16" or 20" wheels, 18" were made and even available in the USA in the past ... decremented wheel & tire size with limited availability so why build a new one?

 

fwiw,

Seems to be a company in Quebec that distributes them. Maybe they have  
rims:

http://www.belizebike.com/english/quad-cycle.html

Alex DV 15 and DA 16 are listed as 18" but Sheldon (RIP) lists three  
different 18" rims, and a 17 in among them. Wonder which one it is?

387 mm     18 x 1-3/8
381 mm      18 x 1-1/2
  369 mm     17 x 1 1/4
  355 mm     18 x 1.5- x 2.125

Click on specialty rims.

I think Birdy folders use 18" rims. Maybe these guys would know:

503 AC is OR.

Birdy do indeed use 355 rims; ICE have also used them in the past.

You may add 390 and 400 to the above list but even the Bandits of Bridgwater 
don't have rims in that size.  They /do/ apparently have a 371, but it's 
steel and only ten of the BRITONS' pounds, so although a Rigida it is 
unlikely to be premier cru.  Plus they don't list tyres in that size.

Iz confuzed.
