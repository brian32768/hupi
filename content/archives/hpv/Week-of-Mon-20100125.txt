Since you are talking about being visible

I would like to invite you to join me in riding for team in training.
I will be riding around Tahoe and again from Seattle to Portland (STP)

I know many of you are familiar with STP and recumbents are well
represented there.

Tahoe is a very different in that there are few recumbents.  Please
join me in riding Tahoe and show others that recumbents do fine on
hills, thank you very much.

If you are in the bay area please contact me to sign up.

the fund raising goals are 2500 for tahoe and 3500 for STP.

GO BENT

Certainly puts south Florida to shame. This place (S FL)has the  
climate, it has the space, it seems to have people who are interested  
in cycling, but it has little civic will.  What is has is a lot of  
intolerance.

The LA Times article says, "In Los Angeles, advocates are pushing for more bike lanes and other road improvements, a cyclists' bill of rights and more protection from police." 

Did the reporter intend to convey "more protection by police" or intend to be purposefully vague?

What is the best current source for short cranks (140-150 mm)? I would 
be wanting something along the lines of 48/38/24T rings.

The TA Carmina is available in 150-mm, but looking at Peter White's page 
<http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/carmina.asp>, it would be $550.00!!! 
for arms, spider, bolts and pinned rings.Yikes!!!

Tom,
When you go shorter you will be spinning faster.  So you can get by 
with smaller large rings than you are using on 165-175s.   And most 
recumbents start out geared too high for most riders.

Thanks for posting that.  Makes my prices look pretty good :-)

Agreed. Much better to have low enough gears to spin up hills, than high 
gears which are not useful unless you have your feet behind a fairing, 
and then only useful for short time periods on downhills.

I used Sheldon's Gain Ratio calculator <http://sheldonbrown.com/gears/> 
which accounts for crank length to come up with the 48/38/24T for a 
559-mm drive wheel. Most manufacturers would put on a 52/42/30 which is 
too high for most riders.

AFAIK Actionbent are still getting all their product from TW-Bents in
Taiwan.

P.S. Tom I finally retired the pic of your Blue Dragon Flyer as my screen
saver. I know have possibly the longest delta tandem trike on the planet.

Anyone have experience with this company? I understand they have been 
making the bikes for other companies such as Actionbent.
