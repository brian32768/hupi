</I>That is nothing short of scandalous - if it is true and if there are not 
some very special circumstances not mentioned in the article. In 
Switzerland walking and cycling to school are of course encouraged, as 
the benefits far outweigh the risks. However there is a rule for small 
children that they must walk, not cycle, unless the trip length is more 
than a specific amount. Many children also use folding mini-scooters. 
Even though one would think that these are highly dangerous, reported 
accidents are few.

In spite of this, cycling is decreasing and obesity is increasing. Also, 
many authorities engage in helmet wars, trying to make out helmetless 
people to be irresponsible. In my opinion this backfires, as many 
children will then not cycle and older ones have an extra incentive to 
switch to motor-rollers.
