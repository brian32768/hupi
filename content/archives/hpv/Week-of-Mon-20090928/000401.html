</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; The accident rate on the road near the school is less than the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; statewide average for similar streets, and no bike accidents have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; been reported in the last three years ending Feb. 1, according to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Mark Kennedy, regional traffic engineer at the state Department of

Yes, I saw that as well, but you can twist statistics a lot. Of course
there would be no bike accidents if there were no bikes ...
But if we assume that the road IS safer than comparable roads, then it
makes even less sense to discourage transport by bike. Anyway, there might
be local considerations that we can't even imagine - which is exactly why
it's such a shame that the article doesn't give a reason that students are
not allowed to bike/walk.

&gt;<i> &gt; Another part may be (and pardon my prejudice about US society) that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IF the school encouraged biking, and a child got in an accident
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while doing so, the parents might sue the school for whatever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly, but note that the school is not &quot;encouraging&quot; biking, or is
</I>&gt;<i> even neutral, but actively discouraging it. I would think the most
</I>&gt;<i> legally defensible position would be none at all, but IANAL.
</I>
Behind many of these policies is usually a couple of very specific
incidents that noone wants to see repeated, ever. Better disallow any risk
of it ever happening again. Neutrality might not be an option, if the local
community (the school's &quot;customers&quot;) demand(!) action.
Yes, my guess is a fatal (or near-fatal) accident involving a child on foot
or bike. But it's just a *guess*. Does anyone here *know*?


Sincerely,
