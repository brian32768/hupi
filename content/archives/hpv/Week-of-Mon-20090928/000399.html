I'm curious as to *why* biking or walking is disallowed? I read that
article and the one in Times Union about the boy who *does* ride to school
anyway, and there's no actual reason given for the ban.

The article does say, however, that the school is situated on a rather busy
road, which may be (part of) the reason. Another part may be (and pardon my
prejudice about US society) that IF the school encouraged biking, and a
child got in an accident while doing so, the parents might sue the school
for whatever reason?

Relating to my own children's school, the school actively encourages that
children be brought to school by bike or on foot - actually any other way
than by car. The school is on a busy road (by our town's standards, anyway)
and the traffic from parents taking their children to school is (rightly)
seen as in reality endangering the school road - which is sort of a
negative spiral: parents see the traffic, think that the road is (too)
unsafe for their children to bike on, and drive them to school, increasing
the traffic, etc.
All (I think) Danish schools have school guards on nearby pedestrian
crossings, to regulate the traffic. The school guards are children from
the school, 6th grade and up. They wear reflex vests and &quot;lollipops&quot;. We
have plenty of bike parking (although not as much as that Dutch video
showed!), and it's uncommon to have a long trip to school. The 4 miles that
the boy in the story has to ride to school would bring us to the next
town ;-)

Anyway, I agree that the schools (anywhere) should ENcourage their students
to ride (or walk) to school, and do whatever they can to make that possible
and as safe as they can. Parents should support this and accompany their
children on bikes. But traffic is never 100% safe - not even inside the
parents' cars, mind you!
The more that ride bikes (to school), the more common it gets, and the safer
it will be.


Sincerely,
