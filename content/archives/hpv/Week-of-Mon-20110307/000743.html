<PRE>Things I noticed and thought about:

1) He definitely covers more territory in a shorter period of time than most other kids his age.  In other words, he probably wears his parents out faster!  ;-)

2) I love the way he has discovered how to manage momentum ..... coasting, hard cornering, spinning.  Someday he could be an intimidating fighter pilot!

3) Ten years from now, I expect to hear about him in the Boston Marathon  ...... taking names and whuppin' ass!

4) Did anyone else notice that he'd discovered how to carry things by stuffing them behind the &quot;saddle horn&quot;?  He had also figured out that those items need to be really, really stuffed down firmly!

5)  Did anyone else notice that the dog always gave him a wide birth and kept Zach in his field of vision?  Evidently the dog had learned ( through hard experience) what a speed demon Zach is!  

This video just made my day on so many levels!  Mark, have you posted this to WISIL or BROL?  It's great!
