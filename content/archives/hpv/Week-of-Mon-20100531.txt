Racers come from Ohio, Wisconsin, Canada, etc to this event.  About 40 to 50 racers in all.
Recumbents, Time Trial bikes, Tandems, Tricycles, anything human powered is eligible to race.
We'll have a few super speedy streamlined recumbents that can circle the track at 32 mph for an hour.
Cash prizes awarded in different vehicle classes.  TT bikes are considered "Stock" racers.  The "Streamliners" compete in their own classes.

Last year, we hosted this Human Powered Speed Challenge at the Ford Proving Grounds in Romeo.  MANY THANKS TO THE VOLUNTEERS AND RACERS WHO COMPETED IN THIS EVENT.  10 world cycling records were set including the Fastest One Hours in history (56 mph - men's record and 52 mph - women's record), Fastest 100-mile Century 2 hours 33 minutes (39 mph avg) for a Man.  These were set in the streamlined recumbents that are similar to what will be at Waterford next weekend.  Some of these bikes have been seen on Discovery Channel and other science programs.  See www.recumbents.com for more info on these speedbikes.


Sincerely,
Mike Mowett
