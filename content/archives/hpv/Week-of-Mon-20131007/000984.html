<PRE>
Although the Solar Challenge this year has added a category: Cruiser Class that is more practical they still are stuck with the premise that PV cells need to be part of the car. This necessarily makes for a larger vehicle while most road vehicles  in everyday use still only carry one driver.  All our automotive infrastructure is based around a standard capacity of five so that it can fit safely into a road network inhabited by eighteen wheelers or in the case of the Australian race in question the monstrous Road Trains. The race rules sensibly require a chase vehicle and a lead vehicle so this race is not even close to being an example for future cars except for the drivetrain efficiencies demonstrated.

 Interestingly it is the Dutch teams that have won this years race. They seem to be the only country with an extensive and useable dual network of inter community roads. One for cars and trucks and the other for bicycles.  

As world population goes up in dense areas we will need more and better single occupancy vehicles that can operate safely, and the luxury of two different and exclusive road networks is not likely to happen. Indeed the cheap fossil fuels that have given us the roads we have now will not be cheap forever and could end our world through the Greenhouse should we use as profligately just what we know exists now. What then must we do?

There was another X-prize winner, but most have not heard of it because it was thought even more outlandish to ordinary folk than the Edison. I refer to The X-Tracer electric cabin motorcycle. Unlike the Edison, it had air conditioning, and would go much faster. Based on the Swiss Monotracer BMW powered vehicle that can cruise for hours at 160mph autobahn speeds, the updated version powered by AC propulsion's electric drive(Tesla uses the same technology) is three times as efficient as the best of modern Electric Cars on the road today and holds two people.

So what is wrong with it?  Though it has outrigger wheels that retract and deploy in less than 20 miliseconds, it does not self balance. Until such time as that problem is solved, it is no more practical as primary transportation than that popular but very heavy rolling Performance Art Piece known as the Harley Davidson.

Now with the self balancing and self driving technologies beginning to show real promise, consider this: Two such vehicles can share a single lane at speeds well above the 55 mph averaged by the winning Solar Challenger this year, automatically and safely navigating amongst the truck traffic which will be similarly self driven with inter vehicle communications for near instantaneous braking response times allowing safe close following distances and thus more throughput per lane and more individual destinations per standard car footprint. 

Solar covered parking garages are becoming more and more common here in California and most vehicles spend most of their time not being driven, often on sunny days. It just makes sense.
