<PRE>Paul,

That does appear to be true.  However, you are only looking at the auto
sector.  I was referring to work by economists trying to determine if it is
possible to have a &quot;steady state&quot; economy.  What they find is that
economies are like balloon animals.  If you squeeze them in one place, they
pop out somewhere else.  Presumably, that decrease in auto travel was
replaced by spending on smart phones, craft beer, or tattoos.  Even a
service economy uses energy, and globally, despite the staggering
recession, our energy use continues to increase.

Sorry to be such a downer.  My friends tell me I am no fun at parties.  But
I can say, I have never been unhappy about going for a bicycle ride.  :-)

And I still think your Honda is one of the coolest cars on the planet!

&quot;At least in the transportation sector, I believe our consumption of
resources is declining a bit.&quot;

&gt;<i> My reading of the research suggests that none of our technological
</I>advances have reduced our consumption of resources.  Every increase in
efficiency leads to greater consumption.

Warren
