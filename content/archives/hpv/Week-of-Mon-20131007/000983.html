<PRE>John,

I have been riding my e-assist LWB recumbent for two years now, and am
amazed at the reaction from most people.  All my adult life I have had
people angry at me for using &quot;their&quot; road.  Many would shout, &quot;Get a motor
on that thing!&quot;  When I finally did, most peoples attitudes changed 180
degrees.:-)

Most motorcyclists, and classic car and hot rod types love it.  Good ole
boys, in pickup trucks, give me the thumbs up, and little kids shout, &quot;Cool
bike mister!&quot;

But, except for the kids, they say they could/would never ride one.

Tom,

Yes.  Last year we went to the Lane Motor Museum, in Nashville.

<A HREF="http://www.lanemotormuseum.org/">http://www.lanemotormuseum.org/</A>

Probably the biggest collection of small and aero cars in the US...Tatras,
Messerschmidts, etc.

I have spent a lot of time on electric car sites since 2009.  I am
constantly amazed that most of the people there have no interest in
aerodynamics, or small vehicles.  They say stuff like, &quot;The VW XL1 is
retro-ugly.&quot;  The worst insult they can think of is &quot;golf cart.&quot;  All they
talk about is bigger, more powerful batteries.  They consider any
concession to efficiency, like rear fender skirts, a defeat for EV's.
</PRE>
