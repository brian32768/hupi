<PRE>John Riley asked:

Sounds like you have the C1 in mind.  ;-)  (self-blancing electric two wheeler)


Yes I was thinking of the Lit Motors machine. I have yet to see video of it performing above the mid thirty mph range however. I suspect that the processing power and speed isn't there yet. It is actually based upon a one hundred year or more old idea tried both on rail and land vehicles. Both were quite limited  in speed as the feedback loops were mechanical. Safety will be the governing principle for the time of  arrival of both self driving and self balancing. In the event that the popular will never allows it to come to fruition we can still ride our bikes to get more people more places with just the streets we have. CycLAvia is becoming popular in LA, where gridlock is an all daylight hours phenomenom these days.
