<PRE>The North American importer of the Monotracer is in Richmond, VA.

<A HREF="http://www.21stcenturymotoring.com/">http://www.21stcenturymotoring.com/</A>

I talked to him at the TTXGP races at VIR, back in 2010.  The Monotracer is
a truly amazing vehicle.  Built in Switzerland, it is breathtakingly
beautiful, and breathtakingly expensive.  The electric version is even more
incredibly priced.  That said, if I were a millionaire, I'd take one over a
Tesla in a heartbeat.

There were actually two different electric Monotracer designs built.  The
yellow, X-prize versions ran AC Propulsion drivetrains.

The red, Zero Race versions are equipped with Brusa drivetrains.

<A HREF="http://www.zerotracer.com/">http://www.zerotracer.com/</A>

As far as I know, the company had sold one electric version in the US, as
of this spring, but was having trouble getting it through customs, because
of no emissions documentation. :-(

The Lit Motors C1 is like most of the EV buzz...pure vapor.

As for EV's solving our climate change problem...that is like drinking diet
soda with your cake, to solve obesity.  This is the type of problem which
our species is not well equipped to deal with.  Studies show that we are
evolved to be overly optimistic.  When we didn't have a clue as to how the
universe worked, and where we were headed, just keepin' on truckin' was a
great strategy.  Even now, it is quite possible that we will be struck by a
huge asteroid, or a mega-volcano.  At that point we may be glad that we had
billions of people covering the planet.  Some might get through the
bottleneck.

But right now we have a problem that we really can predict with reasonable
mathematical precision, and our current path is a recipe for disaster.
