<PRE>Here we have real winter so wet isn't often the problem. I prefer a trike with an extensive fairing over being trapped in a sweat box. <A HREF="http://mnhpva.org/ice/2005/pages/30.html">http://mnhpva.org/ice/2005/pages/30.html</A>
This way I'm dressed for the weather when I get off the bike. For rain, a simple cape 
turns it into a head out Velo and I have a helmet with a full visor.

My other winter ride is a highly modified '85 Trek (<A HREF="http://bikesmithdesign.com/MyBikes/snowmobile/winter3.jpg">http://bikesmithdesign.com/MyBikes/snowmobile/winter3.jpg</A>) with Winter Marathons, 700-35 in the front and 26&quot; x 1.75 rear. It gets around great, even in thick, car churned &quot;Mashed Potato&quot; snow. 700-28 front/700-35 rear would be ideal but you work with what you have or can get.

I tried a 20x1.75 studded tire on an LWB but it just floated on the snow like it was hydroplaning. If I could get the WM or Kenda Klondike in a 451-28 I'd still be using an LWB 'bent in the winter. 
@ 67 y/o with osteoporosis it would be nice to be a little closer to the ground.

Barchetta huh? Been a long time since Ferrari's built anything that could be described as 'fun'.

Mark &quot;47 Minnesota winters on a bike&quot; Stonich 
(Won't be hitting 48 this year as I will be off the bike for at least 6 months due to an inattentive driver. 
At least I get out of the hospital tomorrow.)
