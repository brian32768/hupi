<PRE>&quot;I moved to my present home of 48 years to be within walking distance of my
workplace.&quot;

Man!  You must be a professional.  After building this bermed, passive
solar house 34 years ago,on the closest land to town we could afford, the
Trailways buses quit stopping here.  Riding 25 miles each way, would have
added three hours to my work day, and ended my marriage.  The idea of
working in the same place for more than five years was something only
professionals, and now perhaps only tenured professors can hope for.  My
longest run was 13 years as a technician at a school, which closed when the
industry we supported went to Asian.

Ironically, I could have done it on the electric assist bike I have now.
 But, unfortunately, I am retired.  :-)
