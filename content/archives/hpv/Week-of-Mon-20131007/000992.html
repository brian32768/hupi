<PRE>Quick mention that a major deal is to switch away from fossil for IC-engines on the planet, they will not disappear.
 
The best way to do that is algae, people in areas are growing it for biodiesel in blue-tarp lined pits, luv the internet, pressing it in cloth to get the oil and this is spreading where cash jobs are scarce, it's used for cooking and heating as well. 
 
For high-tech societies it's straightforward to use the sewage treatment plant to make the biodiesel with wastewater effluent feeding the algae and it's worth about 7L/2gal per day per person on a city system (this is more than a person produces in waste, add in a laundromat or twenty), and for comparison the USA burns 6L/1.6gal a day per person in all types of transportation fuels. 
 
The algae are good water cleaners and with ongoing improvements in harvesting it's today less costly to fully recycle the water using nano-filtration which removes smaller items than viruses for tertiary treatment, Lake Tahoe in the Sierra's has had total purification &amp; recycling since the 70's but it's been too expensive using chemicals and activated charcoal to be common.
 
To change things, start talking biodiesel from wastewater for your local sewage treatment plant if you want to make a dent in CO2 emissions, biodiesel can run in any engine, specialists are around to convert a car and while it's not perfect for a solution this is the only true &quot;transition&quot; fuel until something better comes up to run all the existing machines and still cut CO2 radically.
 
Making it removes CO2 and emits O2 so the carbon-footprint is tiny compared to fossil anything and it's not a food crop, to make it doesn't require arable land and we produce it daily.
