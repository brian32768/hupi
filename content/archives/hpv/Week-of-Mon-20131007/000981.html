Woops I must have hit a wrong key - my message below was sent before I could 
finish it.


&gt;<i>But an aerodynamically efficient body is considered unsaleable.
</I>......Well that's old history. I have hope that we are learning
that the environment needs help.


Continuation;

As an example;  7 or so years ago when I went up town to do my local 
shopping and running errands in my Foamshell VM people would stop by to talk 
to me about the vehicle.
At that time gas was $4 a gallon so they often said  my vehicle saved on gas 
money. $$$ not the environment. When the gas dropped to $3 the people 
disappeared.

A few years later and after some severe storms, such as Sandy in New Jersey
where I live, the public now say my vehicle is good for the ENVIRONMENT.
And there are many more people stopping to talk to me. And their enthusiasm 
comes out in their body language and their voices.

There are many more happy car horn toots, and &quot;I love your vehicle&quot; shouted 
from a passing car - and all the cell phone photos taken.

Meanwhile I can take a lane (for a while) and never get out of the way horn 
honks.

After riding bikes, streamliners, and VMs for 25 years this is a big change.

The public is interested, but not quite ready to get involved with a HPV.
What is needed is a nifty PRACTICAL local alternate transportation vehicle.

So that's what I am playing around with.
