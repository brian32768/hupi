<PRE>

Electric vehicles are not just coming, they are here. Pedelecs of all sorts are selling well in all parts of the world that haven't had the suburban sprawl business plan (Copyrighted first here in the Los Angeles area).  For we who are unfortunate enough to live with the byproduct of the &quot;one car sized transport fits all living style&quot;  endemic to this and so many other U.S. regions the automobile sized solution will not go away soon. I was proposing a way to wean our ordinary aging population off that particular modus operandi with technology able to utilize the infrastructure we  now have while doubling capacity.

Battery cost is descending rapidly and automation likewise so this will continue apace as did the gasoline auto of one hundred years ago that was similarly denigrated. I am old enough to remember &quot;get a horse&quot; as an epithet for stranded motorists.  At that time the urban infrastructure favored rail, an even heavier mode when mostly empty.

As a recumbent, faired bicyclist by choice I agree that we have the corner on ultimate transport efficiency as long as we are willing to dice with the cars. I am retired now, but  years ago I tried using my F-40 type streamliner for one of the longest commutes I allowed myself to do in my work life, 50 miles each way. To put this in perspective, I moved to my present home of 48 years to be within walking distance of my workplace. 

 Here in greater LA, fifty miles is not uncommon, and I was lucky to have both the stamina built up from my 2000 cross the U.S. trip and an almost fully &quot;bike trailed&quot; commute route. Not just any bike trail either. The San Gabriel River trail is almost without stops from the ocean 35 miles to Duarte, the town adjacent to my workplace.  My F-40 could be made to do the trip in three hours or less on almost flat ground. Only about 500ft of gain. It still came at a high price in my ability to perform my work, and transit on the same route would have taken as long. Sadly I returned to my 39mpg car.

 So perhaps you can see why I think that, while we need to contain our travel to more eco-friendly distances,  despite the limitations of electric transport, it can serve as an intermediate mode, if adopted by the people who would never bother to read this list.

Paul,

The concept is very appealing.  But I don't see it as a real vehicle.
Electric vehicles already have the challenge of high battery cost, and
limited energy.  The energy to keep the gyros spinning may not be much, but
they would require some, as would the computers.  The added weight,
expense, and complexity would seem to make it a non-starter.  But then, I
feel that way about cars, and it hasn't held them back.
