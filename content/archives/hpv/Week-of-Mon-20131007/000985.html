</I>&gt;<i> There was another X-prize winner, but most have not heard of it because it was thought even more outlandish to ordinary folk than the Edison. I refer to The X-Tracer electric cabin motorcycle. Unlike the Edison, it had air conditioning, and would go much faster. Based on the Swiss Monotracer BMW powered vehicle that can cruise for hours at 160mph autobahn speeds, the updated version powered by AC propulsion's electric drive(Tesla uses the same technology) is three times as efficient as the best of modern Electric Cars on the road today and holds two people.

</I>&gt;<i> So what is wrong with it?  Though it has outrigger wheels that retract and deploy in less than 20 miliseconds, it does not self balance. Until such time as that problem is solved, it is no more practical as primary transportation than that popular but very heavy rolling Performance Art Piece known as the Harley Davidson.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now with the self balancing and self driving technologies beginning to show real promise, consider this: Two such vehicles can share a single lane at speeds well above the 55 mph averaged by the winning Solar Challenger this year, automatically and safely navigating amongst the truck traffic which will be similarly self driven with inter vehicle communications for near instantaneous braking response times allowing safe close following distances and thus more throughput per lane and more individual destinations per standard car footprint.

Sounds like you have the C1 in mind.  ;-)  (self-blancing electric two wheeler)
