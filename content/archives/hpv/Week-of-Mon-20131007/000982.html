<PRE>It's funny to see how these things become the item of the day. I've had a Focus Designs Self-Balancing Unicycle for a couple of years. I purchased v1, followed by v2 when it was released. V2 was a major improvement in performance and stability over v1, but I doubt that v3 is all that much of an improvement. More powerful motor though.

As a velomobile operator for mostly fun and errands, I prefer the HPV aspect of my transport. When I need to take a 2 mile trip to the market for a few items to stuff in a backpack, the SBU fits the bill. It is practical commuter gear, as I also have a bus pass and take it onboard with me if my travels might exceed 12 miles round trip. Anything longer and the velo takes top billing.


It's all about fun for me, though there's a lot of practicality in both the velomobile and the SBU.

OK, they're not human-powered, but, given the recent discussions of HP unicycles and more-or-less-fully electric bikes, I was amused to hear a piece on NPR regarding the not-so-obvious next step:
