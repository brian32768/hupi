Subject: [hpv] Yoikes! (or be more careful, trikeman!)
Message-ID: <CABk_z1K1RPqErvKDP1BgT0nEL4WS9KojcjL62E+p8Fhkt9JRiw@mail.gmail.com>

I knew I needed to replace a spoke in the right wheel of my Trice ...
I could hear it clicking. Being a good, conscientious, rider, I
checked the left wheel as well. Yoikes! Where are the spoke heads that
are supposed to be looking at me on the trailing spokes, inside? Gone,
gone, gone.

A reminder: don't be like me. Safety check your wheels more often
instead of less often. If I had been what I was, I would have kept my
wheels tight and those spokes probably would not have parted ways with
their head buttons in the first place.

Edde: Who da fool?
