"Only" $15,500 - wow.   How could you possibly get that "value" back in a year.  I only spend $2,500 on fuel for my real car.  

There
 is no way most people could power this by using a rowing motion.  I 
think the power comes from the batteries.  One notable problem is that 
he doesn't give the weight of the vehicle and the motor power.  It would
 be clear from that what real climbing ability it has.  Given that most 
people cannot get up any sort of grade on a regular bike, powering a 
whole vehicle like this would be impossible.  

As far as I know 
there is no such thing as a "street legal low mass vehicle".  Some low 
speed electrics are allowed in SOME places with a very limited top 
speed.

The Human Car people are based in Southern Oregon & they had the "basic" machine at the HPC 7 or 8 years back. I see that they've added electric "assist" and rudimentary bodywork, but not much has changed beyond that. I can't see how it compares to a more "conventional" HPV or E-assist HPV... both of which we've raced to see what works well. I don't think it's much more than someone's vision- and not necessarily a clear vision at that.

So nothing that any old velomobile can do except have a metric fuckton more 
air and rolling resistance and double the pricetag?

Yeah, they keep working on it but the basic concept never improves.
And their promo videos always show the thing rolling downhill.

FWIW, I'm developing an F# program to help me learn it, this to provide a data structure & methods to simulate real-world riding better, nothing NASA would be interested in but there is no standard data now for generic frame & rider performance off the track, so, the project has the goal to develop a cloud website for me to also learn to deoploy to the cloud on Azure, but I can't afford it right now anyway so Plan A is to put static charts online free from the data & update those for people to use in the end.
 
Part of what's been missing is the ability to detail sections of the bike separately, they're all kinda' dumped into the Cd vs frontal-area so the whole thing is really abstracted. So, there are  param's for rider position, handlebars, frame geometry, wheels and cadence, each with its own Cd contribution to total drag, and those vary with wind-speed & direction, interdependencies.
 
An important param is a gust coefficient, most natural wind conditions have shifts of wind-speed & direction during an hour. In weather there's a gust factor, (avg gust speed for 3s or duration)/avg speed, you need this for track riding as well, and since most world records were measured on them, all that data can be used to begin with to calibrate things to start (Merckx's piste had a listed Cd of 0.75, 485-watts to go under 50-km's, Boardman's mono-piste built by Merckx was 0.165 & took 445-watts to go over 6-km's farther in an hour). I'm using the charts from http://www.bikecult.com/bikecultbook/sports_recordsHour.html for numbers ...
 
Curious if this may be of use to anyone on the list?
 
cheers,
