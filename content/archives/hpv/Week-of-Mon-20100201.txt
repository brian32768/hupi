I've used Bullet proof cranksets. Fairly inexpensive and they can be paired up with Rocket Rings

One of the importers in Australia goes down to 150mm at
standard prices then to about 120mm in ISIS at about $AUS100
wholesale. I mean to look it up at work today but forgot.
Prices in Oz are awful by US standards.

Locally Trisled have them online so if they're $AUS50 they should be cheaper over there

On the cheap side, Origin-8, a house brand of a national bike 
wholesaler, has 145, 155, and 165mm 130/74mm BCD cranks that retail for 
about $55 (square taper), though these are probably not stiff enough to 
take an athletic pounding.

There are lots of short BMX cranks with 110mm BCD, and one can easily 
find long chainring bolts that will hold three rings, and you can get 
110mm rings from 34 to 60 teeth.

:) The ones Trisled sells have been used to set a number of
world and Australian speed records. I have used some to
break some other things (3 Nexus 8 hubs, for instance). I'm
not convinced that cheap cranks are the weak point, you
know?

Go to Bentrider Online and search their forum for "Performer" and you will find a lot of posts. They make a nice looking carbon fiber lowracer. In fact there is one for sale on the BROL classifieds.

Anyone have experience with this company? I understand they have been making the bikes for other companies such as Actionbent.
