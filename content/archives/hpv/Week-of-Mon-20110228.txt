Thanks. That is a later report, but has much better data than the
report I remembered.

That's somewhat old hat. Some tandems and single-speeds use a chainring or sprocket placed between the two straight chain runs to vary tension. This is called a "ghost chainring", per Sheldon Brown: http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tandem-build.html . You can see a video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKmUoLPzDIc

The only advantage the Roll-Ring has is that it's flexible and works with different chainring/sprocket configurations. With a rigid chainring, you need to have several different sizes available to fine-tune tension.

People do this all the time to tension the chain on tandems. They just  
stick in an appropriately sized chainring.

Not so.  You fine tune the tension by moving the ghost ring closer to 
one or the other timing ring.  When the timing rings are the same 
size the chain is slackest when the ghost ring is midway between them.

I was thinking that the Roll-Ring might produce useful damping on a long 
chain run and allow for elimination of idlers in some cases.

I'd like to see that.

The rest of us just pull the chains apart and slip the spacer ring forward
a couple of teeth on one chain.

If we had telekinetic powers, we could dispense with derailers [1] 
altogether.  A little telekinesis on the uphills would not hurt either. ; )

I'd like to see someone move a ghost ring either fore or aft.
