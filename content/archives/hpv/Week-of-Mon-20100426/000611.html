Just back from another unsupported tour, I like them for the freedom to roam, no schedule but I do find it hard to find powdered food in deli-marts so carry that stuff from home and have sent it ahead to get more on the longer tours.

 

Longest &amp; first big tour 2,200-miles, ran out of money and had to work to get home but was hooked on it. Did many 1,200 mile tours, just back from doing three days of riding to meet a friend in Nevada and set a PR of 156-miles, from Phoenix to I-40 &amp; US93 in one haul, tailwinds the first 70. On the way back the wind wasn't so nice, same wind, different direction for me ...

 

And, as a part of the fun, it started to rain so I got up and did another 23-miles to beat the storm to Kingman, AZ, hit by squalls a few times but the way I set up for this one I was light on weather gear so it was better for me to soak down in riding clothes than get everything damp trying to sit it out. Arrived fairly dry, on long tours I could wait it out without damping down everything by carrying two tarps (no tent, bivy &amp; tarps are more convenient) ... then when farther up between Beatty &amp; Tonopah, NV, the storm left me fresh snow on huge desert valleys to peaks and was nice enough to leave the road alone, awesomely beautiful touring, 40F, the squalls stayed on the peaks.

 

The hardest part is putting the wet clothes back on in the morning, you have to preserve your &quot;drys&quot;, don't count on a laundromat, lately it's obvious most if not all of the single-store deli-mart/gas stations are out-of-business now, Goldfield, NV, has one store and one cafe left, all the public phones are removed from most of NV and those towns only support a single cell carrier, had a hard time calling people ...

 

Can't recommend this kind of touring to anyone but I have it down, only put stuff on the rear rack, no front anything because I do dirt and you crash bad in deep gravel with weight up front (first tour mistake), and that's not uncommon to run into. You need to carry a gallon of water on the bike if your stages are like out here &amp; 70-miles between stores, on longer stages I buy #10 cans of juice &amp; other liquids as well, you'll overnight a lot before new water, I do carry a purifier and use it to top off on some routes. No kitchen, no stove but do carry a trail cup and make coffee over stick fires in a couple of minutes.

 

My averages for mileage are way out of hand, over 100-miles/day on pavement and 50-60miles/day on dirt but these were vacations and I was getting somewhere &amp; back, learned on this one that 172.5mm cranks are what fit me best, had to replace a set just before leaving and found that out-of-the-saddle they matche my hips way better with that little change, much easier than 175mm, less rocking is the main thing but getting the foot over the top is a lot easier now.

 

So, not only do you feel, see, smell as you ride, there's always something to learn about riding!

 

Plan your trip as best you can, have the maps you need, I use DeLorne for most things as they ground verify the roads, I copy the pages needed. Google isn't too helpful with this, and, I discovered this trip you have to use GPS in the boonies now, signage is expensive to maintain so it's gone out there at least in NV, had to bag trying for a direct route on dirt because of that on a tour I did just a month ago to the same area, Google wasn't good enough, you must have the GPS, didn't find any local maps in what stores are still open. Didn't have my GPS with me ...


Go for it, do smaller ones first to get your gear down, it never is right without doing this a few times, it's easy to get too heavy, leave-it-behind is the motto for the most fun touring, layered clothes, basic shelter gear, small repair kit &amp; tools.

</I>&gt;<i> Wally,
</I>&gt;<i> You've done short, supported tours before like DALMAC. Have you ever tried an unsupported tour? If you have, then just multiply some of the irritations together to anticipate the possible aggravation factor, and then check the balance versus of the adventure/do-it-yourself factors as you can envision them. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Myself, although I loved riding DALMAC and hanging around with so many great people, I would usually choose to go it alone. I want to challenge myself and have that &quot;alone time&quot; that I find far too rare. That said, my past self-supported rides have been far too short (a week or less) - so there may be bigger aggravation factors I haven't encountered yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I plan on a 13-month &quot;around the country in a non-linear fashion&quot; tour to begin around Oct 1 that will be mostly self-supported, but will end with riding ROAM in Aug of 2011.
