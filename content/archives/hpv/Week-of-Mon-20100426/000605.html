It depends how much you like people. A standard group
supported tour involves daily contact with the same 10-200
people EVERY SINGLE DAY. Route changes, detours, days off
and so on are generally not negotiable, or will require
quite a lot of discussion. A more expensive small-group
supported tour might just be you riding while your
valet-chauffeur drives the giant house-truck along behind
you and avoids all those problems. Even now and then I've
seen a couple where one drives while other rides, but that's
rare. Although I don't think I've ever seen the paid valet
option in action at all...

Unsupported touring means getting to choose how much contact
you have, based on what you feel like. Mostly, anyway -
deciding you want a sociable gathering in the middle of
Death Valley is a bit forlorn. But it also means being very
self-sufficient in many places (Death Valley, for instance
:<i>)
