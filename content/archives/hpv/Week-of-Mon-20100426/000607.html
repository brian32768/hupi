&gt;<i> I don't think I've ever seen this discussed here before.  I already posted this topic once on BentRider -- but 
</I>&gt;<i> only got a few responses.  What are the advantages or disadvantages of attempting a cross country tour 
</I>&gt;<i> either supported or unsupported IF the cost was not a concern?  
</I>
I think there are a couple of questions to think about which should make the answer fairly obvious:

1) Do you want to carry your own gear?

2) Do you want to know who you riding partners ahead of time are, or are you ready to spend ~3 months riding with the same group of strangers, or would you prefer to ride solo?  

3) How do you feel about having a sag van following you across the country?

4) Are you more comfortable with a fixed/rigid agenda, or do you like to be flexible and ready to change plans to follow your whim?

I'll also add that my favorite camping spots are the ones that a group tour wouldn't find or use.  Decommissioned National Forest campgrounds, small streamside clearings, unreserveable small campgrounds and similar spots are much more enjoyable to me than loud county campgrounds which are designed for RVs.  Those camping sites aren't really available for group trips, but can be pretty easy to find when touring solo (especially on National Forest lands...so many nights on the western half of the US).

I can also understand not wanting to tour solo.  I enjoy overnight trips by myself, but don't think that I'd like anything longer.  My favorite trips are with 1 or 2 other cyclists who have a similar riding style and preferences to my own.  My tours are only a week long though, and it is easier to find someone else who can take a week off with me than someone who can take 2-3 months off.
