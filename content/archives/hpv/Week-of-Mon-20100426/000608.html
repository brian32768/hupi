<PRE>If one is doing their first such trip, and IF money is no object, I would 
think a supported TransAm tour would be the way to go.  I had a lot of fun 
doing about 450 miles unsupported across the midwest, but multiply that 
distance by a factor of five, and the advantages in planning and security 
surely outweigh the flexibility you get by striking out on your own.  You 
still have choices among different outfits, group sizes, pace, level of 
support, etc.  Just choose carefully the tour that you think comes closest 
to matching your preferences, and enjoy!

&gt;<i>I don't think I've ever seen this discussed here before.  I already posted 
</I>&gt;<i>this topic once on BentRider -- but only got a few responses.  What are the 
</I>&gt;<i>advantages or disadvantages of attempting a cross country tour either 
</I>&gt;<i>supported or unsupported IF the cost was not a concern?  Obviously riding 
</I>&gt;<i>supported in a group tour has an advantage of knowing where you will end up 
</I>&gt;<i>each day and have dinner and breakfast.  And riding unsupported alone or 
</I>&gt;<i>with a couple guys allows you to plan your own agenda for food and stops. 
</I>&gt;<i>What do you guys that have done either before think is the most enjoyable?
</I>&gt;<i> Thanx,
</I>&gt;<i> WKiehler
