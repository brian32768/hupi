Is anyone aware objective tests of these bearings?

There are plenty of subjective statements that a user "felt faster" or 
recorded a higher speed, but nothing that does actual side by side tests 
under controlled circumstances.

The only tests I'm aware of found reductions in resistance of under
10% compared to steel bearings, but then you have to remember that
this was reductions in what was already a very small resistance, not a
10% from some large value.

Another interesting point was the biggest reduction was in dry ceramic
bearings compared to greased steel bearings. Some ceramic bearings are
designed to be run dry and deliver the same life as grease packed
steel bearings, but are slightly more difficult to get set up
correctly and transmit more noise than grease packed steel.

Well, it *does* seem that a permanent magnetic field wouldn't affect an 
AC inductive sensor.
