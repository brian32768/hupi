There is not much traffic on the HPV lists anymore. Technology changes,
techniques evolve. I have often felt that much of the benefit of the lists
was as a community, but communities are not static. This community seems to
be in decline.

How do list members feel about letting go of the HPV lists?

I would love to see more activity! But, without support from the users, 
I guess it's inevitable that it will go away.

I agree with you. For many years now, by far the most active place to discuss recumbents in English has been here:

Curiously enough, the admin of another mailing list to which I subscribe 
proposed its retirement only a couple of days ago.  Which immediately 
brought a flurry of posters out of the woodwork...

Apropos these lists, however, I think they've probably had their day. 
Just as long as no-one imposes fearful consequences on anyone having the 
temerity not to want to play in Mr Zuckerberg's Walled Garden ;-)

Many thanks to all the admins past and present for keeping the thing 
running.

Are there other places for the velomobile community to share information?  I am a member of the Yahoo group but unfortunately it is not moderated so we are just getting spam there.

Agreed. It will be sad to see the list go. I've been a member since the mid
90's.

I've lurked here I guess since the Group began but never posted anything. Been Bent since 1992 (19 Bents so far and getting new one in May if the wife will let me). I set up 2 Yahoo Groups?in 2001 and 2005 centered on electrifying DFs and Bents that are still alive at 3,500 members but like the HPV List very few posts per month since about 2009. Prior to 2009 I'd get hundreds of posts a week. Many of the Groups I belong to have zero posts now so it isn't just the HPV List gathering dust. One possible reason for the lack of involvement is there are just sooooo many Groups/Forums out there now that are?focused on specific topics which attract only people with one specific bike/trike/scooter where as the HPV List and well my 2 Groups are all over the map (includes everyone with spoked wheels) and me thinks Groups that are not focused are going the way of the Dinosaur. People have information overload and want to just use Focused Groups specific to what they ride i.e. if I rode a BikeE I'd only look at Groups focused on BikeEs. ?
As for whether to kill off the HPV List question---yeah maybe its time to end it or merge the membership with other Groups that are more alive (if any exist)???

I'm not nuts about the idea, but if there's no significant traffic
(except the lament about no significant traffic), then I guess it's
time.  I got a lot of good hints about streamliner building from this
list.

I'm also the list manager and webmaster for RBENT (Recumbent Bike
Enthusiasts of North Texas, http://www.rbent.net).  Several years ago
one of our guys set up an RBENT forum <http://rbentonline.org/YaBB.pl>
and there's a good deal of activity there, but the list gets maybe two
or three posts a month.  I have nothing at all against Bud_Bent.  I'm
a firm believer in the free market, and apparently more folks prefer
the forum.  So be it. <Sigh>

Is there an email interface to BentRider forums? E.g., can one get emailed updates for a given subforum? Why I ask:

IMHO forums (i.e., websites run with software like vBulletin and phpBB) and maillists (like this) serve different usecases. Relative to me, forums (of which I use several, mostly related to software--e.g., Linux distros) seem "pull": I go there when I have a specific interest or problem. I can subscribe to individual threads, and get updates about them, but can't subscribe (am I missing something?) to an entire forum (e.g., BentRider>Main Category) or subforum/category (e.g., http://www.bentrideronline.com/messageboard/forumdisplay.php?f=21 ).

OTOH, relative to me, maillists are "push": stuff appears in my inbox, I take a look and either read or delete. Perhaps it's just me, but I find that a useful usecase for some domains, e.g., recumbency.

Yes, you can set "Instant email notification" on a post to any thread you
are starting or replying to.

That's ... umm ... pretty much exactly what I said :-) My question remains,

I don't think I've posted on this list in quite a while.   Most of my
nattering goes on with the Bentrider message board.  Love it or not, on
Facebook there is a WHOLE lot of activity amongst Recumbent Riders,
Recumbent Trikes, Recumbent Classifieds.  I think there are a few other
recumbent bike based pages as well.   More than I can handle, often.

The right bike is the one you will ride!

Goodbye list. :-)

JW and I already talked about it, it was my suggestion.
I have just been dragging my feet for a year or so.

I have to pay a monthly fee to keep a virtual server running to handle
these lists, it takes extra time to run it, and I want to shut it down to
save time and money. The hupi.org web site will migrate to another less
expensive service that we (JW and I) already have online.

Let's see...

Started at Sonoma State around 1990 on some kind of Sun station in Computer
Science department = hpv at sonoma.edu

NeXT cube (pulled from storage) gopher server and email

Sun 68040-based workstation (donated) also first Web server for
www.ihpva.org

1996 - Quit Sonoma State job so moved IHPVA.org to 486 Linux box at
CDS1.net Mailing lists move to bikelist.org

2008 or so?? Bikelist.org shuts down so the lists move to hupi.org at
hostmonster.com to avoid the ongoing ihpva.org/whpva.org political battle.

Hostmonster immediately overloads (too much traffic on lists) so move to
virtual host at Tektonic.net ($30/month)

2015 - without mailing lists to support I can move hupi.org back to
hostmonster ($4/month).

Well I still have my 'bent...a Canondale recumbent... It's a lovely bicycle but since I got an electric bicycle (well hubby and I are 70 now), I end up riding that one more than my bent...I do ride my bent at least once a week however... My hubby had to give up his bent completely after his third stroke...he only rides electric now...we still both work out daily however... I do read this listserve and would be sorry to see its demise...

I set up 2 Yahoo Groups in 2001 and 2005 centered on electrifying DFs and Bents that are still alive at 3,500 members but like the HPV List very few posts per month since about 2009. Prior to 2009 I'd get hundreds of posts a week. Many of the Groups I belong to have zero posts now so it isn't just the HPV List gathering dust. One possible reason for the lack of involvement is there are just sooooo many Groups/Forums out there now that are focused on specific topics which attract only people with one specific bike/trike/scooter where as the HPV List and well my 2 Groups are all over the map (includes everyone with spoked wheels) and me thinks Groups that are not focused are going the way of the Dinosaur. People have information overload and want to just use Focused Groups specific to what they ride i.e. if I rode a BikeE I'd only look at Groups focused on BikeEs.

It's inevitable (I suppose) for online usage to shift from one protocol
to another, as time goes by. First it was BBS, then Usenet, then
listgroups, now it's forums.

Oddly enough, we've been having a similar discussion regarding the utility of the forum on the OHPV site: http://www.ohpv.org/forums/ with regard to "other" forums and Facebook/Pinterest/Twitter.  

My 2 cents: Facebook/Pinterest/Twitter are the flavor of the moment, but are owned by entities who probably don't care if we exist or not. If they disappear, (anyone remember MySpace?) our community for another place to gather. There are plenty of forums out there with similar constituencies (Bentrider, Recumbents.com, BikeForums), so perhaps a mass migration is in order. 

I like several features of the RikeForums forum software, but then Recumbents.com is run by one of "us". On the gripping hand, Bentrider seems to have the most active community. 

My suggestion is that we ask Bryan Ball to set up a couple subforums for the IHPVA: one for general business and a second "private" forum for the IHPVA board to mutter amongst themselves. What say ye?

Brian,
thank you for your time and effort that you put into this list. It has been
the primairy source and method to talk about anything related to hpv.
Perhaps it served it's purpose and other types of media come into the flow
such as twitter, facebook etcetera.
It was nice to be a part of it.

I think there are several effects. Many people of my age (over 60) are 
used to mailing lists but have "heard it all" and are tired or too busy. 
Many of us boycott Zuckerberg's Walled Garden and similar things for 
various reasons. (I do have an account on Diaspora (which is what 
Facebook *should* be), however I can't find any HPV-activity except a 
group https://diasp.eu/tags/velo with a single French-speaking member!)

Young people however are used to Facebook and most simply no longer 
respond to any proper emails unless they really have to, even when 
subscribed to lists. The new electronic media have increased rather than 
decreased the digital divide. (In Switzerland they are also killing 
cycling: young people prefer to use public transport where they can 
constantly follow their online lives).

I think what works best these days is combination of web articles and a 
lightly moderated forum, especially if this *also* sends emails to 
registered users. However these requires quite some resources and 
interest, otherwise they also die.


Thanks Brian for sticking at it so long! As maintainer and host it is 
your decision whether to stop now. Can you keep the archives up or 
transfer statically to /www?

Goodbye, list! Please remember that you can send articles to me for 
Human Power eJournal http://hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm
or use the WHPVA Pedalwiki:
http://wiki.whpva.org/vph/index.php?title=Pedalwiki

The former site will continue: Brian will find a cheap webhost and I'll 
continue to sponsor the domain, or Dave Wilson or John St.

The latter site is rather dead and split up into three languages, but do 
get an account and write interesting pages, if you like. It is hosted 
and sponsored by Catatec in Bern, Switz.

whpva.org had a forum once, but this got lost. It is now a static 
website and we have a mailing list for purely administrative purposes. 
ihpva.org still has its forum, but there are few recent postings.

Cheers everybody!

bad, but they seem to have died on their own so this is more
recognition and euthanasia than murder...

I'm grateful to Brian and everyone else who've made the lists work
over the years, they've been a very helpful resource.

Archives would be nice, that way things are findable.

"(In Switzerland they are also killing cycling: young people prefer to use

Theo has it right.  Cycling, in the 20th century, was never as popular in
the US as in Europe.  But it is definitely less popular with my kids
generation than with mine.

The only good news is that cars are also less popular with many of them.

It was a great ride while it lasted.  Hope to bump into you all somewhere
on the web.

I have grown up with hupi since I got into recumbent's in 1995.  Owned many
and loved the info on the list.  I am now into Electric trikes as I have
reached 75.  I too would like to thank Brian for all he has contributed. I
will have to agree that now is probably the time to shut down.  Hate to see
it got but there is not much activity.

I just tried diaspora per Theo's suggestion.

I still prefer the close knit feeling that can develop on mailing lists.

Facebook-style interfaces feel more like crowded rooms full of strangers,
with a few people shouting "look at me! look at me!".

Not my idea of "community".

Amen.

Please, if you shut down the list, keep the archives online.

The other option is to port the lists back to Hostmonster.
Now that traffic has dropped off and subscriptions
are down I can investigate this.

Subject: [hpv] List utility

There is not much traffic on the HPV lists anymore. Technology changes, techniques evolve. I have often felt that much of the benefit of the lists was as a community, but communities are not static. This community seems to be in decline.

How do list members feel about letting go of the HPV lists?

I have been a long time reader of this and the some of the related lists 
and value what is said here as each member has an established reputation 
(like visiting long-time friends).

I understand the desire to move this to a new format (although I don't 
dislike this one), but moving it to something associated with BROL if 
possible (as he has a huge, dedicated userbase of mostly like-minded 
people) is FAR preferable than something associated with Facebook, 
Twitter, or similar (based on personal reasons).

A forum format can allow a huge volume of ideas to be present (like 
BROL), but if you don't keep up with the forum they can disappear 
quickly from "easy" discovery. The mailing list format makes sure we can 
see everything, but is really only manageable for limited user input 
because high volume can end up leading to immediate trash-canning of 
email due to lack of time and too many emails (even with a digest ability).

If there was some way to send forum posts to an automatically sorting 
wiki so that long-term retrieval was easy and viable, that would be even 
better - and perhaps lead to fewer reposts by people who didn't know 
that the topic had just been discussed last month (not a problem here). 
There has been much intelligent information shared here over the years 
that, while perhaps saved, is somewhat "lost" due to the difficulty in 
retrieval of the information.
