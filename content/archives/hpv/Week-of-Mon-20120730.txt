Not sure, but it looks like a circular chainwheel, right?

Watching the Tour de France as usual, I noticed for the first time: 
elliptical chainrings in the last time trial, especially on the bikes of 
Wiggins and Froome in yesterday's time trial.  Due to my out-of-it status, 
I'm sure, but a na?ve question:  Does Sam Whittingham and the other Battle 
Mtn battlers ride with ellipticals?
