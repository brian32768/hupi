There is nothing compelling a person to wear specific clothing for 
bicycling. A cyclist can dress in sport clothing or choose any other way 
to dress.

The Copenhagen Cycle Chic website provides a good introduction to how 
bikes and looking good have begun to come together, cycling as the 
normal and preferred way of getting around.

"rant from Grant" about bike clothing from the Rivendale perspective;

I have been there. Copenhagen is cool in the summer and is also flat. 
Dressing like that on a typical Upper Midwestern day would leave me a 
soaked and itchy mess at the first hill.

Well, Grant does end up recommending special clothings - specifically, 
breathable, wicking fabrics.

I do take issue with his shoe recommendations - foot retention IS 
necessary on a high bottom bracket 'bent.

I also think the average trip length is very short, like maybe a  
couple miles. That is interesting from a transportational point, but  
not so much from a sport / recreational point, where the distances  
are likely to be longer.

The city is compact (for its population) by USian standards - although 
urban sprawl has happened there also.

Ex Officio makes a nice line of outdoor activity clothes that don't make 
you look like a superhero.  These have all the technical aspects of the 
sports clothes like wicking, UV protection, and lots of sealable pockets.

At the shop, we carry these models:

Men's pants: Amphi shorts
Women's pants: Take Over shorts
Men's shirts: Reef Runner
Women's shirts:  DryFly

More models can likely be found on Ex Officio's website.

Your opinion that peer-pressure and conformity mean "nothing" is interesting, and possibly virtuous, but completely unrealistic, as a multi-million-dollar cycle-clothing industry demonstrates.

Where I ride a bike, cow manure and mud represent common shoe
accessories. Mostly there is no one around 'ere who cares a spit what I
look like when riding or working outdoors, certainly not  the antelope
that's been hanging around around the fields.  Mom Nature alone pretty
much dictates my day's wardrobe selection.

Wear what you want, when you want, for whatever reason you want. You
have a choice.  Consider though when picking out duds whether the
bicycle is your destination or if it is the means to get to a
destination, something that might be totally unrelated to bicycling.
Being yourself on a bike is the core of the Cycling Chic movement, which
started in Copenhagen and is becoming a global phenomena. Quoting
Colville-Andersen it's about "Regular people in regular clothes on a
variety of bicycles. But as we all know by now, it's not about the
bicycle, it's about YOU on the bicycle."

Put it another way. If a person wears their everyday normal clothing
while bicycling, then bicycling more easily becomes an everyday normal
part of life.

Tom,
I don't think so, his was fixed geometry and this one's variable.  The 
disadvantage of this one is I can't see a way to put a fairing on it.

Please pass this message on to Joe Kochanowski, Tony Licuanan, Jerry Onufer, 
Steve ? if you can.  I'm pretty sure they're not on the list.
Thanks.

But on the rare occasion when I need to hoist the metal 50 miles down a 
highway, spending all day pedaling like the devil, I can appreciate the 
value of some tights that won't yank half the hair off my legs.

Hi John,

I would not personally  wear a kilt when riding any recumbent, faired or

The people that complain about wearing "funny" clothes while riding
bicycles are the same kind of people that don't do physical labor
because it will make them sweat. Being outdoors in TX for longer than
it takes to walk from office to car precludes wearing most forms of
regulation office wear, and the sooner some people wise up to that the
better off the rest of us will be. If you have to be work-ready as
soon as you come through the door, and there's no place to change,
then you need to find another job. Employers who attempt to dictate
transportation choices are no better than ones that dictate other
choices outside of the work environment.

Well, I have an office with a door, and the bathroom has a shower, so I 
could were whatever and change. However, since it is only 9-km to work, 
a leisurely ride in wearing wicking fabric normal clothes is a nice 
option to have. In addition, just being able to jump on the bike for a 
short hop in comfort without changing is also good.

One thing I learned, though it's tough to preach it, is that it is the
clothes that stink. Most "modern" hi-tech fabrics (no, I haven't tried
them all ... this comes from a fabric science major) need to be washed
in super hot water to not get stinkier as they age. Perhaps one of
these new steam washers would answer for that. For me, I wear wool on
top all year-round, and my supply of Boosucker shorts ships today from
Rivbike.

Elrey cops to the fact that in one of the early VeloVisons he is
quoted as loving Coolmax fabric for riding clothes.

That was then. Wool is now. You used to need Woolite to wash your
woolies. Not anymore. Special tip: it washes great in those porcelain
washing machines in hotel rooms, next to the shower. You just push the
flush button and get a fresh rinse. Gotta love that. Too bad you have
to kneel down to use 'em tho.

8-foot trailer? Is the cat a tiger? ;)

My cat came back from the vet in a "Pet Taxi" carrier bungee-corded to a 
rear rack.

My thoughts exactly- but then I remember that one of my cats is 20 pounds. He's hefty.

FWIW: a "standard" Xtracycle attachment doesn't work on a trike or many other recumbents with a 20" rear wheel. Terracycle is building an Xtracycle frame that takes care of that- they were showing it off at the races here in Portland. It's an impressive unit.

Nick-

I did see Joe this weekend at PIR- he seems to be doing OK, whatever "OK" means for Joe. I didn't see Tony or Steve, but then I spent my time taking the velomobiles around Portland instead of the track. Lot's o' fun!

I saw a cartoon in a bike shop maybe fifteen years ago in which one character was telling another, "A serious cyclist is someone who can wear those clothes with a straight face."
 
Shortly after, I heard a rider at a local caf? say, "As much as I enjoy the circus, I don't want to look like I work for one."
 
The choice of clothing people make doesn't bother me. What bothers me is when they look down their noses at other bikers who don't make the same choices, or ridicule them for it.

....I had a sticker on the side of my Orange Foam Shell saying Ride Naked. Never dare do it. Suppose I had to get out 

And no one peeked inside to see. 
Hmmmm I wonder why?

What you've observed triggers an odd thought. Coats and jackets keep us 
warm. That's their original and best reason for existing.  But 
strangely, the typical modern office coat for both men and women has 
evolved to be something worn only in artificial climate controlled 
conditions.

 
When I'm outdoors in moving air, such as on a bike, I rarely get wet 
from my own sweat even in the hottest temperatures. It's only after I 
walk indoors immediately after a physical exertion that sweating becomes 
an issue to contend with --- like dripping a puddle of water from my 
arms onto somebody's desk, counter top or pickm'uptruck. 

Red face time. Big time.
