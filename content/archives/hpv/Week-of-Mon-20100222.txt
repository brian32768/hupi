Nice concept, since I know bike specific freeways are not on the horizon using alt streets has been a good strategy for bike commuters even here in Phoenix, a sorry place for riding vs anywhere in the Pacific NW. 

 

What's missing is why to use them, the people that created them here didn't think it through and that's why they leave you with big gaps in transportation routes getting anywhere you need to go.

 

So, alt streets need to be a part of a master plan to move people on hpvs to get them somewhere, here they put them in but seems never seriously considered bikes as transportation so nothing goes anywhere, and, since this place was created by land developers, it's not exactly easy in a car to get anywhere either ... lol!!

I think what Portland is exploiting is a pre-war street grid.  In  
typical pre-war street grids, the side streets went through.

Post war development has favored super grids. Side streets do not go  
through. It is cul-de-sac land.

Obviously most N Am cities have some areas that are pre-war, but  
sometimes more recent development, especially freeways, has broken up  
the grid.  Several of the streets I've tried to ride in downtown Miami  
have freeway on and off ramps that require me to deal with some fast  
merging cars.

I also think that this is a bit black & white, though I take your  
point.  Many of my neighbors and colleagues here in SW Germany never,  
and I mean never, take a bike for anything, and many here also view  
bikes as toys, as fun, as sport.  I grew up in Sacramento, CA, which  
has had a pretty nice recreational trail network for years, and quite  
a few large streets with good bike lanes.

.....Oh damn - that is unsettling news. I guess the market place has gotten to these folks too. 
Most  of my travels were in the more northern parts of Europe where I did see a lot of bicycle use. 

Anyway thanks for the information..

Message-ID: <4B89268B.2060907@att.net>

A customer contacted me to ask about a choice of car rack to carry his 
USS Street Machine.  Car racks aren't my specialty, not having a car, so 
I thought I'd run this question by the group.

He needs the kind of rack that attaches to a rear tire, as carried on 
the back of a Jeep.  Often anything will do with a SWB like this, but if 
  anyone had any sort of experience in this matter I'd like to hear it.

If the customer has a Jeep, I'd recommend a hitch mounted rack. The J&B 
Sun/Hollywood recumbent hitch rack is reasonably priced and works well. I 
use it with all kinds of recumbents, including several kinds of SWBs, LWBs, 
lowracers, and a SpeedMachine. It's fit them all. It's rather heavy, but 
it's sturdy. It sticks out far enough on my RAV4 to clear the spare tire on 
the back.

I have no experience with spare tire mounted racks, but the few I've seen 
haven't been very serious racks. If the Streetmachine is USS, it will be 
hard to carry it on most racks without wheel trays. Wheel tray racks work 
really well with recumbents. I think Charlie from ATOC is on this list; he 
can tell you how his racks work with SpeedMachines and Jeeps with spare 
tires on the back. I'd be shocked if he didn't have a nice solution.
