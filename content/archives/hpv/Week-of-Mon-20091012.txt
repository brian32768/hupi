There are actually a wide range of widths within some of those. 700C
Marathons come in a range of sizes from 25mm to 42mm or so. But it's
worth noting that they optimise the compounds for each size so you
won't get identical-except-size tyres even so. Still worth the
experiment IMO.

What you can do with the exact same tyre is use varying rim widths.
I've worked with someone who was convinced that very wide rims with
consequent flattening of the profile reduced rolling resistance, so
he ran 40mm or wider rims with the narrowest tyres that would fit
them. I think it would be worth trying at least a couple of different
rims with one tyre if you can - and now that 29" MTB is getting
popular you should be able to get 19mm, 25mm and 35mm 700C rims
without too much hassle. Getting a 40mm Marathon onto the 19mm rim is
left as an exercise for the experimenter :)

I think it'd be worth asking Schwalbe for support on this too, as
I've noticed them participating in other similar research. Even just
flicking you a bunch of tyres would help a lot.

 From what I understand of various tests done at "Bicycle Quarterly"  
sidewall suppleness and tread-thinness are critical for low  
resistance and optimal suspension in wide tires.

I guess that most wide tires today are made for lower performance.  
Like, aren't Marathons an extra-stout touring tire with thick tread?

They say that wide handmade tires were used for top performance on  
French bikes from 1930's-50's. They tended to be 650B in size and  
maybe 38-45mm in width. Also, wide tires apparently haven't been made  
in that quality since that period.

The closest it seems that we can get today are in the revival 650B  
tires by a few off-brands like Grand Bois and Mitsuboshi.

It looks like Dugast makes a 27mm tire high quality sew-up.

Well, I would think they would've tested their tires -- or at least  
used them -- at various pressures and noticest what they did to  
watts / effort.

Yup. The alternative is Kojaks but I'm not 100% sure what size range
they cover. You can get them in most racing sizes, I'm just not sure
about the 700C ones. I'd have to do actual research to find out and
that's out of the question :)

Hmm, website says there's few useful sizes for this test:
32-349  16 x 1 1/4
32-355  18 x 1.25
32-369  17 x 1 1/4
35-406  20 x 1.35
35-559  26 x 1.35
50-559  26 x 2.00
35-622  700 x 35C

Only dupes are in 26"/559. Marathon have the advantage that there are
six widths available in 700C:
25-622  700 x 25C
28-622  700 x 28C
32-622  700 x 32C
37-622  700 x 35C
42-622  700 x 40C
47-622  700 x 45C

>Again, I reported on a test and asked if any HPVers have tested wide,  
soft, supple tires.
The post had little to do with the test. I wondered about HPVer  
testing and experience. 

.......yes I have done a fair amount of on road coast down type measurements. A friend at Bell Labs did the bicycle physics and wrote a couple of spreadsheets and I did a few years of collecting data and testing the system. System meaning the physics, the spreadsheet math,  and a whole string of variables that had to be accounted for. 

Results  can be read on the WISLE site under Projects, then Hpv design, Test and building ,    Coastdown measurements by John Tetz. 
There are three sections. The first two are not accurate. The last one Quantifying Coastdown Measurements, the data is collected with a datalogger built by Kit Wolf from the UK. It made a huge difference in repeatability. 

In this write up I have reported on the variables that effect results (and there are many). 
Crr and CdA are relatively weak functions so things like tiny grades, and wind , temperature, clothing changes on un faired vehicles all mess with the results. Even tire warming during several runs affect results. I didn't do a lot of road surface variability measurements because so much of the time was accounting for other variables.  

I even saw what I believe to be a change in CdA vs speed (low  8 to 16 mph range) particularly on unfaired vehicles (FWD and Trike), but also on a shelled vehicle (Velomobile - not as great). The huge turbulent wake behind the rider on a unfaired bike must be changing characteristics quite a bit.  But even the VM CdA appeared to change.  This means one cant use a fixed value of CdA.   

My conclusion after around 4 years of collecting data is getting a reliable Crr number is very difficult. 

So maybe the roller method may give at least a  relative value. But what does a tire really do on a road surface? 

If your thinking of using a watts meter there are some issues that have to be addressed. Lets say the vehicle CdA is 2.5 sq ft, and the Crr is around .0045. I believe the speed should be low to reduce the influence of CdA. If the speed is low say 10 mph the Crr watts would be around 18 and the CdA watts 12. That's 37% and 57% of total power.  Any change in speed means the CdA is quite influential. At 11 mph the Crr is 53% and CdA % is 42. 
Trying to hold speeds to plus or minus 0.5 mph difference is difficult. One would have to do lots of runs and take an average. Will a watts meter read tiny variations? 
If the speed is higher then CdA is dominant. 

However a few years a go I was an official observer for the Varna team for the hour record up in Canada. When I got there they had been having trouble getting to 60 mph. Because I was just starting to do coastdowns I asked about the tires. They had been using a cheap tire but put on a high price "good" tire, so I suggested going back to the cheap tire. And they got the speed back.  
At 60 mph the Crr is 25% of total power and CdA was 70% yet that new tire created a problem. 
So maybe the system would show a difference. 

But if your doing a tire comparison there is daily temperature variations from run to run to deal with.  Absolutely no wind.  Don't forget calibration of the speed odometer vs tire circumference. . 

>From my experience you wont be able to come up with a Crr number but you might see a change in watts vs different tires. I will be very curious as to the techniques used and the results.  

I measured only three tires. Big Apples, Greenspeed Scorchers, and Primo Comets All fat tires at 60 psi. . All three were close with the Comets being a bit lower. But what was very noticeable was the ride quality. The Comets gave a much smoother ride. They are also thinner  - lighter so the acceleration is better. I have been running Comets  on all my 406 wheeled bikes. However for city use they probably would flat easier.

It depends- I was thinking that Marathon Supreme would be the closest analog to the Durano and the Big Apple. In the Schwalbe line-up there's 10 variations of the "Marathon" tire:

Marathon 
Marathon Cross
Marathon Extreme
Marathon Marathon Plus
Marathon Plus ATB
Marathon Plus Tour
Marathon Racer
Marathon Supreme
Marathon Winter (studded!)
Marathon XR

BTW: here's a direct link to John Tetz's coastdown article:
http://www.recumbents.com/wisil/tetz/coast_measurements.htm

And, Moz... yeah, I think Schwalbe would cooperate on this kind of comparison. All I need to do is find the time and patience to do it right.

I'd be interested in more information on the data logger that you used for these tests.  How does it work?  Would Kit Wolf be interested in making another one?

I agree with you on the merits of testing on the road vs on rollers.  I also think that it is important to have a rider on the bicycle (especially when testing on the road).  You can see this in the results when comparing tests run on rollers vs those run on roads.  The ones on rollers show that greater pressure is always better, while tests run on roads show that higher pressure (beyond a certain point) slows the rider down.

I've been involved with the tire testing for Bicycle Quarterly.  We have a strict methodology to get repeatable results across tests.  That includes testing at close to the same temperature (luckily Seattle has a very temperate climate), in zero wind, on the same test track.  We use reference wheels and tires (the tires are never used for anything else) at the start and end of each day to check that we are getting similar results.  The test rider is very stable in his weight, and we use the same test bicycle (also not used for anything else).

The iBike bike computers http://www.ibikesports.com/ do a decent job of 
calculating viable CdA and Crr values from calibration coastdowns. If 
one wants to get " super-gnarled" about having lots of sensor inputs, 
add the Cinqo which can communicate with an iBike unit

I don't know whether Kit still reads this list, but he's recently relocated 
from Newcastle to Aberystwyth and is also attempting to add reliability to 
the BHPC's race timing system.  Here he is, hard at work, at the BHPC AGM

That seems excessively heavy even for a trike with camera gear, batteries, transmitter, whatever.
