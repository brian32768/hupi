I did a major upgrade on the server and wondered if this list still 
works. There was dust all over it. :-)

Message-ID: <CAP9r-VTuCp+_We2x1OO8KdzDEwE1pu-V2FKULAnscJikaj86LQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been riding a recumbent thousands of miles a year for about 20
years.  I started riding a recumbent when I had a bad back, but now it is
fine, so I was wondering if I could fly up the hills with a lighter upright
bike.

I seem to remember an old Recumbent Cylclist News article where Robert
Bryant  said he got his hands on a great upright bike and started riding
it. Bob stopped using it because of pain in his hands, neck, back, and
butt.

Has anyone else on this who has not ridden an upright for many years tried
riding an upright?  How did it work out?

Thank you.

Andy

I originally switched to a recumbent when I started getting carpal 
tunnel symptoms.
I stopped playing synthesizer, started doing upper body exercises, and 
switched to a recumbent. I did not stop using a computer but I did 
switch from programming to sysadmin work for a long time.  All the 
symptoms went away.

I am back to riding uprights about 3/4 time. I have no issues switching 
back and forth.

I have a sweet Davidson Discovery. I can carry it up the stairs at work 
so it can be parked next to my desk. The commute is about a mile, and 
the Discovery is easy to handle around town. I use the Longbikes 
Slipstream generally only on rides > 10 miles / out of town.

I rode my Ryan Vanguard 100+ miles / week for years when we lived in 
Sonoma county. I do a lot more hiking here in Oregon because I don't 
like it when my bikes get wet.

How long were you riding a recumbent exclusively?

I rode recumbents for 99% of my miles from 1979 to 1999. Then I started riding non-recumbents and by 2009 less than 1% of my miles were on recumbents.

2 years ago I got a contract that required me to be on-premises several times a week. Their workplace is a long ride (for me--~60-70 min at an exercise pace) over OK-but-not-great, rather-congested (at least during rush hour), rolling-hills roads. Very occasionally I would ride my Stealth (which had been my exclusive ride for almost 20 years) all the way and back, but mostly my (outbound) commute was [upright ~10 min to transit stop, bus to stop nearest to workplace, upright ~10 min to workplace]. The bus bike racks do not well accommodate the Stealth (seat is too wide, 20" wheel is too small for clamp), hence the upright.

Main thing I noticed about the upright was not discomfort (though I suspect that's more problematic on longer rides) but speed: the recumbent is *much* faster.

Off this thread: if anyone knows about transit providers with recumbent-friendly equipment and practices, I'd like to learn.

Tom,

You said, "Main thing I noticed about the upright was not discomfort
(though I suspect that's more problematic on longer rides) but speed: the
recumbent is *much* faster."

Do you think you are slower on a upright bike because recumbents are
faster, or because your muscles are trained for recumbents.

The whole point of me riding an upright bike is so I can go faster.

Andy

>From doing an art frame that rode really well this is my new bike, it arrived early June and I ride these wheels in any wind conditions now as the HED has a parabolic trailing edge so lifts like a wing on the trailing half of the front wheel instead of steering you like "V" shapes which catch the what then is a leading edge to steer you in a crosswind. Not this one, you just lean into the a crosswind, didn't know that when I bought it but now have 1,400-miles using them all the time to where no way I'll switch back to standard wheels. The rear is a spoked wheel with a carbon cover, made for long TT's and sized to 24mm tires so I run those at 90-95psi which adds to the softer ride and rollout on rough pavement.
 
http://www.mallard-design.com/mdc2010/media/coyote-c005.jpg
 
The details on the frame include all internal cables, faired bottle bosses and it's really a work of art as a frame for a first-off, the fairing is steel, others will be frp or carbon as it added a lot of weight, full bike is 23-lbs from 4130 straight-gage and the next will be about 21-lbs from improvements learned and the lighter fairing. I jump curbs a lot and this thing eats any terrain and always feel under control at any speed. The tall headtube is intentional to help with high-speed tracking so it's like skiing, carves turns tighter if you want and discovering that with the art frame is what cinched wanting a good one.
 
Thanks for the upgrade Brian so had to add something.
 
Cheers, stormy and wet here in Seattle,

tom mallard

Design. Against the training argument:

* It's been 2 years.

* I'm riding upright more than recumbent.

* I have SPDs on both, so I suspect my pedaling action is similar for both. (Notably I pull on both.)

For the design argument:

* I feel the wind much less on the recumbent.

* the upright is a very-upright hybrid. I might get better results with a "real" road bike.

Dear Tom,

"the upright is a very-upright hybrid. I might get better results with a
"real" road bike."

I agree.
