Good morning,
Has anyone seen one of these Walmart recumbents for real?  We deal with lots 
of their other bikes so I have no illusions about what a $250 Walmart 
recumbent will be, but I was wondering if it's worth it for us to order one 
to keep around for test rides.  Our other 2 test ride bikes are worth a lot 
more so we'd like to sell them.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <4A1961CF.3080908@southslope.net>

Any suggestions for alternative clothes for cycling that are more normal 
appearing and functional off the bike/trike? The clothes would need to 
be breathable/wicking fabric, and need to have some pockets with secure 
closures for carrying keys/wallet/mobile phone, etc. that a non-cyclist 
normally carries. These would be used on either a bent or short rides on 
an upright folder, so the issues normal to upright cyclists do not apply.

The one suggestion from another forum I have seen so far is 
<http://www.columbia.com/performance-fishing.aspx>. Anyone try these 
while cycling?

I'm waiting for my summer supply of Boosucker shorts, and am writing 
this in shorts from two years ago, after riding to work in my Versatile.

For tops I like Smartwool long sleeve shirts, which I wear at work as 
well. Best of all, these clothes don't stink.

YMMV, of course. Elrey in Orange County

I don't know if you consider it "normal" but for cycling I've been  
wearing shirts and pants from here for several years:

http://www.sunprecautions.com/

Wore it on RAGBRAI when I was still doing it.  Of all the weird stuff  
you see, nothing freaked people out like the sight of me wearing long  
sleeves and long pants.  I got tired of trying to stay greased up  
with sun screen, and I am not convinced that covered is hotter than  
not in full sun.

If they work well on RAGBRAI, that is a good endorsement, since I am now 
living near Toronto (Iowa, not Canada), where direct sun, heat and 
humidity are common for much of the year.

Since I am an engineer, I can probably get away with wearing clothes 
that most professional office workers can not. The "Musa" pants look 
promising.
