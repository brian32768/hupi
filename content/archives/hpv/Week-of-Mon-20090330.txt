This seems to me to be exactly what Al suggested, John. I guess this is the way 
to go if you can do without electric braking.

We still have this problem: if you do require regernerative or at least 
electrical resistive braking, you cannot use a freewheel. If you don't use a 
freewheel (or one-way clutch), the motor has to turn all the time. This doesn't 
matter so much if:

1) the vehicle is mainly a motor vehicle, like the Twike, or

2) the motor is direct and brushless, like some hub motors (Bionx?), so that 
there is little appreciable resistance from the motor when it is not connected 
electrically but still being turned.

I have been chewing on this problem for 24 years now. You really need a 
freewheel which can be locked for braking. I did indeed buy one which was made 
for fixed-wheel bicycles, i.e. to have the option of fixed wheel or freewheel, 
but I never actually used it.

As an owner of an e-assist velomobile, with the motor driving the cranks, I
can say that it is probably the best method to get either top performance or
top economy from an electric motor on a bike.  My velomobile was (and is,
with the new owner) equipped with a Stokemonkey system. It drives the left
side (via a tandem crank) of the bottom bracket with a freewheel on the
motor. When the motor runs, the operator must pedal, but the operator may
pedal and the motor freewheels.  Some people dislike the idea, but it worked
great for me and allows for continual human assist. Clipless pedals are a
must, for safety reasons.

Cyclone systems are similar, but drive the right side and have a no-pedal
freewheel for those inclined to let the motor do the work.

Electric motors are most efficient in a narrow rpm range and most powerful
in a slightly lower, but no less narrow rpm range. By running through the
cranks, you can select the best rpm for either your climbs or duration
requirements. I picked the left side gearing ratio to give me the best
efficiency rpm at my mid-range to high-range cadence, and it fell into place
that best power dropped into the same range as my climb cadence.

Some e-bike operators will post figures of 10-15 watt hours per mile, but
one would suggest that means not quite as much pedaling as the Stokemonkey
system. I never saw double digit figures and managed to bring in five to
seven watt hours per mile in my velomobile. Aerodynamics played a big part
in the low figures, of course.

The Stokemonkey has incredible torque and will buckle frame tubes if not
well braced. Todd from clevercycles.com may not want to sell a system, for
other than the Xtracycle for which it is designed, as my velomobile was an
experiment that went quite well.  It's also pricey, but on a par with the
BionX in my opinion.

If you have pieces and parts from another system and can engineer a
Stokemonkey or Cyclone system into your bike, you'll find it rewarding in
all ways.  You'll likely be able to bias the weight forward on the slippery
front wheel, but put the traction to the rear where you need it.

I'm not against hub motors, but I believe that a crank-based system has so
much more going for it.

Keep us updated on your project and progress.

Subject: [hpv] LWB and batteries

Since I have been diagnosed with tachycardia (occasional bursts of high
heart rate) I am on beta blockers and can no longer climb the steep hills in
Seattle  (BTW I highly recommend riding with a heart rate monitor.  That's
the way I discovered my tachycardia).  I have been thinking about where to
put an electrical assist on my bike.  I am 6 ft 3 in with big feet, so I
prefer LWB bikes in order to avoid heel interference problems that I have
encountered on SWBs.  So I ride an old Infinity USS LWB (Avatar type).

Where to put the electrical assist, such as a BionX.  I could put it on the
20 in front wheel, with the battery pack up front.  This might help with the
main drawback of LWBs:  the poor weight distribution and the lightly loaded
front wheel, which breaks free so easily.  But would I have enough traction
up there to prevent slipping on a wet uphill climb (when I need it most)?

Alternatively I was thinking of building a USS LWB frame around a pedelec
unit salvaged from a Giant LaFree Lite up front assisting my pedaling at the
crank.  I would also mount the battery up front to help with the
aforementioned weight distribution problem.  Comments?

There was a person by the name of Peter Sharp back in the early 1990s who was a kind of leader on the subject. He wrote about the merits of such systems and tried to get people interested,  to no avail

He even proposed detailed rules for IHPVA races that could include human power derived energy accumulators. 
But the racers wanted nothing to do with this. 

Had there had been an interest back then by now we probably would have some results to show and talk about. 

My last known address of Peter Sharp is 2786 Bellaire Place, Oakland Ca, 94601.

Message-ID: <49D173F2.5010908@att.net>

I'm posting this to the HPV list since I know it reaches some people in 
Europe who are into bicycles.  Some might be able to help directly or 
else make inquiries.

I'm looking for a European bike parts wholesaler (I'm in the US) for 
occasional purchases.  I'm sure there are plenty of them out there, but 
they are not easy to find.  If anyone on the list knows contact 
information for one I'd appreciate it.  I do run a real bike shop.

I've meant for years to find one mainly because SRAM does not support 
its DualDrive hubs very well here in the US.  Repair parts are available 
in Europe (so they say), just not in the US.  The 3-speed rotary DD 
shifter is getting hard to find.  They have just discontinued selling 
the disk brake version of the DualDrive in the US.  If I want this stuff 
I'm evidently going to have to import it myself.

Message-ID: <49D1B53E.80200@worldnet.att.net>

Theo,

This first bit is in response to the notion of using a hub motor as a 
clutch, when without an electric load.

Svend Nielsen of Sweden created a website at 
http://www.svendus.se/goldenmotor/index.html  His page shows still 
photos of a two-wheel trailer with the left wheel equipped an electric 
hub motor. The right wheel has a standard hub which can be seen in the  
YouTube video; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooTwoJeEVxE  A flat topped 
cargo-box such as on Svend's pusher trailer looks a natural place to 
incorporate a solar panel.    It might be a pricey experiment using a 
similar trailer to compare using one hub motor to using two hub motors 
for the purpose of regenerative braking. One motor might work for some 
regen ability, even when asymetric, or not...
 
The Aevon is a single wheeled bike trailer, bigger than a BOB. If I 
recall correctly, the website hinted that it is possible to use a hub 
motor wheel to create a pusher trailer. "IIRC" because the URL was 
active earlier today, but not active at this moment; 
http://www.aevon.eu/pages/aevon_bicycle_trailers_english.html

Yours is likely the solution of brilliance, e.g., least complex and most 
functional. One might start with the single-speed coaster brake hub, put 
it on a single-wheel trailer which also carries cargo, then make a chain 
connection back to the motor/generator. A simple approach could be to 
start with an Adams Trail-A-Bike, or similar, then modify after  
removing the saddle, handlebars and drive train .  
http://www.trail-a-bike.com/product/   Used for its intended purpose, 
the Trail-A-Bike might be recognized as being an occasional low-power 
assist.

I wonder though, with a pusher trailer used for regen if there would 
there be an effective minimum weight requirement?  Too light, implies 
the trailer's wheel or wheels would skid across the pavement instead of 
rotate when braking.

Cheers,

John Snyder

Yes, there  is a least 1/2 of a list member who does.   I alternate 
between dial-up and wifi because of living in a rural area.  There was 
no harm done with the long quote. It was no big deal.

 I like the notion that everyone -- everyone --  is allowed five free 
mistakes a day, and that the mistakes roll over and never expire if 
unused. Trivial itty-bitty things count as one-hundredth of a mistake, 
AKA a real doozy.  That roll over feature is especially useful. I like 
the approach mostly because I commit at least two or three real doozies 
a day without even trying . <clears throat>

Sometimes, not nearly often enough, accidents can become important 
opportunities,  forces of creation.  If Alexander Flemming hadn't made 
the mistake of not washing his glass ware before going on vacation, he 
likely wouldn't have discovered penicillin mold.

The points are not only 56k Modems but general resource efficiency, usefulness, 
archiving and searchability.

General resource efficiency:
Mailing lists live on servers, are stored by members, cached by all sorts of 
machines, and transferred all over the place. This adds up to a lot of resources 
used even if videos use a lot more. On a personal level, 20k messages instead of 
2k messages use up disc space ten times quicker, and discs are often nearly 
full, no matter how big. The general problem is like with a lot of things, that 
those people using the resources heavily aren't those who have to pay for them. 
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons )

Usefulness:
Not removing quotes greating reduces readability on mailing lists, especially if 
subscribed in the digest mode.

Archiving and searchability:
These messages are archived at lots of places such as 
http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hupi.org but also privately. If you have 
to wade through lots of repetitions to find something, you are less likely to 
find what you want. Even powerful search engines won't help when the same 
messages are repeated many times.

For all these reasons, Netiquette is these days *more* and not *less* important 
than in the early internet days. For just chatting, other media than mailing 
lists are more appropriate. Or, at least set up the mailing list to be private, 
i.e. only visible to members. But I guess this is not what most of us here want.

Best, Theo Schmidt

Specifically, the attention of users is limited and valuable. Your ten
seconds spent ensuring an appropriate subject line, proof reading,
tidying quotes and making sure your message is easy to read means that
every single list member saves a few seconds when considering your
message. Multiply that by 500-odd list members and you're saving the
rest of us a combined 30 minutes for your ten seconds work. Not to
mention that you're much more likely to get an answer to any
questions you might ask since people will grow to associate your
address with readable messages.

Or to put it another way, every rude or lazy so-and-so who can't be
bothered doing so costs the group a lot more time than they save
themselves.

Also consider those of us not on the digest who have filters to
automatically delete any message with "Digest" in the subject... if
you can't be bothered with your own message, why should I?

There is a nice assist solution for the Anthrotech trike.

2.0mm 49-strand brake cables in moto-sized housing were standard when
the MtB industry got going. Noodles, OTOH, are a recent answer to
cable routing problems. Does anyone know if there exists noodles for
these old-skool MtB wires? The collar for seating the housing would
have about 6mm ID. Thanks.

In the phantom-trailer concept it just has to brake its own weight, not that of 
the steering vehicle. I'm more worried about the heavily-laden end, in fact I 
would have an application right now: a neighbour uphill from me has some oak 
wood for me, very heavy. No way I can use my trailer downhill with my bike, it's 
just too steep laden with 100 kg or so; I can only just manage on foot and it's 
dicey. If it had an effective brake (evenly on both wheels) - whether mechanical 
or electric, I could use the bike. Hmm, maybe a Segway could be turned into a 
phantom trailer...

Slap on a couple of beefy BMX brakes on the trailer, set up the cable so
that it can be removed (tandem cables may be long enough), find a brake
handle where the clamp opens up to make it easy on/off.

The worry is cable stretch, to be practical for really heavy loads it may
take using hydraulics to get the pull back to where it's split by cables to
the two sides. Still worth the trouble but the brake handle with an opening
clamp may be harder to find.

hth,

Strap the load on so that it rubs against the wheels to act as a brake
for this short trip. Have someone with you who can slip a bar in front
of the trailer wheels whenever you want to stop.

Sticking with the topic at hand, here's a YouTube video from a gentleman
who has been exploring Phantom Trailers since 1985.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-DwQ5AAO9o&NR=1

Given this one specific task to bring home the oak wood, may I suggest
using human power only, but calling on some concepts from regen braking,
power assist, and the elegance of walking?  (Dang, Theo that sounds like
a fun problem to tackle.)

At zero speed there is zero watt needed for braking. There is also zero
watt of mechanical braking power when a wheeled vehicle is allowed to
accelerate to terminal velocity. In between these two speed extremes
there exists another specific speed which results in maximum braking
power. When plotting this concept out as speed by power, accounting for
slope, mass and other drag,  a bell-like curve appears. The peak of the
curve is that point where a heavily-ladened tandem's tires can explode
from rim-heating or a regen system would be producing its maximum output.

The actual values are not so important right now only the recognition
that at descent rates slightly greater than  0 m/s  and slightly less
than terminal velocity require minimal amounts of braking power in order
to sustain a constant rate of descent. Motion occurs when braking power
against gravity on a slope becomes greater than 0 watt, even by a few
"drops".

To apply this observation in practice, means going down a steep slope
with a  >100 kg cargo at the low end of the speed range, as near to
walking speed as possible, e.g., on the order of 1 m/s or even less. By
"steep", I tend to visualize slopes between 8% and 15%.

If one's descent speed seems to be increasing (a cycle computer might
not be of much help to monitor a crawling rate) the rider, pulls on the
brakes, or drags a foot, long before a run away could occur -- and
always keeping one eye alert for places and features on the side of the
road to intensionally run into in order to stop. Using lowest possible
braking power means the bike's brakes alone can be fully sufficient.

The super slow approach can also be applied to a hand cart without
mechanical brakes. It's a technique I use when doing
legend-in-my-own-mind Manly Man trailering chores. <smile>  If a person
want to try the technique, it's like a good idea to practice with modest
loads in the beginning.

Cheers,

John Snyder

Perhaps you can rig a mechanical drag brake on each wheel of the 
trailer.  When engaged, it would take some work on the cyclist's part to 
accelerate the load, even downhill.  When you get to the bottom, or at 
least past the worst of the decent, you could disengage the brakes and 
ride as usual.

I have a newly built heavy duty trailer with inertia brakes on it.
It's not rocket science... well, except the "don't use cheap caliper
brakes" part. But since it's four wheeled I am not particularly
concerned about balancing the brakes, so I have not bothered at all.
Conceptually it's fairly easy to do that though, it just adds
slightly to the mechanical complexity.

I've taken photos, I just don't have a web page for it yet.

The idea is that the trailer hitch telescopes, and as it compresses
that movement tensions two brake cables that run to brakes on the
trailer. The minor complication is turning that compression into
tension, which means running a post along the hitch from one part to
hold the cables.

In side view mine looks like this:


                 bar /------------------(2)
--------------------------    // (1)
<- to trailer        ==========================> bike
--------------------------

(1) cable outer ends attach to bike part here, run left to brakes on
trailer
(2) ends of brake cables attach to trailer here.

In plan view the bar is a T, for me that's welded solid but you could
get some brake balancing by making that pivot.

Much better braking can be got using cable operated disk brakes, but
that adds $400 to the $200 trailer... I'll do that if I really need
to, but right now I'm in the process of attaching V brakes instead of
caliper ones (the ones that came with the 16" front forks I'm using)
