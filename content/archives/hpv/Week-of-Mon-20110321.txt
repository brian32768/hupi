I got it.

Replies seem to go to the sender, not the list.  I'd prefer the latter.  
I had to explicitly put the list address in.

That is how the HPV list has always been setup, including when I hosted it on bikelist.org.  It keeps off list responses from accidentally going to the list.

I'm getting it, but gmail is sending the messages straight to my spam

I did that, but how many people actually carefully check the contents of
their spam folder before clicking on that "delete all spam messages now"
button, or even go to their spam folder instead of just letting gmail delete
it for them after x number of days?

On my email, some of the messages are coming through with a [BULK]  
tag, and that gets them into the spam folder.  I think I am using a  
Mac "email client"?

So, you assume most people do carefully check their "spam" folder then?

Rotator Recumbents is long gone, so I'm wondering if, e.g., they sold
their parts somewhere, if Steve's still got boxes in his garage. If
you know something about this, please pass it on. FWIW I see that

Tom:

As far as I know Steve is no longer providing support for former Rotator customers.

You could probably get all of this made for you by Easy Racers (ER).  Their seat stays use 3/8" solid aluminum rod, and they have clamps to match.

I have a pair of Pursuit seat stays that I cannot now use as they are too short for me.  (A frame modification required that I use longer seat stays.)  The top of the stay is designed to wrap around a 3/4" seat frame tube.

http://bit.ly/fSStcT

They're used and scratched in a few places, but they are not cracked or bent.  I can sell these to you for $50/pair, which is about half (IRRC) what ER charged me to weld up a new pair.

I don't have any machined clamps to spare, but I'm pretty sure ER has a stock of these and that they would sell you a pair.  ER typically use these with a 1/4-20 bolt, although that would fit an M5 bolt loosely.  They may have un-drilled clamps, too.  Just confirm the dimensions of the rod and bolt when you order.

I was unaware Easy Racers used parts like this. Not surprising since Rotator
built bikes for both ER and Lightning. My "composite" bike uses a BikeE
frame and a Lightning Stealth seat, and was built by Rotator so it has the
"pi" shaped bracket.

I was riding it in Scotland and pushed hard to take off and the legs on the
pi bent into a neat U shape, instantly giving the bike more of a lowracer
seating position. I was able to bend them up relatively straight and
continue riding, but have been reluctant to put power into the seat back
ever since.

Just passing this along. I vowed to build something stronger like maybe
using steel tubing instead of a solid rod on my return home but have never
done it. My power output has dropped so much since then though that I might
not be able to bend the stays like that again.

Easy racer doesn't use parts exactly like this, but they do use solid 3/8" rod on their Cobra seat.  They've been using the machined clamps for a while, although I think they subcontract the machining of those to someone else.  Rotator used similar clamps, but I don't know if Steve made them himself or not.

Steve was known for using tubing (e.g. hose) clamps and was often criticized by Bob Bryant of RCN.  Steve's hose clamps were actually high quality stainless steel, and they work well without harming the tubing.  I've never had a good hose clamp fail or prove inadequate to the job, except for the one time I overtorqued one of the small clamps when tightening it, stripping it out.

On neither my Rotator or Easy Racer bike have I come close to bending the seat stays.  Might have something to do with the angle of the stays and whether the stay is in-line with the force applied to the seat back.

Aluminum tubing 1/2" O.D. ought to be sturdy enough.  Steel will be too heavy or too thin.

Your bike will feel more high end if you call them "Jubilee Clips" 
instead of "hose clamps".

Or use plastic Cateye clamps like ICE does. Everyone seems to be happy with 
those. When you paint everything black, they look fine.

For future reference, we make several different 3/8" clamps for our 
underseat racks. One of them is a similar configuration to the seatstay 
clamps Easy Racers uses. All of ours use M5 bolts.

Someone should do a chart relating parts, their OEMs, and the
make/models for which they can be used. For that matter, dare one call
for greater standardization? But that's hijacking my own thread.

And the legs of my Stealth's pi-shaped seatstay are in fact 1/2" rod.
