<PRE>I did do an E-assist two years ago for the Portland OHPVA event. It proved 
to me that I was barking up the wrong tree. Some Points:

I wanted a simple addition without mechanical complications and had not had 
good luck using a tire drive system many years before which scrubbed too 
much rubber and used two big a lead acid battery. I was in danger of 
distorting my diamond frame had I hit a big enough pothole.

So I used a model aircraft electric motor, the biggest one I could find. 
With a 36v nominal(32V under load) driving a four bladed shrouded propellor 
mounted behind my shoulders in the space I usually have my tailcone fairing on 
my modified F-40. At full power this combination used 560 watts and 
generated enough thrust to propel me at about twenty miles per hour but would only 
accelerate me very slowly to about fifteen without pedalling. Quite 
inefficient.

More knowledgeable people there told me my problem was that the propellor 
and motor were designed to go 60 mph in the aircraft. I raced the twenty mile 
flat course at half power to get the most out of my two batteries which had 
to be switched out at half way. The average speed I maintained was not much 
better than the non- assisted speed I had done the day before for a ten 
mile race, but I could not have done twice the distance at those speeds without 
it.   I was able to do the front straight at 28mph without much trouble.

When I got back from that event I set to work on the inefficiencies. 
Finding a two bladed propellor of the same size, but optimised for a slower air 
velocity dropped my consumption down to 330 W for a little less static thrust, 
about 14.5N (3lb,4oz) I also abandoned the boundary air scheme of 
Goldschmied's for a more conventional ducted fan arrangement. I have yet to see a 
practical application of Goldschmied's work but his wind tunnel testing with a 
modified model of the Akron dirigible shape showed great promise.

For E-assist on my bike   the extra drag of the unpowered fan was not worth 
changing out the tailcone for a longer trip than one for which the 
batteries could provide continued assistance. My tailcone coast down tests suggested 
a new, longer tailcone was worth more to me than that strap on unit at a 
lot less weight.
