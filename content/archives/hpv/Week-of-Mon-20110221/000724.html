Yes, the fluid drives are really lossy for continuous output engines, could be a hydrostatic drive that steps down a certain amount, more like a fixed-gear, using a torque-sensitive design seems useful as when you gain speed on the flats it'll give more roll-out as torque goes down instead of winding it up for more.
 
Anyway with the superlight ideas at ounces for the engine &amp; tranny the choice is blow more fuel when you use it but it's relatively easy to make and it's superlight when you're not using it vs gearing where you'll way better mileage but at these rpm's how's durability on a bunch of tiny gears?
 
So, that tipped the scale on reliability and low-maintenence to a lossy fluid drive to a OTS model-shop engine where a small lathe &amp; milling machine can do the fluid drive &amp; shafting, mounts ... bet it can get to 4-oz, goal was 6-oz plus the alloy water-bottle fuel-tank ... includes a real muffler &amp; exhaust system to put these on the street.
 
... zoooom zooooom !!!
