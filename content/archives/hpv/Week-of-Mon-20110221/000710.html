&gt;<i> To keep the bike a nice ride, adding in an assist without powering the chain, no batteries, my sketches have a tiny RC model style engine of 3-4 hp, the shaft driving a cylindrical torque-converter to step down the high rpm's with the outside of that the drive-wheel to the tire for the assist, behind the bb is possible on many bikes, the seat-stays aren't very strong for this. The torque-converter means it'd add to your pedaling as mentioned.

If an engine was designed specifically for this would be best, just seems a best combo of least energy used, get up the hill with a load or when a headwind is blowing hard and not alter the bike at all.

</I>I think you could get by with a lot less than 3 to 4 hp (approx. 2250 to 
3000W), considering a world class time trial rider puts out about 450 to 
500W during an hour run.  Or did you mean 0.3 to 0.4 hp?
