</I>&gt;<i> Dear Ph T and HPVers --
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The IHPVA.org forums (and IHPVA.org site itself) need a lot more attention
</I>&gt;<i> and promotion. Without devotion and promotion, they won't ever take off. But
</I>&gt;<i> they still serve a different purpose than a mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> . bikelist.org was sponsored by www.hupi.org ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No no no! Bikelist.org is a project of Alex Wetmore. Many thanks again to
</I>&gt;<i> Alex for stepping in when a new home for these lists was needed!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dreamed up the individual hpv mailing lists on the sonoma.edu domain
</I>&gt;<i> around 1988 when most IHPVA people had no idea what an &quot;Internet&quot; was.
</I>&gt;<i> Later, the IHPVA.org domain name and sites were also created by me and then
</I>&gt;<i> later updated principally by Mark Newell until his passing and still
</I>&gt;<i> generally ignored by IHPVA organizers unless I said something there that
</I>&gt;<i> they did not like. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My reference to HuPI in the footer of the hpv-* lists was a vote of support
</I>&gt;<i> for HuPI.org on my part. Alas, HuPI has not taken off (yet).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> their ongoing project appears to have died in 2009
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm">http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Refer to the &quot;about&quot; page <A HREF="http://hupi.org/about.html">http://hupi.org/about.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It is just doing what it was created to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HuPI is successfully performing its principal mission, which was ensuring
</I>&gt;<i> that the HP Journal could be distributed initially as a CD and since then,
</I>&gt;<i> online. It never would have shown up on IHPVA.org now or ever without the
</I>&gt;<i> persistence effort of HuPI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IHPVA seems dead, but all I have to go on is ihpva.org and hpva.us. I
</I>&gt;<i> presume the HP Journal is dead too since the IHPVA.org archive ends with
</I>&gt;<i> issue 55 which dates to what, 2004?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The shared dream for HuPI is about having the breadth to cover any kind of
</I>&gt;<i> human power stuff from atlatls to cider presses... to (something starting
</I>&gt;<i> with 'z' goes here, please submit a paper :-) HuPI is inclusively about
</I>&gt;<i> human power in a world that desperately needs alternatives to fossil power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, the current version of IHPVA is about going down a hill in Nevada
</I>&gt;<i> once a year in a human power &quot;vehicle&quot; that rode as a passenger hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> miles to the event in a big fossil foolish vehicle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All due respects to Sam and company, but IHPVA is as irrelevant to me as
</I>&gt;<i> NASCAR. All recent press releases are about Battle Mountain or going in
</I>&gt;<i> circles taped into a streamliner, and I just don't care about it any more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The pettiness and factionalism that drove me away from IHPVA.org and
</I>&gt;<i> WHPVA.org also drove me out of HuPI.org for a breathing spell... maybe when
</I>&gt;<i> the mapping project I am working on for VHPA.org is done... but... lots of
</I>&gt;<i> other interests now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still and all -- the world event is in ITALY at MONZA this year!! I bet
</I>&gt;<i> they even have food I can eat there! Slow food for fast bicyclists?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I can be a hypocrite and load my little bike into a big airplane and
</I>&gt;<i> fly over there, and join hundreds of people who WILL show up under there own
</I>&gt;<i> power!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still dreaming --
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Brian
