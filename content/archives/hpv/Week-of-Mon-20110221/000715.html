Actually the book does cover a surprising range, but not &quot;all&quot; as John says, in
particular not his system. Quite a few commecially available low-power,
low-energy systems are described, and these tend to be geared toward low-speed,
low-range use, not the high-speed, long-range, intermittent use system. One 
system described ist the 1.9 kg Gruber assist for uprights, hidden in the seat 
tube, rumoured to be used by cheating racing cyclists...

3 hp (2.2 kW) is quite hefty. I guess you would need this for most fluid drives 
which are probably not very efficient. I think mechanical systems are more 
efficient. Matthias Wegman built bikes with the &quot;Tetz-philosophy&quot;. He used the 
surface of the rear wheel as an extremely wide-range CVT, the motor with a 
friction drive being able tro travel from near the hub (high gear) to near the 
rim (low gear).
