In this design 3hp was what I designed to, you may lose a full hp going up a hill with a load and a fluid drive, they aren't too great up hills that way, haven't done any math on this one but bet you can lose 30% as a worst-case. 
 
The trouble with the tiny engines is their high rpm's (many are 10k), a lower rpm tiny engine is more ideal to this purpose and could be designed, or maybe something is already out there. Designing to 1.5k/min is even hard, wheel rpms on a bike are pretty slow.
 
So a fluid drive solves the mismatch in rpms at the cost of heat from fluid friction in slip and cheap to make versus gearing, more expensive &amp; efficient, don't think there are many other choices that are non-battery.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To keep the bike a nice ride, adding in an assist without powering the chain, no batteries, my sketches have a tiny RC model style engine of 3-4 hp, the shaft driving a cylindrical torque-converter to step down the high rpm's with the outside of that the drive-wheel to the tire for the assist, behind the bb is possible on many bikes, the seat-stays aren't very strong for this. The torque-converter means it'd add to your pedaling as mentioned.

If an engine was designed specifically for this would be best, just seems a best combo of least energy used, get up the hill with a load or when a headwind is blowing hard and not alter the bike at all.

</I>&gt;<i> I think you could get by with a lot less than 3 to 4 hp (approx. 2250 to 
</I>&gt;<i> 3000W), considering a world class time trial rider puts out about 450 to 
</I>&gt;<i> 500W during an hour run. Or did you mean 0.3 to 0.4 hp?
