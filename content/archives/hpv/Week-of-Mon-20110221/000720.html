<PRE>With regard to velomobiles, I note that the German Wind Explorer team seems 
to have gained some recent publicity with an electric vehicle trip across 
southern Australia where they kept energy records and utilised wind assist 
when it was practicable. Their vehicle appeared to me to have been cobbled 
together from a pair of velomobiles. Side by side with a set of tubes down the 
middle for a wind turbine-on-a-pole charging apparatus and an inflatable 
surf-sailing device for when they were on the road. Vewy clever. 

They did not have pedals to use but I suspect wrangling that sail to keep 
it from tangling with the side of road protuberances used a modicum of sweaty 
human power along with the nightly ritual of assembling that turbine. They 
seem to have made about 32mph(52kph) average speed on the flats IIRC.

So... I did a little calculating. My ride across the U.S. also had wind 
assist. The airfoil shape of my modified F-40 allowed me to sail for miles and 
miles   some of those days at 20mph (32kph) sans pedaling while on the flat. 
  On most other flatland traveling (West to East) I benefited from wind 
assist at a lower level even if the road direction did not carry me at the 
optimum sailing angle. Per John Snyder's Land HPV Force and power 
calculator(thanks John), for a typical 11 mph relative wind of 230 degrees compass bearing 
to direction of travel, and assuming his calculations are appropriate for 
the shape of my bike as a functioning sail(a stretch,perhaps) I used less 
than half the energy that they did, but at lower speed as well. All 104 watts 
were coming from my legs, no motor or wind charging necessary. 

I never did more than 150 km in one day where they were able to go as much 
as 400 km in a day on their 8   KW/hr battery pack and claim an average of 
2KW/hr for 100 km. That performance is better than the automotive x-prize 
winner would do at the same speed: 2.3KW/hr but the x-prize vehicle would hold 
four and was half again as heavy. It was also much faster.




&#8220;God has cared for these trees, saved them from drought, disease, 
avalanches, and a thousand tempests and floods. But he cannot save them from fools.&#8221;
