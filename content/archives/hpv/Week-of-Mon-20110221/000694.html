Dear Ph T and HPVers --

The IHPVA.org forums (and IHPVA.org site itself) need a lot more attention
and promotion. Without devotion and promotion, they won't ever take off. But
they still serve a different purpose than a mailing list.


&gt;<i> . bikelist.org was sponsored by www.hupi.org ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No no no! Bikelist.org is a project of Alex Wetmore. Many thanks again to
Alex for stepping in when a new home for these lists was needed!

I dreamed up the individual hpv mailing lists on the sonoma.edu domain
around 1988 when most IHPVA people had no idea what an &quot;Internet&quot; was.
Later, the IHPVA.org domain name and sites were also created by me and then
later updated principally by Mark Newell until his passing and still
generally ignored by IHPVA organizers unless I said something there that
they did not like. :-)

My reference to HuPI in the footer of the hpv-* lists was a vote of support
for HuPI.org on my part. Alas, HuPI has not taken off (yet).

their ongoing project appears to have died in 2009

Refer to the &quot;about&quot; page <A HREF="http://hupi.org/about.html">http://hupi.org/about.html</A>
It is just doing what it was created to do.

HuPI is successfully performing its principal mission, which was ensuring
that the HP Journal could be distributed initially as a CD and since then,
online. It never would have shown up on IHPVA.org now or ever without the
persistence effort of HuPI.

IHPVA seems dead, but all I have to go on is ihpva.org and hpva.us. I
presume the HP Journal is dead too since the IHPVA.org archive ends with
issue 55 which dates to what, 2004?

The shared dream for HuPI is about having the breadth to cover any kind of
human power stuff from atlatls to cider presses... to (something starting
with 'z' goes here, please submit a paper :-) HuPI is inclusively about
human power in a world that desperately needs alternatives to fossil power.

To me, the current version of IHPVA is about going down a hill in Nevada
once a year in a human power &quot;vehicle&quot; that rode as a passenger hundreds of
miles to the event in a big fossil foolish vehicle.

All due respects to Sam and company, but IHPVA is as irrelevant to me as
NASCAR. All recent press releases are about Battle Mountain or going in
circles taped into a streamliner, and I just don't care about it any more.

The pettiness and factionalism that drove me away from IHPVA.org and
WHPVA.org also drove me out of HuPI.org for a breathing spell... maybe when
the mapping project I am working on for VHPA.org is done... but... lots of
other interests now.

Still and all -- the world event is in ITALY at MONZA this year!! I bet they
even have food I can eat there! Slow food for fast bicyclists?

Maybe I can be a hypocrite and load my little bike into a big airplane and
fly over there, and join hundreds of people who WILL show up under there own
power!

Still dreaming --

Brian
