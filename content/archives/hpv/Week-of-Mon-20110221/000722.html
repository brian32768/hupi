Thank you for your delightful off-topics! I had the same experience using an air 
propeller. Unlike yours, mine was custom-made for a human powered boat (see 
<A HREF="http://umwelteinsatz.ch/theo/WM99boote/aeroboat.jpg">http://umwelteinsatz.ch/theo/WM99boote/aeroboat.jpg</A> for a picture of this during 
the 1999 World Championships in Interlaken, showing Sam Meyer on AeroBikeBoat on 
the Lake of Brienz). It was about 2.2 m diameter and had adjustable pitch. It 
worked quite well on the boat. I later fitted it to a geared down 250 W motor 
and tried to ski with it. Like you I found out that it would keep speeds but had 
very little acceleration. Of course the resistance of skis on snow is higher 
than with wheels on asphalt. Also I had the thing in front of me and had to hold 
it in my hands. I hadn't reckoned with the huge torque, which needed all my 
strength to hold (50 cm long board as mounting). Also, I didn't have my arms 
free to use skiing poles, so the propeller had to provide acceleration from 
rest, at which point the efficiency is lowest.

Cheers, Theo
