&gt;<i>To keep the bike a nice ride, adding in an assist without powering the chain, no batteries, my sketches have a tiny RC model style engine of 3-4 hp, the shaft driving a cylindrical torque-converter to step down the high rpm's with the outside of that the drive-wheel to the tire for the assist, behind the bb is possible on many bikes, the seat-stays aren't very strong for this. The torque-converter means it'd add to your pedaling as mentioned.

.........I did all this way back in 1990 and presented a paper for the 4th Scientific Symposium in Yreka Calif. 

A model engine is not good. Its designed for high rpm, small bearing surfaces, poor carburation, needs cooling, crazy fuels etc. I used a 21 cc weed wacker engine which has all you need (and cheap) and I cut excess weight off it - things like the pull starter. Added a cog belt gear reduction so I could use a decent size friction drive which worked real well even when wet and did not wear out the tire. But its lossy something like 40% efficient which is ok with a IC system because you have so much power. To climb a hill you need .1 hp from the rider and .2  to .3 hp from the assist. 
It was geared strictly for climbing where you need the help the most so it was used intermittently. 
I was able to travel 1300 miles on one gallon of gas. 
The whole system weighed 6 pounds including fuel. 

I did a lot of long distance (1000 + mile) self supported touring in mountain areas such as on the East coast and Sierras. 

What I learned from  the IC assist I applied to my present  E assist which weighs 4.4 pounds complete.
