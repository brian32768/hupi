</I>We actually did get a number of articles by researchers these last 
years. Unfortunately none of them made it through the review process. 
One nearly made it but would have needed more work and was withdrawn. So 
I had to write the last article myself and I urge you to read it if you 
want to build a storm-proof bike shed. As I'm more into drystone walling 
than HPVs at the moment, it will get even more bizzare... So if you 
would prefer to read about things that move, please send articles! HPeJ 
isn't dead, just sleeping.

Cheers,
Theo Schmidt, Editor HPeJ
