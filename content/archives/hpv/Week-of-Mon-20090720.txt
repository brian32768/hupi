Elrey;  Excellent article on E bikes in China. 
 Interesting how they are using Lead Acid batteries. 
but I understand there is a limit to the amount of lithium available on Earth.

Thanks a lot.

I've been a member of the e-assist group on Yahoo, back when it contained useful information and intelligent discussion. Unfortunately, it's deterioriated into tiny battles between members. I'm also a member of a number of electric vehicle groups and lists.  The discussion of Lithium shortage pops up now and then, but it usually fades away. One post suggested that Lithium is quite plentiful and a Google search will return a fifty-fifty match of shortage/plentiful posts.

The China article is hopeful for the world, since the riders are choosing to not buy motor vehicles.  The limits are quite severe compared to those of many states in the USA. 12 mph max speed isn't very good and the weight of the vehicle is quite low as well.  Florida requires that the bicycle retain pedals, and that it cannot exceed 20 mph with a 170 pound rider on board, on flat ground, no human power applied. Luckily, both Florida and Texas have no other restrictions, so if you have an assist bike that will do 20 mph and then go faster with human bean tossed in, you can go faster-er.

My AAW velomobile (now sold) has a Stokemonkey installed, from CleverCycles, which runs through the left side crank, and therefore through the gears, allowing best efficiency and power when used properly. I was able to run 37 mph on flat ground and full human bean, but only for a short time.  Loads of fun, especially since the Stokemonkey requires that one pedal when the motor is engaged. Any other implementation just felt wrong.
