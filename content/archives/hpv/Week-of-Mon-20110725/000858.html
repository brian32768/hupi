It is easy enough to google up anecdotes on the other side of this,  
for example:

&quot;...With my 10 speed systems, I have to replace the chains more  
frequently as opposed to my 9 speed system that seems to have a much  
longer chain life. Also, chain wear places a big role in the life of  
your drivetrain components. My 10 speed bikes need the chains  
replaced, on average, every 2500 miles- 3,000 if I stretch it. My 9  
speed chains tend to last a good 3 times longer. I think that in the  
effort to make things lighter, a lot of the durability has been  
compromised. One of my riding buddies was shocked when he had to have  
his chain replaced at just under 3,000 miles on his Madone 5.2. He has  
a 1989 Klein with old Dura Ace 8 speed group and he replaced his chain  
for the first time around 19,000 miles because he thought it was time  
to. The chain never even gave him issues. He now replaces it every  
15,000 miles and has had no problems with that bike.&quot;

OTOH I believe Wipperman has done lab tests on their chains that show  
they last longer:

&quot;Wipperman claims it is 18 - 20% longer than the life of a Shimano 10- 
speed chain.&quot;

It may be that brand of chain is more important to life than chain  
width. It might also be the case that in a lesser brand, the narrow  
chains don't last as long as the wider ones. It might also be that we  
do not have enough information for a sweeping generalization one way  
or another.

I still don't see how it is that a heavier (or stronger) rider does  
not put more tension on a chain than a lighter one.

It is also my view that the bike companies slapping another cog on  
every year or so is a bit like the razor companies adding another  
blade. I appreciate that high mileage performance riders are  
apparently finding some advantages to this new set up, but inevitably  
this will trickle down such that those of us who will not find any  
advantage will have to deal with it anyway.
