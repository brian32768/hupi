I rode this bike a little on Saturday (I am in Portland for the weekend):

The frames are made by Flying Pigeon and the racks were made by Stites
Design (who many of us know as a builder of leaning trikes).  The
design is very similar to a Bakfiets.  The bike could have benefited
from a longer stem for me, the ride was very upright.  The stock stem is
short to work with the canopy on the cargo bike, but that isn't necessary
when running with a front platform.

The cargo area is shorter than a normal Bakfiets, but might be about
the same as the short model.

It handled nicely and felt pretty similar to a Bakfiets.  I didn't
carry any load, so I can't comment on how it feels with a load.  The
racks were well made, but I'm not sure how I feel about the double
decker setup.  The front brake wasn't very good, but it sounds like
they are going to switch to a disk brake on future models.

It's an interesting bike and the basic models are the cheapest Long
John or Box bike type bikes that I know of.
