Although the rod brakes look VERY cool, it is good to see that Joe-Bike is replacing the brakes for the US market.  These bikes are infamous for their lack of stopping ability even in Beijing (a very dry, flat place).  

The bike frames will last forever, even under stresses that &quot;normal&quot; US riders would never dream of placing on a bike.  One example I have seen was a rider that had a refrigerator strapped on to the bike, which also had flat tires and a missing pedal block (but did have the pedal axle).
