<PRE>
I'd appreciate suggestions regarding means by which to carry both my
Lightning Stealth SWB and a conventional upright bike on a Toyota
Highlander. Why I ask:

I've hooked up with a woman who bike-commutes daily and occasionally
bike-tours. We're thinking about taking a trip which might be too long
for us to do entirely by bike, so we're thinking about driving (with
her Toyota Highlander mini-SUV) the bikes to the destination and
biking around there. I've never bought a bike rack before, much less
one to carry both a recumbent (my Lightning Stealth SWB) and a
conventional upright (her Miyata road bike), so I'd appreciate
suggestions (either via the list or direct to me) on what to look for,
etc. FWIW we're in central NC (Carrboro) so we have, e.g., a
Performance outlet, an REI, and several LBS nearby, but there aren't
any serious recumbent shops in the neighborhood. (The closest of the
latter of which I'm aware is Neighborhood Transportation in
Lewisville, which isn't too close.)
