&gt;<i> Okay, let's have a show of keyboards. Who biked to work today - on 
</I>&gt;<i> any type of bicycle?
</I>
With the Wisconsin weather turning better, I am currently blessed with an
8 mile commute by bike to the jobsite.  This is rare - usually in
construction I am going 30-50 miles daily one way.   So I get to commute
by bike for now!   Right now, weather wimp that I am, that's 2-3 days per
week, on the yellowbike2 (TE clone, somewhat altered geometry).    I love
the early morning sunrise from the bike path!   Wisconsin and Milwaukee
listen to a different drum on Bike-to-Work - the Wisconsin Bike
Federation has set June 7-12 as Bike-to-Work week.   And I certainly
will, IF I am still working at that point.   

Heck, if I am not on the job, &quot;work&quot; is in the toy shoppe out back MAKING
bikes.   I can't regard that as work (too much fun), but if that is the
full time 'gig' for a while, I most certainly will bike FROM work when
the sunlight calls me.   

Cheers!  ADC
