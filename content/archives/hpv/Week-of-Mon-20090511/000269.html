<PRE>Try a Draftmaster. We can easily configure a Draftmaster for either a 2.0
inch or 1.25 inch receiver, and carrying 1 SWB recumbent and 1 upright bike
is an easy fit for our HR-2 configuration. Draftmaster racks feature a quick
connect, modular design so removal for storage and/or to reconfigure for
different carrying needs is fast and easy.

All Draftmaster and Topper Racks are made in the USA at Atoc's factory in
the Seattle area, by our own employees.

Atoc is a manufacturer so we prefer that you buy our rack systems thru one
of our dealers when possible. If we do not have a dealer in your area (and
we do not have a dealer in the Carrboro NC vicinity at this time) you are
welcome to order directly from Atoc.

For more info see www.Atoc.com or www.Draftmaster.com, or give us a call at
(800) ATOC-021. Our phone hours are 9-5 M-F Pacific time.

If you will all excuse me, now I have to go get ready to pedal to work.
After all, it is Bike To Work Day! Yes, I ride to work more often than just
BTWD.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd appreciate suggestions regarding means by which to carry both my
</I>&gt;<i> Lightning Stealth SWB and a conventional upright bike on a Toyota
</I>&gt;<i> Highlander. Why I ask:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've hooked up with a woman who bike-commutes daily and occasionally
</I>&gt;<i> bike-tours. We're thinking about taking a trip which might be too long
</I>&gt;<i> for us to do entirely by bike, so we're thinking about driving (with
</I>&gt;<i> her Toyota Highlander mini-SUV) the bikes to the destination and
</I>&gt;<i> biking around there. I've never bought a bike rack before, much less
</I>&gt;<i> one to carry both a recumbent (my Lightning Stealth SWB) and a
</I>&gt;<i> conventional upright (her Miyata road bike), so I'd appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions (either via the list or direct to me) on what to look for,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. FWIW we're in central NC (Carrboro) so we have, e.g., a
</I>&gt;<i> Performance outlet, an REI, and several LBS nearby, but there aren't
</I>&gt;<i> any serious recumbent shops in the neighborhood. (The closest of the
</I>&gt;<i> latter of which I'm aware is Neighborhood Transportation in
</I>&gt;<i> Lewisville, which isn't too close.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TIA, Tom Roche &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv">Tom_Roche at pobox.com</A>&gt;
