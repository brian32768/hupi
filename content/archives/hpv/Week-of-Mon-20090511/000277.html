I'll second that.  I have a Draftmaster that I bought several years ago
when we bought a Rans Tailwind for my wife.  With the tandem tray, we
could carry her bike, my VRex, and the kids uprights.  Overall it's a
great system.

However, the kids are now gone and my wife's knees are shot, so I don't
have much use for it anymore.  So not to take business away from Charlie,
if anybody is interested in a used rack and wants to come to Boise to pick
it up, I've got a 5-bike carrier that I can sell.  I'm keeping the tandem
tray though.  It works on top of the pop-up trailer and I keep hoping that
my wife will be able to ride again someday.

Why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle?
