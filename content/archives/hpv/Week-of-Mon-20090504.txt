The Vision has a fairly high CG, so that is likely part of the tipping 
problem. A vehicle like this tips on a line between the outermost wheels, so 
having the outrigger wheels behind the rear wheel angles the tip line closer 
in. The best place, tip-wise, for the outriggers is due outside to slightly 
forward of the CG. This is because tipovers often involve braking while 
cornering.

I've done some stabilizer/outrigger wheels for people with balance issues, 
and another problem is high centering the drive wheel. This might be solved 
by suspending either the drive wheel or the outrigger wheels. You of course 
want to make sure you never high center the steering wheel!

The best overall solution, I think, is to go with a proper tricycle. There 
are enough options nowadays that you can find something ready made for a 
decent price that will probably do what you need with only minimal 
modifications. The trike rear section that Sun (J&B Importers in the USA) 
sells is a good option if you want to convert an existing bicycle. In order 
to provide spares, J&B sells any part of any bike/trike they make. Most 
shops in the USA are hooked up with J&B, so it's not too difficult to get 
stuff like this here in the States.

It's been a long time passing since I've looked at the IHPVA email 
lists. It got a bit crazy but still interesting in early 2000s, and HPV 
email moved to another email server clumsily. As a computer tech, I 
appreciated the problems, but was saddened to see things go downhill on 
the email lists.

A little later I was banned from using my Trice recumbent trike on the 
hometown job. I bought a motorcycle-sidecar outfit to at least get some 
fresh air on the job, and really cut back on cycling. (Employer requires 
a legal gasoline powered vehicle apparently.) The sidecar mc gets as 
good gas mileage as the latest "hybrids" around town and on the freeway, 
is lots more interesting for daily transportation, and in California I 
don't need a special "motorcycle license" to drive 3-wheel motor 
vehicles :)

20+ years of bicycling on public roads as an adult has taught me how to 
be careful on a motorcycle. The outfit is actually a little safer 
because drivers can "see me" (I don't look like a narrow sign or bush on 
the roadside), I travel at traffic speeds in a wide lane, I don't have a 
narrow 2-3' wide lane in debris to travel in, and crazy motorists are 
afraid to be nasty to me because I might be a "motorcycle gang member" 
and can catch up to them :)

Man, the mid 90's and early 2k's were exciting times for US IHPVA email 
lists. Lots of new tech and manufacturers coming out and mentioned on 
the various lists, from around the world.

I'm getting close to retiring, and will probably get a modern Trice 
(with rear shock) for around-town transport and recreation rides. 
Though, the sidecar mc outfit is pretty cool for quicker longer distance 
travel, and I use lots less non-renewable resources than driving my 6cyl 
Ford pickup.

I don't even know if this msg will get thru to the current email list, 
or deleted because it mentions "motorcycle" :)

Not just technical problems, of course. The IHPVA/WHPVA rift showed me 
that registrars/providers/hosts based in the USA - which unfortunately 
includes ICANN itself - and conforming to the USA legal system are risky 
to use for those with let us say a European-type legal outlook. These 
differences of opinion are certainly a factor which lead to frequent 
changes of addresses and servers.

Thanks for documenting this on your website (www.lenk.net)! Again, it 
seems to me a peculiar legal problem. I guess your employer can specify 
the vehicle to use if this is required to do your job properly, but go 
no further then that. Over here, a rural postman in private initiative 
delivers post with an electric scooter and trailer instead of the 
standard stinker, with support from the "post office", even though the 
scooter model he uses cannot legally pull a trailer. I guess you could 
have sued your employer, but would have been jobless afterwards.

I want to thank everyone who responded to my request for ideas.  I was so interested in how motorcycles had converted to trikes by adding outboard wheels that I really didn't stop to analyze if it would work on a recumbent bike.  I just went to work.  However, I learned a lot and had a lot of fun.  So now I will convert the frame and wheels into a trailer.

I built a wooden low racer a couple of years back that was a blast to ride and fun to build.  Maybe I can use the plans from Atomic Zombie's DeltaRunner Recumbent trike and build it out of wood.  http://www.atomiczombie.com/product-deltarunner.htm

Again, thanks to all.

GRR, Kettwiesel, Vision Metro and now a new trailer.

Good evening,
I'm a little starved for good pedal-powered news.  Forums are too much 
bother, what sites do the readers of this list favor?

So far I look at bentrideronline and this list.  Has anyone found others? 
(including subordinate lists to other sites - like human power on 
Alternative Transportation)

Thanks,

Hi Nick


Not HPV or Recumbent specific, but an excellent source of bikey stuff is 

www.blognetnews.com/cycling/

It is an aggregator (and the best that I have found) of non-racing cycling
blogs.  Probably possible to refine the feed that you would get ( I do mine
as an RSS feed ) or use the 'search' function.

What's wrong with forums, Nick? Our OHPV forum software:
http://www.ohpv.org/forums/index.php
allows email notification on particular subjects & threads. I also like that pictures can be posted in line with text- this makes much more sense to a visually-minded person like me. For instance:
