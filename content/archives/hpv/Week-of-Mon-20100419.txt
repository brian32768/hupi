I saw a real neat on at the HPV races in Ft. Lauderdale years ago.  I can't find a picture but it had folding pontoons.  Looked really cool.  Maybe someone in Ft. Lauderdale remembers and can get  you a picture.

To bring some HPV content back to the discussion:

If you were to attempt a one-hour record on this track and if you could 
somehow get a streamliner up onto the banking, you would be lapping 
once every three-quarters of a  second or thereabouts.

I'm not sure which would be worse - driving the vehicle or counting the 
laps ?

Good morning,
Anyone going to Spezi this weekend?  Any idea if there will be a place to see photos?  I just read the schedule/exhibitor list and it looks pretty good.

Nick,
i will travel to Spezi. Not only because it is an interesting fair but also to celebrate 25 years of German HPV. There will be a party as i understand correctly on saturday evening. I hope to bring something with me. The germans are great at letters of friendship, they manage to let them travel (by hpv) for thousands of miles across europe (Eustaff). I will bring something of friendship with me i hope from the dutch hpv group.
Anyway, i will make photos and collect all important material (again.. I hope) on www.ligfiets.net
So some time next week we should have something up there. Peter Eland from Velovision is also travelling there. 
I will make a post if something worth mentioning is up.
Jack Dekker
