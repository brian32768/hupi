I've seen people write that 10-speed chains don't last as long as  
wider chains. Well I just replaced the Wippermann Connex 10s1 10- 
speed stainless steel chain on my Bacchetta Aero after 23,762  
kilometres. One of my chain wear measurement tools indicated it is  
time to replace it while another tool indicated it was still in fair  
condition, not to the replace mark yet. The reason why I replaced it  
is because the chain has been getting noisier lately. Based on how  
long this chain has lasted, I replaced it with another Wippermann  
10s1 chain.

I am using Wippermann 10-speed chains on 2 of my other bikes, a SRAM  
10-speed chain on one bike and KMC 10-speed chains on 2 other bikes  
but as I divide my riding time between many bikes, I have yet to wear  
one of these out. The only maintenance I do on my chains is applying  
ProLink when the chain starts to get noisy and wiping off the excess.

(None of the parts rusting and falling off my bikes are 10 speed so I
am not qualified to comment but...)

Oh, how I miss California. Zach, you could simulate bicycling in
Oregon by soaking your chain once a week in a bucket of water mixed
with a little clay. Let me know how they hold up then.

I would also note that Zach is pretty light. Seems to me total weight  
of bike and rider enters into this?

Weight of the rider has nothing to do with it.  My 10-speed drivetrains are
lasting just as long as my 9-speed ones.

I remember when 9-speed drivetrains first came around.  A lot of people were
making the argument that they wouldn't last since it used less material than
the short-lived 8-speed or the 7-speed ones that may people were still using
at the time.  They made this argument without trying or without any
empirical evidence.  Does anyone doubt the durability of 9-speed components
nowdays?

How about you prove me wrong first.  Upgrade a bike to 10 speed, and ride
it.  See what your data tells you.  If you do get excessive wear, then feel
free to criticize  and point out how your logic is so much more valid than
mine and Zach's personal experiences.

Moz.  Please provide concrete proof that 10-speed systems are unreliable.
Until then, you can insult me all you want and I will continue to say my
actual personal experience with 10-speed components contradict your
theories.

It is easy enough to google up anecdotes on the other side of this,  
for example:

"...With my 10 speed systems, I have to replace the chains more  
frequently as opposed to my 9 speed system that seems to have a much  
longer chain life. Also, chain wear places a big role in the life of  
your drivetrain components. My 10 speed bikes need the chains  
replaced, on average, every 2500 miles- 3,000 if I stretch it. My 9  
speed chains tend to last a good 3 times longer. I think that in the  
effort to make things lighter, a lot of the durability has been  
compromised. One of my riding buddies was shocked when he had to have  
his chain replaced at just under 3,000 miles on his Madone 5.2. He has  
a 1989 Klein with old Dura Ace 8 speed group and he replaced his chain  
for the first time around 19,000 miles because he thought it was time  
to. The chain never even gave him issues. He now replaces it every  
15,000 miles and has had no problems with that bike."

http://forums.roadbikereview.com/showthread.php?t=239361

OTOH I believe Wipperman has done lab tests on their chains that show  
they last longer:

"Wipperman claims it is 18 - 20% longer than the life of a Shimano 10- 
speed chain."

http://www.trigearreview.com/forms/Article.aspx?REVID=275

It may be that brand of chain is more important to life than chain  
width. It might also be the case that in a lesser brand, the narrow  
chains don't last as long as the wider ones. It might also be that we  
do not have enough information for a sweeping generalization one way  
or another.

I still don't see how it is that a heavier (or stronger) rider does  
not put more tension on a chain than a lighter one.

It is also my view that the bike companies slapping another cog on  
every year or so is a bit like the razor companies adding another  
blade. I appreciate that high mileage performance riders are  
apparently finding some advantages to this new set up, but inevitably  
this will trickle down such that those of us who will not find any  
advantage will have to deal with it anyway.

Just internet chatter, but further down the link:

"... Light riders who don't do loads of hills will find their chain  
and cogs last a lot longer than heavy riders who ride hills all day.  
Cleanliness also helps with wear (note: excess lubrication attracts  
dirt, so cleanliness is not as simple as more oil)..."
