<PRE>If leg strength is an issue I would suggest an old Trice and adding a Bionx
and a hub motor but only a small battery. Use the assist only when you are
starting or challenged by a hill. When your strength improves you can ditch
the e-assist stuff at only a small discount. Lower is better with a trike.
Lower is more stable and you shouldn't count on being seen as a commuter
... always ride as if that pleasant person smiling at you does not see you.
If you have not encountered this phenomenon, you will. As for getting up a
low trike, it is easy to do. Use the last of your momentum to propel your
body forward to a standing position. Easy and fun to do.

Sabu was sad, the whole tour stunk
The airlines lost the elephant's trunk
The roadie got the rabies and the scabies and the flu
They were low on morale but they were high on
