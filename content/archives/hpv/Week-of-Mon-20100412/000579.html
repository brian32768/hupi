Zoomed 200% seems they had four lights, 2 from each side, the two on the right were more into the camera so appear brighter or may have gone off last, spokes are blurred, people aren't, looks real to me, the rider in front seems not on the track yet, the left rider is scoping him out to see if he's going to make the jump because he's pretty low on the track &amp; slow by how vertical his body is, the other two are up to speed; the track was really cleverly built to set up, light &amp; strong, the vertical strut was the pin to hold sections together, good detail of it in front.

</I>&gt;<i> Not only was it most likely real, but the photo is not retouched, though it 
</I>&gt;<i> was &quot;staged&quot; most assuredly. Keith's was a chain of Vaudeville theaters, 
</I>&gt;<i> later to be movie houses. Trick riding was a staple of such shows at the time. 
</I>&gt;<i> Stopping motion photographically with flash powder was quite common to the 
</I>&gt;<i> era as well, though for this shot it probably took a set of well placed 
</I>&gt;<i> flash pans with reflectors to get the flat lighting.
