<PRE>Hey Folks

The 2010 New England Human Powered Vehicle Rally is fast approaching (on 
May 8/9) - for this year,  in addition to the Expo and moderately paced 
ride on Saturday, there is also the opportunity to test yourself against 
the clock with the recumbent class (also open to velomobiles, tandems, 
etc.) in the Seacoast Time Trial.  This is a low pressure type of race, 
in which riders are released at 30 second intervals, and there are no 
packs or pelotons.

The purpose of the NE HPV Rally, now in it's 7th year, is to celebrate 
the potential for human powered vehicles as a practical, healthful, 
environmentally friendly and fun means of transportation. Previous 
Rallies have featured a wide variety of recumbents, velomobiles 
(enclosed recumbent cycles), electric assisted bicycles, homebrewed and 
store-bought versions of each of these, and more.

It is possible to register for either the NE HPV Rally Saturday, the 
Seacoast Time Trial on Sunday, or register for the whole weekend for a 
discounted price.  Registration prices go up after April 24, so if  you 
are planning to come, please register now to save money.

Free camping is available with your registration - if you do need to 
camp, please RSVP  by email (<A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv">recumbo at roadrunner.com</A>) or phone ((207) 
423-7360) in addition to registering via Bikereg (link below) as camping 
space is limited.

Hope to see some of you there!
