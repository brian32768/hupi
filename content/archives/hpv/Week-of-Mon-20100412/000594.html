My argument against powder is that it is used in lines that burn sideways, that will change the angle of the shadows as it burns and move the edge somewhat, but shadows are clear, distinct, so I don't think powder was used.

</I>&gt;<i> Good observations all, but I still think flash powder as the shadows are 
</I>&gt;<i> not nearly as stark as an arc lamp would produce. I worked in theater for a 
</I>&gt;<i> while, and did some theatrical publicity shots like I suppose this one to be. 
</I>&gt;<i> The flash powder was much slower than modern strobe units and one did not 
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily have the luxury of a fast shutter sync'ed to its peak brilliance. 
</I>&gt;<i> They would have had a longer shutter time to accomodate the variability, but 
</I>&gt;<i> short enough not to allow ghosting from general illumination.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the cyclists were in the middle of one of their routines, all in 
</I>&gt;<i> motion at varying speeds which included coming down through the flat and back 
</I>&gt;<i> up again in an epicyclic fashion. I think I also see the sort of pegs on the 
</I>&gt;<i> seat stays and other parts that would have been used for other tricks in 
</I>&gt;<i> a different part of the program. (Obligatory HPV content).
