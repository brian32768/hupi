Unless the three cameras were shuttered to go off at the same time, which is possible, I was thinking that there was more than one camera from the other shots ... seemed that they were too close in the same actions to get with plates if you were changing between shots.


Think it was arc lamps and a decent plate mix for shutters of the time, spokes are blurred, riders are much less, a photo expert should be able to use that to estimate speed and knowing roughly how fast plates emulsions of the era were, shutters were fast enough afaik, it was the &quot;film speed&quot; that was the problem ...
