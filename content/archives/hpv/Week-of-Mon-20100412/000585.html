<PRE>Good observations all, but I still think flash powder as the shadows are 
not nearly as stark as an arc lamp would produce. I worked in theater for a 
while, and did some theatrical publicity shots like I suppose this one to be. 
The flash powder was much slower than modern strobe units and one did not 
necessarily have the luxury of a fast shutter sync'ed to its peak brilliance. 
They would have had a longer shutter time to accomodate the variability, but 
short enough not to allow ghosting from general illumination.

I think the cyclists were in the middle of one of their routines, all in 
motion at varying speeds which included coming down through the flat and back 
up again in an epicyclic fashion. I think I also see the sort of pegs on the 
seat stays and other parts   that would have been used for other tricks in 
a different part of the program. (Obligatory HPV content).
