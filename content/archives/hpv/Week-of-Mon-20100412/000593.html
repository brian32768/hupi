At least one of the riders' heads is not in the same position in all  
three shots, so I don't think the images were simultaneous, and then  
it gets very suspicious that there were all in the exact same position  
on the track in all three photos.

Shutters were fast enough to stop action. Muybridge did a lot of it.  
But in daylight, I think.
