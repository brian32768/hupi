<PRE>I'd been assuming flash powder, but looking a the light coming from  
the sides, I don't think so. Might be arc lights? In which case, the  
action may have been stopped by the shutter.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not only was it most likely real, but the photo is not retouched,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was &quot;staged&quot; most assuredly. Keith's was a chain of Vaudeville

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> later to be movie houses. Trick riding was a staple of such shows  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stopping motion photographically with flash powder was quite common  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> era as well, though for this shot it probably took a set of well  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> placed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flash pans with reflectors to get the flat lighting.
