This past year an organized "race" was held in Holland bring together 
participants from around Europe. I put quotes around "race" because the 
vehicles are rather slow as of yet, being powered with wind, stored 
energy, human muscle, and use electric drive trains and other innovative 
approaches which list members may find fascinating.

The following web site is fairly extensive. Navigation links appear on 
the left hand sidebar. A good page to start from is

The level of innovation exhibited is awesome.

Cheers,

Thanks for the super link, John! At least the vehicle from Flensburg probably 
has a pretty sub-optimal turbine (too many blades). Actually the state of the 
art for land vehicles - at least models - is that it is possible to go downwind 
faster than the wind by using the rotary airfoil as a propeller, not turbine. On 
the mailing list of the AYRS (Amateur Yacht Research Society) this subject comes 
up every few years. So far nobody knows whether it could be achieved with boats. 
We think so, but nobody has yet built one. The opposite case - the headwind 
vehicle - is however easily done for both land vehicles and boats.

Theo,

The faster than tailwind concept is super cool!

Is it plausible to use a single rotary airfoil for both a propeller or a 
turbine? IOW, the operator would be able to use the same rotor as either 
a power input or a power output device.

Notice that Kiel University's vehicle employs an electric drive train. 
That neat arrangement suggests possible design opportunities for 
assisted HPVs which used natural energy sources exclusively .

Hi John,
Yes, you can of course use the same foil for both purposes, but if it is an 
asymetrical foil, as is usual, one of the applications will be the "wrong way" 
around, as for example with an airplane flying upside down. You must either 
design the foil to be primarly for the one or the other purpose - and accept 
poor performance in the "wrong" mode, or use a symetrical foil section. In this 
case the achievable coefficient of lift is rather limited, i.e. you need more 
surface.

The Amick wind car also used an electrical system even though the foil was a 
fixed wing like a sail, but unlike this even fixed in attitude. The idea was to 
sail in favorable winds charging the batteries and using the stored energy for 
propulsion in unfavorable winds. The Kiel University car is more universal as 
every wind is favorable. You don't need energy storage except for the case of no 
wind. The disadvantage is the safety issue of rotary foils on a street vehicle; 
I'm sure a road licence wouldn't be granted in most countries.

Cheers, Theo

Excellent analogy, the upside down airplane!

For a human-wind hybrid the choice between prop or turbine performance 
might be simple, already made for us -- go for the turbine.

Dealing with the headwind condition provides more benefit to a hybrid 
human-wind powered vehicle when average speed is put to the forefront as 
contrasted to highest possible speed. In those rare conditions when an 
out and back round trip happens with the natural wind coming from 0.0 
deg yaw relative to the road, the vehicle's average speed can never 
exceed a value twice that of when the vehicle is in a headwind condition 
(the slowest leg). Poor performance of a propeller when traveling in the 
downwind condition would have minimal influence on the trip's averages.

The same phenomena occurs when walking up then bicycling down a steep 
hill, such as a ski slope. No matter how fast the bicycle is able to 
descend, the entire round trip's speed can never exceed a value more 
than twice that of the trip's portion devoted to pushing and climbing. 
Crawl up at 2 mph, blister down at 150 mph, the sums of time and 
distance covered create an average speed less than 4 mph.

I had forgotten about the Amick car!!! Thanks for the reminder. Here are 
some images of the Amick car on the web, which took awhile to locate;. 
http://home.earthlink.net/~jameslamick/press/images_from_rna/index.htm

This raises the question. For a human-wind hybrid would it be tenable to 
place a horizontal-aixs turbine which pointed in a fixed azimuth? This 
HPV design does, but did not incorporate a traction wheel or appear to 
exploit a natural wind input. Maybe it does.

I assume (always dangerous)  the only advantage of the Darius rotor is 
due to universal wind direction -- doesn't matter where the apparent 
wind is coming from.

When using a sailbike it became obvious that the natural wind is rarely 
favorable because of availability, and to a lesser extent the apparent 
wind direction. If wind is ever is to become practical for road 
transport, wind power must be supplemented with other power sources such 
as stored energy or human power.

> You don't need energy storage except for the case of no

That no wind case happens frequently even in places characterized as 
being windy. The availability of a natural wind is intermittent and 
unpredictable, just as sailboats must deal with the extremes of becalmed 
or gale force storms. Energy storage would help dole out the available " 
natural energy income" to match desired "energy spending" rates.

I agree with you, safety is a very important consideration.

One possible approach for making a design safe in traffic, might be to 
contain a turbine's blades within a duct or shroud, such as used on jet 
aircraft.  A tiny example of a shrouded wind powered bike light; 
http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/07/a_double_whammy.php

Another approach might be to use non-bladed turbines. Here's a link to 
an interesting and unusual turbine design with a tongue twisting 
name;VERTICAL AXIS INVOLUTE SPIRAL DRAG PROPULSION WIND TURBINE

Nice! I especially like the bike made out of a brass bed.
