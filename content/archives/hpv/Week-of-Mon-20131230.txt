I see no reason not to encourage  the development of a performance delta.
  A low delta certainly has adequate stability  for any situations arising  in
road use
or HPV competitions.
This past year we produced 3 more Barracuda shells. Two are being completed
by other builders in the tadpole design.
   The third remains at my shop. I am currently doing drawings to render it as a
delta.
A single enclosed wheel up front   presents a lower frontal area than
any tadpole velomobile.The 4 inch ground clearence of the original Cuda will be
maintained
and provide more than adequate stabilty.
     I note that  Warren's  original Cuda is very narrow . The second Cuda that
I completed
was widened by Jeff Wills  for fit.
   Following  his lead ,  we made a second wider Cuda mold  this past summer.
Because of Warren's  height and the wider mold the result is a shell that will
fit a
large rider.
    As I would require a crane to enter and exit a  vehicle 4 inches off the
ground
I am seeking  an interested  younger rider to move this project ahead.
   At this point the positions and number of wheels is  optional.
