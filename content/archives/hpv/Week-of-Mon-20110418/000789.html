get two wheeled vehicles to the state of 'ease of use' that the  
general public will need in the future. Such vehicles will add  
immensely to the efficiency of our road systems' carrying capacity. 

........I have been riding my 6 year old trike based Velomobile during the  winter on a almost daily bases and recently got back on a low front wheel drive bike when the weather got warmer. The seat is 7 inches off the ground (so is the trike seat). This 15 year old bike has been one of my favorites because of its aerodynamics but also of its quick but precise handling. It feels like its an extension of my body. 

But after riding a trike for 6 months getting back on this bike I couldn't keep a straight line - I kept wiggling. It took more than an hour before I began to get that comfortable feeling again and could hold a straight line. 
I have realized that it took energy to balance a bike but hadn't realized how much until this recent trike to bike experience.  

When I first built my trike I began to noticed how relaxing it was to run errands around town and not having to get the feet down at intersections. There was no tension when stopping or when starting at low speeds. No balance requirement. I could spend more of my efforts on sizing up the traffic situations at the intersections. 
I could also relax in mall parking lots and if a car was backing out of a parking place simply jam on the brakes.  

And during the winter there was always that fear of going down from black ice at night when on a bike/streamliner  (which happened a few times) which is gone on a trike. 

If you want to hot rod around a bike is much more fun than a trike. But for alternate transportation the trike layout shines.
