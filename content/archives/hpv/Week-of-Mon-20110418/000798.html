I test rode a trike at 'Bent Up in his mostly quiet N. Hollywood  
neighborhood.  I couldn't even enter the road from his back alley  
without feeling completely blind trying to see around parked cars.   I  
know any lowish recumbent is going to have this issue to some extent,  
but it just felt like much more of an issue than on my bike with maybe  
a 23&quot; high seat.

That said, I think a trike would work on most of the loops I ride in  
San Francisco. They are mostly parks and roads with bike lanes.
