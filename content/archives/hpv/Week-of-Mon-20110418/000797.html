Lray is now in Colorado. I think the size and rarity of the trikes  
gives them a &quot;what the heck is that?&quot; advantage. When they are fully  
faired the effect is even greater. My modified F-40 has the same  
effect, even amongst the the thousands of regular cyclists that  
partook of Los Angeles CycLAvia two weeks ago. That was the event   
which closed off 7.5 miles( 12km) of downtown city streets on a Sunday  
so that anyone on any form of no- motorized vehicle could 'take the  
road' for five hours or so. This was the second such event here, model  
on the weekly event held in Bogota, Columbia. It is becoming popular  
and the mayor wants to do it monthly eventually. Las Vegas should  
consider it too. Happy Earth Day Everyone!
