 From the video they seem to have added a small wheel of the same size  
rotating in the opposite direction atop each of the ground connected  
wheels to try and cancel out local gyro forces. I don't think they  
succeeded as much as they might have wished, as the rim velocity would  
be the same as a large wheel. Only the mass would be much reduced.  
They state that they used in effect a reversed caster on the front but  
they would still have perhaps enough residual gyro forces once things  
got moving to hold the line of travel within the narrow self  
correcting range of the entire system including the inertia of their  
handlebars.

On a somewhat related thought experiment I wrote to an Automotive  
writer for the LA Times after she, a very skilled high speed  
motorcyclist, had written of her inability to keep upright when she  
tried the X-prize winning X-tracer electric Cabin Motorcycle based on  
the Swiss BMW powered  Monotracer.  That machine has a recumbent  
riding position, and starts out steering like a car before retracting  
its 'landing gear' near 18mph  and suddenly behaving like a bike. A  
rather steep learning curve. . One of the engineers who did the  
electric conversion told me I might be one of the few he knew who  
might be able to just get on and ride, but I rather doubt that. In  
addition to its much greater mass than the 'crotch rockets' she was  
used to, it had an empty seat  and the mass of the motor and battery  
pack behind her to try and instantly cope with. I told her about the  
sort of balancing methods we recumbent riders use, and she thanked me  
for my input, but was not at all anxious to try it again.

  I believe this exercise in understanding two wheeled stability may  
have been in search of the self balancing algorythm we will need to  
get two wheeled vehicles to the state of 'ease of use' that the  
general public will need in the future. Such vehicles will add  
immensely to the efficiency of our road systems' carrying capacity.  
The engineer I mentioned has said that the miles per kwh of the X- 
tracer is well more than double that of the Nissan Leaf. The EPA  
computation of eMpg that is used on the window stickers for the Volt  
and the Leaf is based on calculations for four wheeled vehicles that  
most often contain just one person.  What the X-tracer needs more than  
anything else to be anything more than a rich persons plaything(It  
will cruise at top autobahn speeds with ease and air-conditioned  
comfort, but with costs commensurate) is an automated balancing system  
and an easier ingress. Fully  faired HPV's could become more common  
place with those improvements as well[mandatory HPV content].
