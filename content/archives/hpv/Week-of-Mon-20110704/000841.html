<PRE>&gt;<i>People always start slowly backing away from me when I start talking 
</I>&gt;<i>like this ... but...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I recall a planetary BB gear system that gave you one gear when 
</I>&gt;<i>pedaling forward, and another when pedaling backward.  I believe 
</I>&gt;<i>there is a chain loop system that does the same thing. I don't care 
</I>&gt;<i>so much about the gear change, but it always seemed to me that being 
</I>&gt;<i>able to change the way one is using ones legs might provide some 
</I>&gt;<i>welcome variety on long rides.  On a conventional bike you can move 
</I>&gt;<i>about a lot more, including standing on the pedals.  Not so much on 
</I>&gt;<i>a 'bent.
</I>
The chain loop system goes back well over 100 years and is called 
Retro-Direct  5-6 years ago there was a micro-mini-revival of the 
idea among tinkerers. 4 local guys built such systems but the only 
one who has stuck with it is Dave Krafft and his was the only 
recumbent.  As far as I know he's still using it regularly.

You can see his bike at 
<A HREF="http://mnhpva.org/Meetings/2006/feb_06/pages/03.html">http://mnhpva.org/Meetings/2006/feb_06/pages/03.html</A> and on the next 
4 pages.

A few years ago someone finished PBP on a vintage Retro-Direct.

I would have thought 2 speeds inadequate for all but the fittest 
riders but now I'm getting around just fine using my Sturmey S2.
