Atoc's new website is now live! Go take a look! www.atoc.com

I'm sure we'll be finding little details to fix for a quite a while, and we 
need to upgrade some of the photos, but the information is all there. Feel 
free to send feedback to either charlie at atoc.com or tom.killion at atoc.com.

Have a happy and safe 4th of July weekend. Perhaps I'll see you at the 
NorthWest Tandem Rally.

Good morning,
I saw this on a blog this morning.
http://theaccidentalhermit.blogspot.com/2009/07/old-school-velomobile.html

Article links to plans for sale for a WWII era Swedish velomobile design
that was apparently built in fairly large numbers.

Also mentions a book, but I didn't see how to get it.

It was published as a building instruction (not very detailed). A few  
years a book was published about 'cykelbilar' in Sweden. I have the  
book, but it is not being printed anymore.
