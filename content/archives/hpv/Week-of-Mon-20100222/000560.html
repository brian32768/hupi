Nice concept, since I know bike specific freeways are not on the horizon using alt streets has been a good strategy for bike commuters even here in Phoenix, a sorry place for riding vs anywhere in the Pacific NW. 

 

What's missing is why to use them, the people that created them here didn't think it through and that's why they leave you with big gaps in transportation routes getting anywhere you need to go.

 

So, alt streets need to be a part of a master plan to move people on hpvs to get them somewhere, here they put them in but seems never seriously considered bikes as transportation so nothing goes anywhere, and, since this place was created by land developers, it's not exactly easy in a car to get anywhere either ... lol!!
