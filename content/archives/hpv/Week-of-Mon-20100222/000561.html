I think what Portland is exploiting is a pre-war street grid.  In  
typical pre-war street grids, the side streets went through.

Post war development has favored super grids. Side streets do not go  
through. It is cul-de-sac land.

Obviously most N Am cities have some areas that are pre-war, but  
sometimes more recent development, especially freeways, has broken up  
the grid.  Several of the streets I've tried to ride in downtown Miami  
have freeway on and off ramps that require me to deal with some fast  
merging cars.
