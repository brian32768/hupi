I also think that this is a bit black &amp; white, though I take your  
point.  Many of my neighbors and colleagues here in SW Germany never,  
and I mean never, take a bike for anything, and many here also view  
bikes as toys, as fun, as sport.  I grew up in Sacramento, CA, which  
has had a pretty nice recreational trail network for years, and quite  
a few large streets with good bike lanes.
