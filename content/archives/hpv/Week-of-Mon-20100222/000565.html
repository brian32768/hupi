<PRE>If the customer has a Jeep, I'd recommend a hitch mounted rack. The J&amp;B 
Sun/Hollywood recumbent hitch rack is reasonably priced and works well. I 
use it with all kinds of recumbents, including several kinds of SWBs, LWBs, 
lowracers, and a SpeedMachine. It's fit them all. It's rather heavy, but 
it's sturdy. It sticks out far enough on my RAV4 to clear the spare tire on 
the back.

I have no experience with spare tire mounted racks, but the few I've seen 
haven't been very serious racks. If the Streetmachine is USS, it will be 
hard to carry it on most racks without wheel trays. Wheel tray racks work 
really well with recumbents. I think Charlie from ATOC is on this list; he 
can tell you how his racks work with SpeedMachines and Jeeps with spare 
tires on the back. I'd be shocked if he didn't have a nice solution.
