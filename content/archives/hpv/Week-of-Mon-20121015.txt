The drift issue is about imperfections in the construction of the vehicle
and side winds blowing on it. Even assuming that the design of their
helicopter is perfectly balanced in theory, the reality is the balance of
the actual vehicle will never be truly perfect. If there is even a teensy
mismatch between the center of gravity and center of lift of the helicopter,
or a teensy side wind due to the building's ventilation system or eddies
from the rotor down draft, the result will be that the helicopter drifts to
the side. 

BTW, there is no "if" the main arms or any other frame pieces will sag, i.e.
flex. They will. The question is how much they flex and how to allow or
compensate for this in the design. That's structural mechanics and
aeroelasticity.

These students have done impressive work. I hope they grab the Sikorsky
Prize, but even if they don't they've shown that it is within reach. Igor
would be proud!
