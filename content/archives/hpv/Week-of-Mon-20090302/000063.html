I do, but have reservations on posting them, on the grounds that Children 
might be Reading.

Mike Burrows has become, in his dotage, a great proponent of short cranks. 
They allow one to spin faster, save one's knees and raise and lower Tower 
Bridge from the comfort of one's own bed.  Which is all very well, but since 
I can happily turn over 172.5 mm cranks at 120 rpm all day if necessary, I 
have difficulty in seeing how sawing off a third of the length of the crank 
is going to make any difference.

Moreover, with one set of 165s, one of 172.5s and five 170s, switching to 
short cranks across the fleet is going to cost Money, the more so when one 
considers that one will need to faff about with the gearing as well.  The 
Bank of England may have just invented a shedload more of it, but they do 
not seem keen to give any of it to me, the worthless gits.

Among the calamities of war may be jointly numbered the diminution of the 
love of truth, by the falsehoods which interest dictates and credulity 
encourages.
