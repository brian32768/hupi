<PRE>Hi JOHN,

&gt;<i> Thank you for posting you tests on short cranks. I have been running 
</I>&gt;<i> 155s for many years.
</I>
It's a pleasure! Sadly before I could do more comprehensive measurements the 
power meter started playing up and I ended up with a long back and forth saga 
trying to get it replaced without any luck. It was an early Ergomo that measured 
the twist in the crank axle via two notched disks, one at each end of the axle. 
The phase difference between the two was used as a measure of torque and thence 
to power. They had a lot of trouble with manufacturing quality and I had it 
replaced once before the company was brought out. The new guys refused to take 
on the old failures... :-(

I think the cranks are a lot to do with personal preference but I do like them 
and have found going back to long cranks from time-to-time very strange. There 
is probably enough of interest going on in using short cranks to try and devise 
some more objective way of measuring. The great difficulty is that the effect of 
training - or being used to / not used to - any particular length moves the 
baseline and any effect is likely to be small rather than obviously large. Still 
the anecdotal evidence of increased comfort makes them worth a look for anyone 
experiencing pain or discomfort.

Cheerio
Rodger

</PRE>
