<PRE>Readers of Recumbent Cyclist News may remember Thad Sitton's article on 
short cranks (by which he meant crankset arms shorter than standard, not 
grumpy people who aren't tall).  After a short hiatus he has drunk the 
short crank kool-aid again.  He was back in the shop the other day with 
a newly charged campaign, complete with slogan: &quot;Ninety degrees empowers 
your knees.&quot;

His view is that crank arm length should be selected so that the 
pedaling stroke does not require one to bend the knee past 90 degrees. 
I've seen some crank length calculators here and there, but this method 
goes more by testing and direct observation than by a biometrics formula.

He thinks that cranks are sized well for upright bikes, and observed 
that riders of such bikes don't bend their knees past 90 degrees, but 
this isn't the case when putting the same cranks on 'bents.  This makes 
sense to me, since a 'bent rider's hips are more immobilized by the 
seat, meaning the legs must flex more, whereas a roadie who is pinions 
on that little seat can bring their hips into action.

Thad had been using 153mm cranks supplied by Bikesmith Designs on his 
SWB bikes, but stopped using them after getting into trikes.  When he 
recently began experimenting again, his observation was that the short 
cranks (153mm in this case) do not feel especially &quot;right.&quot;  What he 
noticed was that switching /back/ to the 165mm cranks on his other trike 
felt distinctly &quot;wrong.&quot;  In fact, he is no longer satisfied with 153mm 
(it doesn't quite pass his 90 degree test) and has set Bikesmith's Mark 
Stonich to murdering another Truvativ Blaze crankset.

Does anyone else on the list have some thoughts on this matter?

Thad wants me to and my employees to try this test ourselves.  I have a 
155mm crank that I've been meaning to put on my BikeE, and I will when 
it comes in for its long overdue tuneup and cogset replacement.  My wife 
has been using a 155 set for a while and likes it, but it seems the real 
qualitative difference is noticed when experimentally switching /back/ 
to long cranks, which she hasn't done.  I'll be doing some tests on one 
of my employees once he finishes his double century this weekend to see 
what length will get him down to a 90 degree bend.  In the long run 
we'll likely do some power meter tests once I get my Ergomo fixed and we 
can do some more quantitative comparisons.

Does anyone know of power meter tests done on 'bents with varying crank 
lengths?
