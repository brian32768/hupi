 From what I've seen I don't think the web forum will be much 
competition.  It doesn't work very well, but I suppose that is to be 
expected with a newly established forum.

I registered, but I'm unable to edit my profile.  I've repeatedly had to 
put in my password, but whenever I try to submit changes to my profile 
I'm told that I must * give an email address, * give a valid email 
address, and that  * the email address I've given is already in use, so 
use another.

And despite all that email hassle, there doesn't seem to be a way to 
interact with the forum via email, which is the only way I'd reliably 
follow it.

So at this stage of the game I'd say &quot;don't bother.&quot;

Topping it off, there seems to be no way of removing one's own 
membership account.
