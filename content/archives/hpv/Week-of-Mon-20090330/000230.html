Sticking with the topic at hand, here's a YouTube video from a gentleman
who has been exploring Phantom Trailers since 1985.
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-DwQ5AAO9o&amp;NR=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-DwQ5AAO9o&amp;NR=1</A>

Given this one specific task to bring home the oak wood, may I suggest
using human power only, but calling on some concepts from regen braking,
power assist, and the elegance of walking?  (Dang, Theo that sounds like
a fun problem to tackle.)

At zero speed there is zero watt needed for braking. There is also zero
watt of mechanical braking power when a wheeled vehicle is allowed to
accelerate to terminal velocity. In between these two speed extremes
there exists another specific speed which results in maximum braking
power. When plotting this concept out as speed by power, accounting for
slope, mass and other drag,  a bell-like curve appears. The peak of the
curve is that point where a heavily-ladened tandem's tires can explode
from rim-heating or a regen system would be producing its maximum output.

The actual values are not so important right now only the recognition
that at descent rates slightly greater than  0 m/s  and slightly less
than terminal velocity require minimal amounts of braking power in order
to sustain a constant rate of descent. Motion occurs when braking power
against gravity on a slope becomes greater than 0 watt, even by a few
&quot;drops&quot;.

To apply this observation in practice, means going down a steep slope
with a  &gt;100 kg cargo at the low end of the speed range, as near to
walking speed as possible, e.g., on the order of 1 m/s or even less. By
&quot;steep&quot;, I tend to visualize slopes between 8% and 15%.

If one's descent speed seems to be increasing (a cycle computer might
not be of much help to monitor a crawling rate) the rider, pulls on the
brakes, or drags a foot, long before a run away could occur -- and
always keeping one eye alert for places and features on the side of the
road to intensionally run into in order to stop. Using lowest possible
braking power means the bike's brakes alone can be fully sufficient.

The super slow approach can also be applied to a hand cart without
mechanical brakes. It's a technique I use when doing
legend-in-my-own-mind Manly Man trailering chores. &lt;smile&gt;  If a person
want to try the technique, it's like a good idea to practice with modest
loads in the beginning.

Cheers,

John Snyder
