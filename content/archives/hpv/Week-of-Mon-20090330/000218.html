The points are not only 56k Modems but general resource efficiency, usefulness, 
archiving and searchability.

General resource efficiency:
Mailing lists live on servers, are stored by members, cached by all sorts of 
machines, and transferred all over the place. This adds up to a lot of resources 
used even if videos use a lot more. On a personal level, 20k messages instead of 
2k messages use up disc space ten times quicker, and discs are often nearly 
full, no matter how big. The general problem is like with a lot of things, that 
those people using the resources heavily aren't those who have to pay for them. 
(see <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons</A> )

Usefulness:
Not removing quotes greating reduces readability on mailing lists, especially if 
subscribed in the digest mode.

Archiving and searchability:
These messages are archived at lots of places such as 
<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hupi.org">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hupi.org</A> but also privately. If you have 
to wade through lots of repetitions to find something, you are less likely to 
find what you want. Even powerful search engines won't help when the same 
messages are repeated many times.

For all these reasons, Netiquette is these days *more* and not *less* important 
than in the early internet days. For just chatting, other media than mailing 
lists are more appropriate. Or, at least set up the mailing list to be private, 
i.e. only visible to members. But I guess this is not what most of us here want.

Best, Theo Schmidt
