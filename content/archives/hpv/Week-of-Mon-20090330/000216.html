<PRE>Theo,

This first bit is in response to the notion of using a hub motor as a 
clutch, when without an electric load.

Svend Nielsen of Sweden created a website at 
<A HREF="http://www.svendus.se/goldenmotor/index.html">http://www.svendus.se/goldenmotor/index.html</A>  His page shows still 
photos of a two-wheel trailer with the left wheel equipped an electric 
hub motor. The right wheel has a standard hub which can be seen in the  
YouTube video; <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooTwoJeEVxE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooTwoJeEVxE</A>  A flat topped 
cargo-box such as on Svend's pusher trailer looks a natural place to 
incorporate a solar panel.    It might be a pricey experiment using a 
similar trailer to compare using one hub motor to using two hub motors 
for the purpose of regenerative braking. One motor might work for some 
regen ability, even when asymetric, or not...
 
The Aevon is a single wheeled bike trailer, bigger than a BOB. If I 
recall correctly, the website hinted that it is possible to use a hub 
motor wheel to create a pusher trailer. &quot;IIRC&quot; because the URL was 
active earlier today, but not active at this moment; 
<A HREF="http://www.aevon.eu/pages/aevon_bicycle_trailers_english.html">http://www.aevon.eu/pages/aevon_bicycle_trailers_english.html</A>


 &gt; I have been chewing on this problem for 24 years now. You really need a
 &gt; freewheel which can be locked for braking. I did indeed buy one which 
was made
 &gt; for fixed-wheel bicycles, i.e. to have the option of fixed wheel or 
freewheel,
 &gt; but I never actually used it.

Yours is likely the solution of brilliance, e.g., least complex and most 
functional. One might start with the single-speed coaster brake hub, put 
it on a single-wheel trailer which also carries cargo, then make a chain 
connection back to the motor/generator. A simple approach could be to 
start with an Adams Trail-A-Bike, or similar, then modify after  
removing the saddle, handlebars and drive train .  
<A HREF="http://www.trail-a-bike.com/product/">http://www.trail-a-bike.com/product/</A>   Used for its intended purpose, 
the Trail-A-Bike might be recognized as being an occasional low-power 
assist.

I wonder though, with a pusher trailer used for regen if there would 
there be an effective minimum weight requirement?  Too light, implies 
the trailer's wheel or wheels would skid across the pavement instead of 
rotate when braking.

Cheers,

John Snyder
