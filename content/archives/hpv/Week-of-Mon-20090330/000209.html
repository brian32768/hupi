This seems to me to be exactly what Al suggested, John. I guess this is the way 
to go if you can do without electric braking.


&gt;<i> YouTube has several video clips of people who have built single-wheel

We still have this problem: if you do require regernerative or at least 
electrical resistive braking, you cannot use a freewheel. If you don't use a 
freewheel (or one-way clutch), the motor has to turn all the time. This doesn't 
matter so much if:

1) the vehicle is mainly a motor vehicle, like the Twike, or

2) the motor is direct and brushless, like some hub motors (Bionx?), so that 
there is little appreciable resistance from the motor when it is not connected 
electrically but still being turned.

I have been chewing on this problem for 24 years now. You really need a 
freewheel which can be locked for braking. I did indeed buy one which was made 
for fixed-wheel bicycles, i.e. to have the option of fixed wheel or freewheel, 
but I never actually used it.

Cheers, Theo Schmidt
