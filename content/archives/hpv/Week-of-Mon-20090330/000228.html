<PRE>Slap on a couple of beefy BMX brakes on the trailer, set up the cable so
that it can be removed (tandem cables may be long enough), find a brake
handle where the clamp opens up to make it easy on/off.

The worry is cable stretch, to be practical for really heavy loads it may
take using hydraulics to get the pull back to where it's split by cables to
the two sides. Still worth the trouble but the brake handle with an opening
clamp may be harder to find.

hth,

Tom Mallard

John and all,

Thanks for all the inputs and links WRT trailers. I didn't know so much was 
going on.
..
&gt;<i> I wonder though, with a pusher trailer used for regen if there would 
</I>&gt;<i> there be an effective minimum weight requirement?  Too light, implies 
</I>&gt;<i> the trailer's wheel or wheels would skid across the pavement instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> rotate when braking.
</I>
In the phantom-trailer concept it just has to brake its own weight, not that
of 
the steering vehicle. I'm more worried about the heavily-laden end, in fact
I 
would have an application right now: a neighbour uphill from me has some oak

wood for me, very heavy. No way I can use my trailer downhill with my bike,
it's 
just too steep laden with 100 kg or so; I can only just manage on foot and
it's 
dicey. If it had an effective brake (evenly on both wheels) - whether
mechanical 
or electric, I could use the bike. Hmm, maybe a Segway could be turned into
a 
phantom trailer...

Cheers, Theo
