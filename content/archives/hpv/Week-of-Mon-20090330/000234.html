</I>
I have a newly built heavy duty trailer with inertia brakes on it.
It's not rocket science... well, except the &quot;don't use cheap caliper
brakes&quot; part. But since it's four wheeled I am not particularly
concerned about balancing the brakes, so I have not bothered at all.
Conceptually it's fairly easy to do that though, it just adds
slightly to the mechanical complexity.

I've taken photos, I just don't have a web page for it yet.

The idea is that the trailer hitch telescopes, and as it compresses
that movement tensions two brake cables that run to brakes on the
trailer. The minor complication is turning that compression into
tension, which means running a post along the hitch from one part to
hold the cables.

In side view mine looks like this:


                 bar /------------------(2)
--------------------------    // (1)
&lt;- to trailer        ==========================&gt; bike
--------------------------

(1) cable outer ends attach to bike part here, run left to brakes on
trailer
(2) ends of brake cables attach to trailer here.

In plan view the bar is a T, for me that's welded solid but you could
get some brake balancing by making that pivot.

Much better braking can be got using cable operated disk brakes, but
that adds $400 to the $200 trailer... I'll do that if I really need
to, but right now I'm in the process of attaching V brakes instead of
caliper ones (the ones that came with the 16&quot; front forks I'm using)
