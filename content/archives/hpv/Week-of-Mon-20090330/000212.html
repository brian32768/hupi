&gt;<i>Ah, yes, but where do we find human-range gearboxes and clutches?
</I>.........Making a suitable coupling device/transmission  is part of the challenge. 

&gt;<i>Any actual experiments and results you can point us to?
</I>......Not really. At that time there was so little concern for conservation of energy. 

There was a person by the name of Peter Sharp back in the early 1990s who was a kind of leader on the subject. He wrote about the merits of such systems and tried to get people interested,  to no avail

He even proposed detailed rules for IHPVA races that could include human power derived energy accumulators. 
But the racers wanted nothing to do with this. 

Had there had been an interest back then by now we probably would have some results to show and talk about. 

My last known address of Peter Sharp is 2786 Bellaire Place, Oakland Ca, 94601.
