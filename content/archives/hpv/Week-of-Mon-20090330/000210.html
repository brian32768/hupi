As an owner of an e-assist velomobile, with the motor driving the cranks, I
can say that it is probably the best method to get either top performance or
top economy from an electric motor on a bike.  My velomobile was (and is,
with the new owner) equipped with a Stokemonkey system. It drives the left
side (via a tandem crank) of the bottom bracket with a freewheel on the
motor. When the motor runs, the operator must pedal, but the operator may
pedal and the motor freewheels.  Some people dislike the idea, but it worked
great for me and allows for continual human assist. Clipless pedals are a
must, for safety reasons.

Cyclone systems are similar, but drive the right side and have a no-pedal
freewheel for those inclined to let the motor do the work.

Electric motors are most efficient in a narrow rpm range and most powerful
in a slightly lower, but no less narrow rpm range. By running through the
cranks, you can select the best rpm for either your climbs or duration
requirements. I picked the left side gearing ratio to give me the best
efficiency rpm at my mid-range to high-range cadence, and it fell into place
that best power dropped into the same range as my climb cadence.

Some e-bike operators will post figures of 10-15 watt hours per mile, but
one would suggest that means not quite as much pedaling as the Stokemonkey
system. I never saw double digit figures and managed to bring in five to
seven watt hours per mile in my velomobile. Aerodynamics played a big part
in the low figures, of course.

The Stokemonkey has incredible torque and will buckle frame tubes if not
well braced. Todd from clevercycles.com may not want to sell a system, for
other than the Xtracycle for which it is designed, as my velomobile was an
experiment that went quite well.  It's also pricey, but on a par with the
BionX in my opinion.

If you have pieces and parts from another system and can engineer a
Stokemonkey or Cyclone system into your bike, you'll find it rewarding in
all ways.  You'll likely be able to bias the weight forward on the slippery
front wheel, but put the traction to the rear where you need it.

I'm not against hub motors, but I believe that a crank-based system has so
much more going for it.

Keep us updated on your project and progress.

Subject: [hpv] LWB and batteries

Since I have been diagnosed with tachycardia (occasional bursts of high
heart rate) I am on beta blockers and can no longer climb the steep hills in
Seattle  (BTW I highly recommend riding with a heart rate monitor.  That's
the way I discovered my tachycardia).  I have been thinking about where to
put an electrical assist on my bike.  I am 6 ft 3 in with big feet, so I
prefer LWB bikes in order to avoid heel interference problems that I have
encountered on SWBs.  So I ride an old Infinity USS LWB (Avatar type).

Where to put the electrical assist, such as a BionX.  I could put it on the
20 in front wheel, with the battery pack up front.  This might help with the
main drawback of LWBs:  the poor weight distribution and the lightly loaded
front wheel, which breaks free so easily.  But would I have enough traction
up there to prevent slipping on a wet uphill climb (when I need it most)?

Alternatively I was thinking of building a USS LWB frame around a pedelec
unit salvaged from a Giant LaFree Lite up front assisting my pedaling at the
crank.  I would also mount the battery up front to help with the
aforementioned weight distribution problem.  Comments?

Gee, we've been getting into the &quot;power assist&quot; lately, haven't we. I'll add
to the pile:

The Portland Human Power Challenge (May 23-25) will feature the second
annual ePower Challenge on Monday, May 25th for human-electric hybrids.
Here's the info about the event: <A HREF="http://www.ohpv.org/HPC/ePowerEvents.html">http://www.ohpv.org/HPC/ePowerEvents.html</A>

....several years ago before the sensitivity to energy consumption was in

Hello Fred;

You should post your comments on your system on  the ULEA Ultra Light
Electric Assist site.

....They need a current limiter. Without it the battery the gear box, and
motor are excessively stressed. 
With the current limiter they could use a lighter gear box, maybe a lighter
motor, and even a smaller battery.

This seems to me to be exactly what Al suggested, John. I guess this is the
way 
to go if you can do without electric braking.


&gt;<i> YouTube has several video clips of people who have built single-wheel 
</I>&gt;<i> power assist trailers, which simplifies matters. 
</I>
We still have this problem: if you do require regernerative or at least 
electrical resistive braking, you cannot use a freewheel. If you don't use a

freewheel (or one-way clutch), the motor has to turn all the time. This
doesn't 
matter so much if:

1) the vehicle is mainly a motor vehicle, like the Twike, or

2) the motor is direct and brushless, like some hub motors (Bionx?), so that

there is little appreciable resistance from the motor when it is not
connected 
electrically but still being turned.

I have been chewing on this problem for 24 years now. You really need a 
freewheel which can be locked for braking. I did indeed buy one which was
made 
for fixed-wheel bicycles, i.e. to have the option of fixed wheel or
freewheel, 
but I never actually used it.

Cheers, Theo Schmidt
