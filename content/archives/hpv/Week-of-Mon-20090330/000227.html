<PRE>John and all,

Thanks for all the inputs and links WRT trailers. I didn't know so much was 
going on.
...
&gt;<i> I wonder though, with a pusher trailer used for regen if there would 
</I>&gt;<i> there be an effective minimum weight requirement?  Too light, implies 
</I>&gt;<i> the trailer's wheel or wheels would skid across the pavement instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> rotate when braking.
</I>
In the phantom-trailer concept it just has to brake its own weight, not that of 
the steering vehicle. I'm more worried about the heavily-laden end, in fact I 
would have an application right now: a neighbour uphill from me has some oak 
wood for me, very heavy. No way I can use my trailer downhill with my bike, it's 
just too steep laden with 100 kg or so; I can only just manage on foot and it's 
dicey. If it had an effective brake (evenly on both wheels) - whether mechanical 
or electric, I could use the bike. Hmm, maybe a Segway could be turned into a 
phantom trailer...

Cheers, Theo
</PRE>
