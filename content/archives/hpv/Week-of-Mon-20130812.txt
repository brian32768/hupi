Subject: [hpv] Steering head bearing loads in front-drive bike
Message-ID: <5208F75B.6020701@cs.cmu.edu>

I'm working on a front-drive bike, similar to Tom Traylor's design 
(http://traylor_fwd.home.mindspring.com/) or Cruzbike 
(http://cruzbike.com/). I was considering the loads on the headset 
bearings, since the pedaling loads will be transmitted to the front fork 
assembly through these, along with the usual load from the weight on the 
fork. With strong pedaling thrust (I assumed 200# to be possible), I 
estimate the side load on the lower headset bearing to be around 
400#-500#, depending on the headset bearing separation. This seems like 
a lot for typical steering bearings, certainly more than would be 
encountered in a conventional diamond-frame bike. Has anyone else 
considered or had experience with this?

I'm attaching a copy of my analysis, in case anyone is interested in the 
details.

	Thanks, Ben

One of the things I've pondered over the years is, "Why do we use ball or roller bearings in head sets?"  Nothing is rotating more than a couple degrees ( more than 90% of the time) plus or minus, and a good shock through the wheel into the fork can cause indentation of the balls into the races.  Use a bushing and you spread forces over infinitely larger bearing surfaces than the contact area of balls/races.  In the case of MBB FWD, bushings have the added advantage of extra drag dampening some pedal induced oscillation.

Why not bushings? "Stiction" (STarting frICTION) 

The tiny, subconscious corrections you are always making to balance a bike require little or no friction at the start. With a bushing the force needed to initiate the movement would initially be high then suddenly drop off.  

My Raleigh Twenty folder has a bushing replacing the top bearing, with a conventional lower headset bearing.  With a steep head angle and a steerer almost as long as the blades, this is as favorable an application for a bushing as you are likely to find.  I find it "tolerable" but many who use their Twenties more than I do have converted with an Aheadset type upper bearing. 

OTOH the Greenspeed trikes get by with bushings as they don't have to be balanced.

Bushings are great once stiction is overcome, and motion is in progress, but ball or roller bearings are much better at the very start when the motions are reciprocating back and forth as in steering. I note that my very precise German equatorial telescope mount uses huge roller bearings just for a 40 lb. telescope. Its subtle reversals while hunting stars at very tiny angles are probably due to its very low loading and smooth roller bearing.
 Both in railroad applications and others, it is the low starting torgue at high load that is a part of the reason for the common use of such bearings today. As for  Tom Traylor's and the Cruzbike designs I suspect the starting torque is quite limited  to what can be withstood by the arms holding the handlebars as straight as is needed for good balance. Tom has told me he can ride no hands, using differential steering, but I had to back off quite substantially when I tried pushing off on one of his bikes. Normal headsets used in mountain bikes probably see greater stress from rocky downhills than any good rider is likely to impose

I've talked with reps from IGUS about using sleeve bearings for headsets and they seem they may work for the job, self-lubricating and with a slight break-in they should be loose enough to ride no hands, he was somewhat a rider so knew what I was talking about enough to feel if I had a shop to make custom races would do it, stiction seemed it wouldn't be an issue to him & I was referencing Campy, to me there is mass contact area if truly stiction is minimal, my project a tt frame and trying to use 1" for the headtube; here's a mt. bike using them: http://www.igus.com/wpck/default.aspx?pagenr=8238&C=US&L=en

I tried bushings on my early Tadpole Velomobile trike but found the 
stiction, as small as it seemed, it prevented mico adjustments in the 
steering.
So I put in a thrust bearing in the top of the head tube. The steering 
became beautifully smooth

Garrie, one of the things that make a bicycle rideable is the near-zero friction in the headset. This allows tiny, subtle movements to happen, which in turn allows the bicycle to balance with tiny corrections to the steering. A bike with a "tight" headset is a chore to ride, and it certainly won't self-correct when "ghost ridden".

Even the largest motorcycles use roller or ball bearings in their steering pivots instead of bushings.

Thanks for all the responses regarding the importance of minimizing 
friction in the headset bearings. I agree.

I'll take Paul's advice and forge ahead on the assumption that standard 
bearings will be adequate for the Traylor-type front-drive bike.

	Thanks, Ben

For a try at using a 1" headtube I like John's post of mixing a bushing at the crown end and thrust or tapered bearings on top, that makes sense to me.
 
It seemed to imply that the bushing doesn't affect stiction by having a static load all the time, but for free motion you need tapers or balls on top where there isn't enough load so stiction becomes too high on an upper bushing.
