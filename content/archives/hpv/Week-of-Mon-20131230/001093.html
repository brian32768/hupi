<PRE>I see no reason not to encourage  the development of a performance delta.
  A low delta certainly has adequate stability  for any situations arising  in
road use
or HPV competitions.
This past year we produced 3 more Barracuda shells. Two are being completed
by other builders in the tadpole design.
   The third remains at my shop. I am currently doing drawings to render it as a
delta.
A single enclosed wheel up front   presents a lower frontal area than
any tadpole velomobile.The 4 inch ground clearence of the original Cuda will be
maintained
and provide more than adequate stabilty.
     I note that  Warren's  original Cuda is very narrow . The second Cuda that
I completed
was widened by Jeff Wills  for fit.
   Following  his lead ,  we made a second wider Cuda mold  this past summer.
Because of Warren's  height and the wider mold the result is a shell that will
fit a
large rider.
    As I would require a crane to enter and exit a  vehicle 4 inches off the
ground
I am seeking  an interested  younger rider to move this project ahead.
   At this point the positions and number of wheels is  optional.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Ever watch one of us geezers trying to get up off of a low tadpole?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hilarious!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gee I easily qualify as an old geezer, but I have no problem getting up off
</I>&gt;<i> a seat that is 7 inches off the ground. But then I have a above seat
</I>&gt;<i> handlebar system on my tadpole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back 9 years ago I wrote up my trike design philosophy, which started with
</I>&gt;<i> the issues of getting in/out of a shelled vehicle. It all centered around
</I>&gt;<i> the above seat T shaped handlebar system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To get up off a low seat I grab a brake so the vehicle wont move, grab the
</I>&gt;<i> center of the handlebar and pull myself up, and step out of the vehicle.
</I>&gt;<i> Easily - no struggle.
</I>&gt;<i> I also use the same system to lower myself with ease down on the seat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also use the handlebar to push and steer the vehicle as I walk along side
</I>&gt;<i> it to move it from one place to another. I do this a lot when shopping and
</I>&gt;<i> running errands and parking the vehicle at home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also grab the handlebar for stability as I get in/out of my  vehicle.
</I>&gt;<i> Because I don't need to put any of my weight on the shell it allows the use
</I>&gt;<i> of very light shell materials.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also grab the handlebar and back of the seat to lift the vehicle. It helps
</I>&gt;<i> that it only weighs 45 pounds (that's trike with shell - shell is around 7
</I>&gt;<i> pounds).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I have run without the shell my trike out coasts other trikes because
</I>&gt;<i> they have side stick steering (more frontal area - my arms are more in line
</I>&gt;<i> with the airflow).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This handlebar allow smaller lighter canopies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yet to my amazement, in all these years essentially no one is using above
</I>&gt;<i> seat handlebars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently did a write up on details of this system. I call it
</I>&gt;<i> T Bar. T for its shape and T because that's the letter of my last name.
