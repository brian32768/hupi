I recently picked up a used Challenge Hurricane to replace my 20 year old Infinity (80K+ miles, pretty much falling apart, ovalized headtube, etc).  I have mounted a Windwrap fairing and have a Novosport tailbox on order.

I want to make a body stocking for this bike, mainly to protect me from the weather.  I have some nice flexible fabric that windsurfers use, sort of like Darlexx.  I would like to attach it somehow to the trailing edge of the fairing and to the front of the tailbox, so that I can remove it easily and equipped with removable side panels/zipper door.  

Any suggestions for attaching the fabric to the plastic fairing and tailbox?  I have thought of Velcro adhesive strips, but that doesn't sound very durable.  Or hooks or a zipper strip.  

Also, I would like to have a window on the top so that I can see a computer and HRM.  Anyone have experience with mounting/sewing flexible transparent plastic?

Hook & loop fasteners will work fine, especially since your fairing will 
not be turning with the steering.

The other alternative I have used is to sew a shock cord into the edge 
of the fabric, and have hooks the cord can be pulled over.

Velcro is commonly used to attach body socks to Zzipper and Windwrap fairings. They're quite common here in Portland, and there's a couple seamstresses that make them. They're pretty booked on the "project" front, but a note on the OHPV forum might get you in line.

IIRC, there's a couple tricks: The "hook" side attaches to the fairing- get industrial strength Velcro since the common stuff is kind of weak. The "loop" side needs to be elastic since it gets sewn to the fabric. Also, the sock is attached on the outside of the fairing so fabric tension holds everything together. If it's on the inside, it'll pull apart.

A couple folks have windows sewn into the tops of the socks so they can see their computers- I can't comment on how this is done. I think the windows are sewn into non-stretchy fabric, which is then sewn into the top of the sock.

'Round here, they come in every color of the rainbow!

    Polycarbide from a boat canvas shop is frequently sewn to canvas with an
industrial sewing machine.
    Alternatively you could awl the holes in the poly first and hand sew it
to the fabric.

Stuart,
I have a Velokit which is constructed much like your project. The
Velcro eventually wears but it lasts a long time. I found that Goop is
a good glue for attaching velco to most surfaces including seat mesh.

The builder of Velokits told me he glues the plastic windows to the
fabric with silicon then sews them.

Thanks all for great advice!  I will pursue some of these materials and let you all know how it goes.
