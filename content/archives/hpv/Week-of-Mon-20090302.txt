 From what I've seen I don't think the web forum will be much 
competition.  It doesn't work very well, but I suppose that is to be 
expected with a newly established forum.

I registered, but I'm unable to edit my profile.  I've repeatedly had to 
put in my password, but whenever I try to submit changes to my profile 
I'm told that I must * give an email address, * give a valid email 
address, and that  * the email address I've given is already in use, so 
use another.

And despite all that email hassle, there doesn't seem to be a way to 
interact with the forum via email, which is the only way I'd reliably 
follow it.

So at this stage of the game I'd say "don't bother."

Topping it off, there seems to be no way of removing one's own 
membership account.

Subject: [hpv] "Ninety degrees empowers your knees"
Message-ID: <49AFD24F.2010709@att.net>

Readers of Recumbent Cyclist News may remember Thad Sitton's article on 
short cranks (by which he meant crankset arms shorter than standard, not 
grumpy people who aren't tall).  After a short hiatus he has drunk the 
short crank kool-aid again.  He was back in the shop the other day with 
a newly charged campaign, complete with slogan: "Ninety degrees empowers 
your knees."

His view is that crank arm length should be selected so that the 
pedaling stroke does not require one to bend the knee past 90 degrees. 
I've seen some crank length calculators here and there, but this method 
goes more by testing and direct observation than by a biometrics formula.

He thinks that cranks are sized well for upright bikes, and observed 
that riders of such bikes don't bend their knees past 90 degrees, but 
this isn't the case when putting the same cranks on 'bents.  This makes 
sense to me, since a 'bent rider's hips are more immobilized by the 
seat, meaning the legs must flex more, whereas a roadie who is pinions 
on that little seat can bring their hips into action.

Thad had been using 153mm cranks supplied by Bikesmith Designs on his 
SWB bikes, but stopped using them after getting into trikes.  When he 
recently began experimenting again, his observation was that the short 
cranks (153mm in this case) do not feel especially "right."  What he 
noticed was that switching /back/ to the 165mm cranks on his other trike 
felt distinctly "wrong."  In fact, he is no longer satisfied with 153mm 
(it doesn't quite pass his 90 degree test) and has set Bikesmith's Mark 
Stonich to murdering another Truvativ Blaze crankset.

Does anyone else on the list have some thoughts on this matter?

Thad wants me to and my employees to try this test ourselves.  I have a 
155mm crank that I've been meaning to put on my BikeE, and I will when 
it comes in for its long overdue tuneup and cogset replacement.  My wife 
has been using a 155 set for a while and likes it, but it seems the real 
qualitative difference is noticed when experimentally switching /back/ 
to long cranks, which she hasn't done.  I'll be doing some tests on one 
of my employees once he finishes his double century this weekend to see 
what length will get him down to a 90 degree bend.  In the long run 
we'll likely do some power meter tests once I get my Ergomo fixed and we 
can do some more quantitative comparisons.

Does anyone know of power meter tests done on 'bents with varying crank 
lengths?

I did some work with this a few years back:

There should also be a link to some testing that one of the magazines did.

Interesting idea, but apparently without physiological basis. 
Why not 80 degrees, or 100? 
There is so much variability in rider physiology that any such rule is bound to fail for a significant portion of the rider population.

Hi JOHN,

It's a pleasure! Sadly before I could do more comprehensive measurements the 
power meter started playing up and I ended up with a long back and forth saga 
trying to get it replaced without any luck. It was an early Ergomo that measured 
the twist in the crank axle via two notched disks, one at each end of the axle. 
The phase difference between the two was used as a measure of torque and thence 
to power. They had a lot of trouble with manufacturing quality and I had it 
replaced once before the company was brought out. The new guys refused to take 
on the old failures... :-(

I think the cranks are a lot to do with personal preference but I do like them 
and have found going back to long cranks from time-to-time very strange. There 
is probably enough of interest going on in using short cranks to try and devise 
some more objective way of measuring. The great difficulty is that the effect of 
training - or being used to / not used to - any particular length moves the 
baseline and any effect is likely to be small rather than obviously large. Still 
the anecdotal evidence of increased comfort makes them worth a look for anyone 
experiencing pain or discomfort.

Cheerio
Rodger

I do, but have reservations on posting them, on the grounds that Children 
might be Reading.

Mike Burrows has become, in his dotage, a great proponent of short cranks. 
They allow one to spin faster, save one's knees and raise and lower Tower 
Bridge from the comfort of one's own bed.  Which is all very well, but since 
I can happily turn over 172.5 mm cranks at 120 rpm all day if necessary, I 
have difficulty in seeing how sawing off a third of the length of the crank 
is going to make any difference.

Moreover, with one set of 165s, one of 172.5s and five 170s, switching to 
short cranks across the fleet is going to cost Money, the more so when one 
considers that one will need to faff about with the gearing as well.  The 
Bank of England may have just invented a shedload more of it, but they do 
not seem keen to give any of it to me, the worthless gits.

Nothing amazing or particularly interesting there, as the reverse is
obviously true also.
