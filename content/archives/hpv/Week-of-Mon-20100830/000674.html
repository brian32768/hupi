&quot;Only&quot; $15,500 - wow.   How could you possibly get that &quot;value&quot; back in a year.  I only spend $2,500 on fuel for my real car.  

There
 is no way most people could power this by using a rowing motion.  I 
think the power comes from the batteries.  One notable problem is that 
he doesn't give the weight of the vehicle and the motor power.  It would
 be clear from that what real climbing ability it has.  Given that most 
people cannot get up any sort of grade on a regular bike, powering a 
whole vehicle like this would be impossible.  

As far as I know 
there is no such thing as a &quot;street legal low mass vehicle&quot;.  Some low 
speed electrics are allowed in SOME places with a very limited top 
speed.
