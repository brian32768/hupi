<PRE>The Human Car people are based in Southern Oregon &amp; they had the &quot;basic&quot; machine at the HPC 7 or 8 years back. I see that they've added electric &quot;assist&quot; and rudimentary bodywork, but not much has changed beyond that. I can't see how it compares to a more &quot;conventional&quot; HPV or E-assist HPV... both of which we've raced to see what works well. I don't think it's much more than someone's vision- and not necessarily a clear vision at that.
