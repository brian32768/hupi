<PRE>
FWIW, I'm developing an F# program to help me learn it, this to provide a data structure &amp; methods to simulate real-world riding better, nothing NASA would be interested in but there is no standard data now for generic frame &amp; rider performance off the track, so, the project has the goal to develop a cloud website for me to also learn to deoploy to the cloud on Azure, but I can't afford it right now anyway so Plan A is to put static charts online free from the data &amp; update those for people to use in the end.
 
Part of what's been missing is the ability to detail sections of the bike separately, they're all kinda' dumped into the Cd vs frontal-area so the whole thing is really abstracted. So, there are  param's for rider position, handlebars, frame geometry, wheels and cadence, each with its own Cd contribution to total drag, and those vary with wind-speed &amp; direction, interdependencies.
 
An important param is a gust coefficient, most natural wind conditions have shifts of wind-speed &amp; direction during an hour. In weather there's a gust factor, (avg gust speed for 3s or duration)/avg speed, you need this for track riding as well, and since most world records were measured on them, all that data can be used to begin with to calibrate things to start (Merckx's piste had a listed Cd of 0.75, 485-watts to go under 50-km's, Boardman's mono-piste built by Merckx was 0.165 &amp; took 445-watts to go over 6-km's farther in an hour). I'm using the charts from <A HREF="http://www.bikecult.com/bikecultbook/sports_recordsHour.html">http://www.bikecult.com/bikecultbook/sports_recordsHour.html</A> for numbers ...
 
Curious if this may be of use to anyone on the list?
