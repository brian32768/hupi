<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> it took some knowledge of its dynamics to make such a different

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer aided control
</I>
I'm not convinced. The big issue for rear steering only on roads
is curbs. To move away from a curb the rear steer has to move the
rear end towards the curb. Which kind of works with the Dymaxion
because it's wider at the front than the rear. But for a rectangular
vehicle that's not possible. So you have to reverse away from the
curb. Which is bearable for parking, but easily fatal when you
drift too close to a motorway barrier.

Remember, on the road it's all about failure modes. Just working
is not enough, it has to fail gracefully.

&gt;<i> What made it work was the friction he included to control its
</I>&gt;<i> tendency to oscillate with a positive feedback.
</I>
This is the bit that computer control can fix. Some fighter planes
IIRC are so grossly unstable that humans can't operate them without
computer control. Which is great for maneuverability, but not so hot
if the computer fails.
