Yes, they crashed but had good PR.

My recollection is that after one car overturned, they only allowed 
professional race car drivers to drive them (I think on the basis that 
they had good reflexes and were used to driving all sorts of wild things).

Some of what Bucky did was amazing, some of it was smoke and mirrors.

He would have been a great HPV'er, he was perfectly willing to try 
things that we all just know don't work, like rear wheel steering. Too 
bad it does not really work...

Seems to me the FlevoBike was kind of like that. Someone will probably 
pipe up now and say the FlevoBike was the best thing ever invented.

One thing I learned hanging out in the HPV world is that human beings 
can ride damn near anything with 1 or more wheels on it, and often even 
have fun with it.

This is a good read: <A HREF="http://dymaxioncar.com/restoration.html">http://dymaxioncar.com/restoration.html</A>
