<PRE>We had a&#160;phenomenal wipe-out at the Fl HPV race a few years&#160;back. Somebody not involved with the usual HPV bunch had designed a streamliner with front wheel drive and two back steer wheels. While flying high on the turn at the velodrome the&#160;steering&#160;gave way and the thing spun round and almost over the top. The driver/rider was not hurt but his ride was out of commission.

Yes, they crashed but had good PR.

My recollection is that after one car overturned, they only allowed professional race car drivers to drive them (I think on the basis that they had good reflexes and were used to driving all sorts of wild things).
