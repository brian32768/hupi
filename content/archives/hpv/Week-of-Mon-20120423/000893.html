&gt;<i> My recollection was that they were demonstrated by people with experience in the airplanes of the time; i.e. taildraggers with the same basic layout. The thing is, it took some knowledge of its dynamics to make such a different car practical back then. In this age it would only need some computer aided control like the sort that now makes model helicopters flyable for a wide variety of people when not so long ago it was far too difficult.

Eric Edwards streamliner Pegasus is rear steering and I managed to get it around the San Diego Velodrome once a long time ago even though it was designed only for straight line speed.  What made it work ( just barely) was the friction he included to control its tendency to oscillate with a positive feedback. It also was set up to have the steering axis line reach the ground forward of the contact patch as most steering needs. It did have trail, but only within a narrow range of its motion, so that I had it at full lock most of the way around the oval and entered the corners as wide as possible. Bucky's machine couldn't have had such strictures and do what he promised it could do. Today we would just build it with all-wheel steering and stability controls like modern cars.  

The rear engine idea did not die with the Dymaxion as anyone who owned a VW or a Corvair can attest. I owned both at one time. I took my VW up to Big Bear lake in winter once and experienced what even that variation can do to a car's handling when I hit glare ice, did a complete 360 degrees at speed and kept on going to the ski slopes thanking my lucky stars.
