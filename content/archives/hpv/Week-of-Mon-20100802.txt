Hey all I need to replace the panniers on my Trice. My Radical Side
bags (large) are like these:

https://www.radicaldesign.nl/en/products/recumbent-bags/side-panniers/side-panniers-l

and they have worked out well, but age and sun exposure have made the
fabric prone to ripping. This set was sewn with thread that didn't
work out too well, and I have had to sew the zippers back into place
with nylon thread many times along the way.

My question is: Do any of you have a suggestion for something that
would serve me better? I use them for shopping so the large volume (70
litre) is nice. Rain proof is not really a requirement, but durability
and easy access are pluses.

Here's a picture that shows how they fit behind the seat:

I'm using kitty-litter buckets with a resealable lid on my bike. The
40 pound size will swallow huge amounts of cargo (including gallon
jugs of milk) with ample room and easily support 40 pounds of contents
(duh). They are easy to get via Freecycle as people with cats usually
just keep the first two or three buckets and then toss the rest.
