<PRE>A couple of our fastest local riders in all conditions ride a  
lowracer. John Foltz and Chris ?. They can still drop nearly all  
uprighters, especially of similar fitness, even on uphills of all but  
steepest/longest grades.

I do note that they seem SLIGHTLY slower on the ups, but that doesn't  
hold them back much -- they can still push open a gap if need be. I  
suppose at that point they might be exerting MORE than the  
uprighters. But maybe not.

Often the speeds are such that they're still getting good aero perks.

I used to ride a lowracer with them. I think that excellent uphill  
performance came to all of us only after *a COUPLE YEARS of hard  
work*. The uphills did seem to take a *much SHARPER effort* than with  
an upright. Punchier, more forceful. It was a distinctly different  
feel than upright climbing and took serious longterm adaptation.

However, our lowracers back then were fairly heavy. (I've gone to  
more group-riding dynamics -- rotating pacelines, etc. -- and sold my  
HPV. I couldn't maintain the fairing in my limited space/time -- it  
was getting scrunched in my small garage, etc. I resented the 30+ lb  
bike, too.) The other 2 guys now ride ultralight carbon and seem very  
pleased with the results in all conditions. They may no longer need  
so much of the &quot;sharp&quot; efforts to put the uphill hurt on uprights.

My main point was the 2-year sharp effort adaption to superior uphill  
skills. Any testing/comparison would need to include that for fairness.

Possibly this is an &quot;overhead&quot; requirement that should be noted as  
part of the &quot;cost&quot; of 'benting. Such a learning (adapting) curve  
might be rejected in many activities. Well, chess is known to take a  
few years -- I suppose lots of highly technical activities are known  
to take a long time. Motor-racing, for instance.
