<PRE>No calculations here; just a little personal experience from riding a lot of
big hills in the last 10 years or so on recumbent. It's mostly a skill
thing, even more than a fitness thing. I know Pittsburgh hills can be very
steep. Thing one is to have some nice low gears so you can maintain a
reasonable cadence while climbing. My lowest gear is 30 front/34 rear and I
do use it, especially late in a long ride or up a very long or steep hill.
Thing two is the skills in balancing. It comes with time and focus. Practice
riding 2&quot; from the edge of a painted road line. You have to overcome the
natural tendency of the pedaling to steer the bike since the pedals are
often forward of the front wheel. Also practice riding very slowly and
maintaining a straight line. I can now ride 4 mph in a very straight line up
a big hill if need be, and 3 mph if I concentrate. So for me, the recumbent
is no issue regarding stability. 

Is climbing slower on a recumbent? That has got to be the biggest debate
around with no clear answers. As for standing up, if you watch the pros on
long climbs, they stay seated. Standing generates a lot of power but at a
cost. If you develop a good ability to spin (i.e. fast spin instead of
pushing hard--work your way to up to being comfortable at a sustained 90-100
rpm) then climbing should be much easier. But it still seems slower. I have
two pet theories on this that might both have elements of truth:

a. Recumbents have aerodynamic advantages on flats and downhills so that
people I can ride with easily on the flats will usually be able to outclimb
me, thus it seems like the recumbent is slower on hills. If I ride with
riders that are too slow for me on the flats, I outclimb them just fine. 

b. It has to do with the angle of the hill. Going up a hill changes the
angle of the riders legs relative to &quot;flat&quot; ground. So it makes it harder to
pedal. This is not very logical and this pains me, being an engineer by
training and career! Picture an extreme case--a bike where your back is
horizontal and the pedals are directly above your hips. Seems like that
would be harder to ride, since the pushing is all straight UP! So when the
bike turns up hill there is a little of this effect. Or this is all in my
head :) Sometimes I think that maybe if my seat raised an amount equal to
the rise in the road, it would be easier to climb.

In my experience, this is a big disadvantage of recumbents. In addition to
the higher natural frequency of the inverted pendulum, the recumbent makes
it difficult for the rider to maneuver his body for control, as is done on
an upright bike. The inability to stand on the pedals for hill climbing is
also frustrating for me. (OK, maybe I don't have my &quot;recumbent legs.&quot;)
Putting this all together, I find hill-climbing on a recumbent relatively
difficult, and sometimes dangerous due to poor steering control. I'm sure
this is more of a problem for me on Pittsburgh hills, than to flat-landers.

A couple ideas on how to mitigate this problem:
* A &quot;landing gear&quot; that is deployed for static stability during low-speed
riding. This would be a great help for starting on steep hills. This has
some problems with side slopes, and sharing the load with the driving wheel.
Also, it can be pretty bulky and heavy.
* An assist motor, so you can maintain reasonable speed on hills. This could
also help with starts, as you could keep feet down for balance while
starting.
* A gyro wheel to help stabilize the bike (e.g. 
<A HREF="http://www.thegyrobike.com/">http://www.thegyrobike.com/</A>). This works largely by generating steering
inputs to maintain stability. I have played with this concept on a
recumbent, and it seems to help. It does add weight and complexity, and
requires power to run the gyro.

</I>&gt;<i> I assume you want to compare moments of inertia, not angular momenta.  
</I>&gt;<i> You are correct that the smaller the moment of inertia, about an axis 
</I>&gt;<i> that connects the contact points, the faster the object &quot;falls&quot; under 
</I>&gt;<i> the torque of gravity.
</I>&gt;<i> Specific comparisons depend on the details of the bike and rider 
</I>&gt;<i> combination, of course.  With the spongy rider constituting the 
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the mass, rider position makes a big difference.  
</I>&gt;<i> Recumbents give somewhat less flexibility of position than uprights, 
</I>&gt;<i> so the common approximation of a rigid body works a little better for them
</I>than for uprights.
&gt;<i> The Physics principle is that the moment of inertia you are looking 
</I>&gt;<i> for is the sum (or integral) of an infinite number of products.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> things you are adding up are each tiny bit of mass times the square of 
</I>&gt;<i> its distance from the axis referenced above.  Since the moment of 
</I>&gt;<i> inertia depends on how far the mass is from the axis _squared_, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> generally not sufficient to locate only the center of mass.  But, that 
</I>&gt;<i> will give you a very rough basis for comparison.  Even rougher, ignore 
</I>&gt;<i> the bike's mass and simply locate the center of mass of the rider 
</I>&gt;<i> (usually around the navel).  The higher that is above the ground, the
</I>larger the relevant moment of inertia.
