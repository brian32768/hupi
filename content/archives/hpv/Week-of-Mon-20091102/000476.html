<PRE>No doubt about that. I would never try to draw conclusions from anyone who
was new to the sport or the type of bike. That's why data is so hard to come
by! Nevertheless, some recumbent bikes (like the Lightning I ride now) have
very much the same body angles as uprights so it's hard to see how different
muscles are being used. The only difference I see, and this could be
significant, is the direction the muscle is exerting relative to the
direction of gravity. Should this make a difference?

 

One could imagine a controlled experiment using identical electric motors
propelling various bikes, equalized for weight and turning the pedals with
the same cadence and force over various terrain. The race is on. 

 

PhD project anyone?

&gt;<i>What puzzles me, is ME. That is, anecdotal and experiential &quot;evidence&quot; that

train as much as many ultra distance riders, was about equivalent in
size/weight, total rolling weight about the same, easy to stay with them on
flats with no wind, but I would immediately fall off the back when we hit
even a modest hill, and I'd have to work like a DOG to stay with them. 

 

......I have a theory (of course). With the up right position even when your
not on the bike your using similar muscles. On a recumbent you using a
different set of muscles. Ones that are not being exercised daily as we walk
or climb stairs.  So the up right muscles are getting a bit of exercise on a
daily bases maintaining slightly better muscle tone. You said you train as
much as they do, but in reality your loosing more than they are. We all know
that it only takes a few days to loose muscle tone, and many days to get it
back. 

 

For the Deadulus (sp?) HPA they experimented with up right and recumbent
positions. They were hoping for the recumbent position to reduce aero drag.
When they first started training the riders the recumbent position had lower
long term power capability. But in 6 weeks of daily training they found the
recumbent position had the same power capability.
