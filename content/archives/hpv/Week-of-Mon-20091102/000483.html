</I>..........Its more than body angle. When I got my P-38, my first recumbent, I had a hard time climbing any hill in comparison to the up right I had.   It took me a couple of seasons to get really good. I hear this from many new Bent riders. 

Now most of my bikes have so called high BBs and when on occasions I do ride the P-38 with its relatively low BB I don't do well on it at all. Trying to ride say a Tour Easy which has a very low BB is a disaster for me. 

Therefore all of my bikes have the same seat to BB height. 

Sam Whittingham years ago learned to train on a bike that has the identical BB to seat height as the Varna.  Same with Greg Kolodziejzyk and his record breaking vehicles. 

Its pretty clear and well known that BB height does make a difference and requires re-training for different heights.  

Therefore I still claim that the process of every day walking and climbing stairs helps maintain the up right riders muscle tone more than the recumbent position. 

If we look at climbing power difference between a light weight up right and a heavier recumbent we also can see another difference. 

Lets say the up right conditions are  CdA 2.9. Cr .005, rider weight 170 lbs,  bike 17 lbs, drive train eff of 97%.   To climb a 6% grade at 6 mph requires 159 watts. 

For the recumbent the CdA is 2.4 Crr .0055, same rider weight of 170 lbs, bike 30 lbs, drive train eff 94% (intermediate idler). The climb power is 170  watts. 11 additional watts doesn't sound like a lot. To get the power down to the same as the up right the speed would have to drop to 5.6 mph which is about the speed difference between these two vehicles. If the recumbent tries to accelerate say 0.1 mph per second the power jumps to 182 watts. 

If we look at a long term human power capability curves we see a fairly steep fall off vs power increase. 10 or 20 additional watts doesn't sound like a lot but when your heart rate is high, your breathing hard and your legs are staring to burn that 10 to 20 watts hurts. 
Tie in a drop off in muscle tone during the week and we don't do well climbing. 

I ride a VM all winter on almost a daily bases. I love riding with the up rights who rode only sporadically during the winter. Needless to say I have no problems staying ahead of most of them.
