I have noticed both a. and b. I've done steep climbs on a wide range  
of recumbent geometries and the ones that seem easiest to pedal on  
steep climbs are those with relatively upright seats and low bottom  
brackets while the very laid back high bottom bracket bikes feel like  
I'm working harder for a given heart rate. This could be in part  
because the more horizontal the body is the lower the heart rate is  
due to the way blood flow works in relation to gravity. I have one  
laid back bike with the bottom bracket much higher than the seat  
where it feels like I'm working very hard to maintain 140 beats per  
minute while another with a more upright seat and low bottom bracket  
it is fairly easy to maintain 150 beats per minute. I'd like to get a  
watt meter so I can see how the power output compares for various  
positions for a given heart rate.
