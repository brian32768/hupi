<PRE>Hi Paul et al,

Yes, that's the mystery indeed. From a theoretical physics point of view,
there should be no difference in climbing, since we can neglect air
resistance, and the weight difference in bikes is easily overcome by rider
weight differences or even a bottle or two of water! To really get good
data, we'd need to control for rider fitness and weight, and there just
isn't enough data. 

What puzzles me, is ME. That is, anecdotal and experiential &quot;evidence&quot; that
seems to contradict or at least mitigate the obvious physics. I used to
train as much as many ultra distance riders, was about equivalent in
size/weight, total rolling weight about the same, easy to stay with them on
flats with no wind, but I would immediately fall off the back when we hit
even a modest hill, and I'd have to work like a DOG to stay with them. 

I intend no offense here either, but many recumbent riders just don't train
very hard, are overweight, etc. so they don't really provide good data here.
It's easy to dismiss their slow climbing as just a lower fitness or training
level (and more power to them for getting out and riding no matter their
level of course!). I would ask people on the list: compared to your riding
buddies, who ride about the same amount as you, are about the same age and
general fitness level (height/weight proportion, etc.) how do you climb
compared to them? If recumbents were no different than uprights, there would
be no difference. And I would find myself in the middle of the packs I ride
with. But I don't. You may say, well, you're just the weakest rider in the
pack, and perhaps so, but this is 10 years of experience riding with racing
clubs and fast sport clubs, large century rides, etc. where I'm normally the
only recumbent rider on the ride out of dozens of others. 

To the scientists on the list, I would put the challenge: come up with a
theory to explain the anecdotal experiences people keep sharing. WHY DO
recumbent have the reputation for climbing slowly. Your theory doesn't
explain this. Note for example, that no one is claiming that steel bikes
climb slower than carbon--there's no anecdotal evidence for this, so no one
need put forward theories. But there is for the recumbent thing. 

There's a principle in the scientific method that I'm sure you're familiar
with... that you can't use the data from which a theory was derived, as
evidence for the theory's validity. So one can't claim that because they did
this or that calculation or lab test and from that they concluded that X is
so, that this proves that X is so. One would need to test the theory
independently with new data. Where is that data that shows that recumbents
climb as well as uprights, controlling for weight? 

Hopefully this isn't road that's been traveled before in this discussion!

I really would like to get to the bottom of this climbing difference. Claims
that there is no difference don't seem convincing to my experience and the
anecdotal evidence. 

It's a nice day here in coastal NC... I'm going to go ride!

PS Nice to hear from you Zach... interesting thoughts regarding human
anatomy as making a difference in the position. You know how I like to put
an air cushion thermarest seat on my Lightning? I was thinking if one could
have a thicker one that could be pumped up in prep for a climb. Hmm can
someone do the trig to figure out how much a seat needs to be raised to make
up for a 6% grade, given an average x-seam length?

Barclay changed the subject, but I'll bite on the old hill climbing debate.
I think his suggestions for making climbing easier on a recumbent are very 
good, generally more practical than Ben Brown's (no offense).  Weight is 
your enemy here, so anything that adds weight (landing gear, gyros,...) is a

step in the wrong direction.  Unless that direction is toward designing an 
automobile.

The &quot;big debate&quot; he refers to does have a clear answer, at least one I can 
defend with basic physics.  I think the question may be simply stated: does 
either platform, upright bike or recumbent bike, have an _intrinsic_ 
advantage when climbing hills.  If we control for all other variables, in 
particular total mass and rider's power output capability, then the answer 
is no.  The rate of climb is directly proportional to Power divided by Mass.

This is easier to see if you restrict the comparison to long, steady, slow 
climbs, so that transient effects of engaging other muscle groups or 
different starting speeds become negligible.  If we consider lower 
aerodynamic drag as intrinsic to the recumbent, then the recumbent has an 
advantage even in climbing, but that advantage becomes vanishingly small at 
low speeds.

It is generally agreed that a reasonably fit rider can use all of his 
cardio-pulmonary capacity with his legs, so that max sustainable power is 
not significantly affected by standing on the pedals or otherwise utilizing 
the different positions offered by an upright.  A well-designed recumbent 
does not restrict breathing or add more friction of any kind.  The 
biomechanical stuff can get complicated, but the human body is extremely 
adaptable.  So if we allow for sufficient training, I would contend that 
there is no significant difference in the efficiency of delivering the 
rider's maximum power to the pedals, that is intrinsic to the recumbent 
position vs. the upright.

One could argue that greater mass IS intrinsic to the recumbent compared to 
the upright.  If so, then the advantage goes to the upright in proportion to

the mass ratio and how steep the hill is.  It remains generally true that 
for the same cost/quality level, an upright bike will tend to weigh less 
than a recumbent.  I think this contributes to the common perception, along 
with a possible sampling bias in the masses and fitness levels of the 
respective groups of actual riders.

Barclay's comments in his point a. are right on, and also a factor in group 
rides on flat terrain when there is wind.  On a headwind leg, I'm cruising 
with the bike club guys, no worries.  Comes a long tailwind stretch, and I'm

dropped like a physics class that is no longer required.  Seems ironic, but 
it makes perfect sense when you think about it.

I don't think there is any relevant objective reality in Barclay's point b. 
(no offense)

&gt;<i> No calculations here; just a little personal experience from riding a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> big hills in the last 10 years or so on recumbent. It's mostly a skill
</I>&gt;<i> thing, even more than a fitness thing. I know Pittsburgh hills can be very
</I>&gt;<i> steep. Thing one is to have some nice low gears so you can maintain a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable cadence while climbing. My lowest gear is 30 front/34 rear and 
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> do use it, especially late in a long ride or up a very long or steep hill.
</I>&gt;<i> Thing two is the skills in balancing. It comes with time and focus. 
</I>&gt;<i> Practice
</I>&gt;<i> riding 2&quot; from the edge of a painted road line. You have to overcome the
</I>&gt;<i> natural tendency of the pedaling to steer the bike since the pedals are
</I>&gt;<i> often forward of the front wheel. Also practice riding very slowly and
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining a straight line. I can now ride 4 mph in a very straight line 
</I>&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;<i> a big hill if need be, and 3 mph if I concentrate. So for me, the 
</I>&gt;<i> recumbent
</I>&gt;<i> is no issue regarding stability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is climbing slower on a recumbent? That has got to be the biggest debate
</I>&gt;<i> around with no clear answers. As for standing up, if you watch the pros on
</I>&gt;<i> long climbs, they stay seated. Standing generates a lot of power but at a
</I>&gt;<i> cost. If you develop a good ability to spin (i.e. fast spin instead of
</I>&gt;<i> pushing hard--work your way to up to being comfortable at a sustained 
</I>&gt;<i> 90-100
</I>&gt;<i> rpm) then climbing should be much easier. But it still seems slower. I 
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> two pet theories on this that might both have elements of truth:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a. Recumbents have aerodynamic advantages on flats and downhills so that
</I>&gt;<i> people I can ride with easily on the flats will usually be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> outclimb
</I>&gt;<i> me, thus it seems like the recumbent is slower on hills. If I ride with
</I>&gt;<i> riders that are too slow for me on the flats, I outclimb them just fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b. It has to do with the angle of the hill. Going up a hill changes the
</I>&gt;<i> angle of the riders legs relative to &quot;flat&quot; ground. So it makes it harder 
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> pedal. This is not very logical and this pains me, being an engineer by
</I>&gt;<i> training and career! Picture an extreme case--a bike where your back is
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal and the pedals are directly above your hips. Seems like that
</I>&gt;<i> would be harder to ride, since the pushing is all straight UP! So when the
</I>&gt;<i> bike turns up hill there is a little of this effect. Or this is all in my
</I>&gt;<i> head :) Sometimes I think that maybe if my seat raised an amount equal to
</I>&gt;<i> the rise in the road, it would be easier to climb.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my experience, this is a big disadvantage of recumbents. In addition to
</I>&gt;<i> the higher natural frequency of the inverted pendulum, the recumbent makes
</I>&gt;<i> it difficult for the rider to maneuver his body for control, as is done on
</I>&gt;<i> an upright bike. The inability to stand on the pedals for hill climbing is
</I>&gt;<i> also frustrating for me. (OK, maybe I don't have my &quot;recumbent legs.&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> Putting this all together, I find hill-climbing on a recumbent relatively
</I>&gt;<i> difficult, and sometimes dangerous due to poor steering control. I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> this is more of a problem for me on Pittsburgh hills, than to 
</I>&gt;<i> flat-landers.
