Actually, it does. Since the gauntlet has been thrown at scientists (I'm a Physics and Math guy) I'll take it up. My theory is simple: training. I'm pretty good uphill on a recumbent for a guy in my age+weight category (old heavyweight boxer) because I've been riding recumbent since 1991 -- but I've been riding a hunker-bike since 1952. That's a big difference. Here's an anecdotal experience to contemplate: my youngest (fifty-something) brother told me he'd rather have a baseball-bat than a samaurai-sword in a fight. Clearly the sword is a vastly superior weapon, so why the choice of bat? Simple: training. He played baseball for many years, and spent many hundreds of hours in the batting cage, so he's good with a bat. With a sword, zero hours training -- so of course he's better with the artefact with which he's had more training. It's that simple.
