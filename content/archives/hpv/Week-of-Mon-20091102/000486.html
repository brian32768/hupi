<PRE>I've been riding since I don't know when.  My first bike was so big I could only ride it because it was a ladies design with a dropped top tube. If I hung from the bars like a gibbon, I could just reach the pedals.

I raced ABL in high school, badly, but I loved the training rides. I've toured most of the state of AZ and big parts of Nor Cal. I built my current double diamond frame as a practice run, hoping someday to build my own Greenspeed -- not going to happen! I can't see well enough to get the brass fill right and its whole heck of allot of work filing bad joints.
  
I have always been a climber but it sound like some of you would drop me on the flats in a heart beat. My wife married me for my legs, etc. My inseam is 35&quot;, and I am 'slight' in the upper body. I have a hard time keeping my laptop case strap on my shoulder.

When I was finishing my graduate degree in Nutrition and Biochemistry, I got to spend some time with an uncle who had trained horses all of his life.  He &quot;placed&quot; with  one in the Kentucky Derby.  I thought I knew something about actin and myosin and fast twitch vs. slow, so I was shocked to learn that horses are not trained the way we train human athletes.  They can run or not.  It all about genetics.

The math and physics guy got the sinusoidal path right.  Maybe he can comment on lever length and mechanical advantage as well. I've ridin enough bents to know that it is tough for me to get my weight (gravity), my abdominals, my forearms and my legs working they way they work on an old school racer.

It sounds like the Cruz bike lady is built for bent speed. My guess is that it's a special breed that climbs well on a recumbent.  We don't pull beer wagons with Arabians and we don't race flat track with Clydesdales.
