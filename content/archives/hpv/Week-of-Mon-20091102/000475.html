&gt;<i>What puzzles me, is ME. That is, anecdotal and experiential &quot;evidence&quot; that

train as much as many ultra distance riders, was about equivalent in
size/weight, total rolling weight about the same, easy to stay with them on
flats with no wind, but I would immediately fall off the back when we hit
even a modest hill, and I'd have to work like a DOG to stay with them. 

......I have a theory (of course). With the up right position even when your not on the bike your using similar muscles. On a recumbent you using a different set of muscles. Ones that are not being exercised daily as we walk or climb stairs.  So the up right muscles are getting a bit of exercise on a daily bases maintaining slightly better muscle tone. You said you train as much as they do, but in reality your loosing more than they are. We all know that it only takes a few days to loose muscle tone, and many days to get it back. 

For the Deadulus (sp?) HPA they experimented with up right and recumbent positions. They were hoping for the recumbent position to reduce aero drag. When they first started training the riders the recumbent position had lower long term power capability. But in 6 weeks of daily training they found the recumbent position had the same power capability.
