<PRE>Hi Cornel,

Well, it's possible. We probably need more data, since I'm at least one
counter-example. Yes I rode an upright bike from about age 10 to age 19,
then no riding at all until age 40 when I started riding on a recumbent.
I've ridden only recumbent since then, and have put on many times the
mileage of my teenage experience. Anyway, I have a feeling that recent
experience should count for more than decades-old experience. Let your
brother train in Kendo for a year, and I bet he'll prefer the sword over the
bat. Seems also that we have some evidence that there is pretty good
transfer of training between different types of bicycles. Those who set
speed records on recumbent usually have long experience riding uprights,
racing history, lots of training, etc. and a relatively short exposure to
the recumbent. Was it Sam Wittingham who said in an interview that he keeps
sharp and fast by being a Cat 2 racer as he's setting 60+ mph records on an
enclosed low racer style recumbent?

Part of my anecdotal annoyance with this issue is that I also find myself
being challenged at hill climbing by even far inferior cyclists. Let's say
I'm riding with a casual rider, one who has never trained hard, never ridden
more than say 40 mi at a time, rides regularly but not a high volume, etc.
He (or even she!) can often make me work quite hard to keep up on a modest
hill, while I can handily beat them by hours on a 50 mile ride or a century.
They are uncomfortable above 16 mph on flats, while I can easily maintain
20-22 for hours. But up a hill we suddenly seem much, much closer in
ability. In the cases I have in mind, I can beat them up the hill but I have
to multiply my effort by several times to do it. Yes, they work harder on
the hill too, but it feels like they are going from effort level 5 to 7 and
I'm going from level say 3 to level 9. This happens so often it's shocking.
Does anyone else notice this?

One more little story. I used to ride every week with the San Diego Bicycle
Club, the big racing club in that town. I was the only recumbent. It was a
40 mile, high intensity ride, same course every week. They called it a race
without a fee. After a few mile warm up, the first hill comes and everyone
attacks. For a while I would get so soundly dropped on this hill that I'd
never see most of the riders again. Later I learned to follow a different
strategy. On the flat road approaching this hill, I would ride off the front
of the pack, putting as much lead on them as I could in the say, 1 mile
stretch (I'd often tell the pack leaders that I'd see them on the hill so
they wouldn't take this as an attack and follow me). Then I'd hit the hill
alone and give it all I had, sometimes reaching within a beat or so of my
MAX heart rate. The fastest riders in the group would catch me just as I
reached the top of the hill and I'd be fine riding with them for the rest of
the ride. Having that extra 20 or 30 seconds on the hill made that much
difference in the rest of the ride. It SEEMED to me that I had to get that
extra time to make up for my inherently slower bike. 

One more data point: Pete Penseyres, a well known record-setting recumbent
rider/racer and also all-time average speed record holder in the Race Across
America (on an upright) once told me after riding with me quite a bit on his
weekly group ride, that if I got on an upright I'd be able to beat about
half of the present group up hills. Just his opinion of course, but
definitely an experienced source. 

Anyone else having things like this happen?

Interesting conversation!

Barclay

Actually, it does. Since the gauntlet has been thrown at scientists (I'm a
Physics and Math guy) I'll take it up. My theory is simple: training. I'm
pretty good uphill on a recumbent for a guy in my age+weight category (old
heavyweight boxer) because I've been riding recumbent since 1991 -- but I've
been riding a hunker-bike since 1952. That's a big difference. Here's an
anecdotal experience to contemplate: my youngest (fifty-something) brother
told me he'd rather have a baseball-bat than a samaurai-sword in a fight.
Clearly the sword is a vastly superior weapon, so why the choice of bat?
Simple: training. He played baseball for many years, and spent many hundreds
of hours in the batting cage, so he's good with a bat. With a sword, zero
hours training -- so of course he's better with the artefact with which he's
had more training. It's that simple.
