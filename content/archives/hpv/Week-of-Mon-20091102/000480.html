<PRE>OK, I'll bite on the hill-climbing issue, too. Here's my opinion: the upper
body engagement that upright road bikers employ when hill-climbing is
advantageous.  The shortest way up a hill is a straight line, but the
fastest way up a hill is a sinusoidal path.  Watch any good video footage of
the mountain sections of the Tour de France and you'll see what I mean.

My wife and I ride the MBB-FWD Cruzbike.  Prior to 2007, we had zero bicycle
racing experience.  We noticed on hilly rides like Bon Ton Roulet in NY,
Bike Virginia, and the CNC (Ride Across NC), we were relatively fast going
up hills and we were working our upper body much like the road bike riders.
 There are a lot of recumbents on these rides, and we have NEVER been passed
by a recumbent going up a hill.  We also passed most of the road bikes on
the hills.  I weigh close to 200 lbs.  On the climbs, I would pass just
about any road bike rider of a similar weight to me.  Other recumbent riders
were dubious of our reports of hill climbing ability.  They said &quot;that's
just marketing hype, prove it by entering a race.&quot;   So we entered the
12-hour UMCA race in hilly Saratoga County, NY this past July.  I finished
5th overall among the men and Maria, my wife, finished first among the
women.  Not only that, Maria rode the course faster than any woman on a road
bike has EVER ridden the course, setting a recumbent record that surpassed
the road bike course record.

Not content to stop there, she set the women's UMCA recumbent 12-hour world
record (pending certification), surpassing the 240 mile record set by Nancy
Raposo on a road bike.  Raposo was in her early 30's and an established
distance bicycling champion when she set the 12-hour record.  Maria is a 46
year-old housewife who clicked her feet into her first racing pedals about
one year ago.  How can you explain this?  Maria should get a lot of credit
for a hard effort, but the Cruzbike Silvio gives her the aero advantage of a
recumbent and the whole body power generation of a road bike.  It's an
unbeatable combination.  Someday I hope this technology catches the
attention of a few serious cyclists who will take the time to learn the
technique; then the records will really start falling.

&gt;<i> Hi Cornel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it's possible. We probably need more data, since I'm at least one
</I>&gt;<i> counter-example. Yes I rode an upright bike from about age 10 to age 19,
</I>&gt;<i> then no riding at all until age 40 when I started riding on a recumbent.
</I>&gt;<i> I've ridden only recumbent since then, and have put on many times the
</I>&gt;<i> mileage of my teenage experience. Anyway, I have a feeling that recent
</I>&gt;<i> experience should count for more than decades-old experience. Let your
</I>&gt;<i> brother train in Kendo for a year, and I bet he'll prefer the sword over
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> bat. Seems also that we have some evidence that there is pretty good
</I>&gt;<i> transfer of training between different types of bicycles. Those who set
</I>&gt;<i> speed records on recumbent usually have long experience riding uprights,
</I>&gt;<i> racing history, lots of training, etc. and a relatively short exposure to
</I>&gt;<i> the recumbent. Was it Sam Wittingham who said in an interview that he keeps
</I>&gt;<i> sharp and fast by being a Cat 2 racer as he's setting 60+ mph records on an
</I>&gt;<i> enclosed low racer style recumbent?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of my anecdotal annoyance with this issue is that I also find myself
</I>&gt;<i> being challenged at hill climbing by even far inferior cyclists. Let's say
</I>&gt;<i> I'm riding with a casual rider, one who has never trained hard, never
</I>&gt;<i> ridden
</I>&gt;<i> more than say 40 mi at a time, rides regularly but not a high volume, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> He (or even she!) can often make me work quite hard to keep up on a modest
</I>&gt;<i> hill, while I can handily beat them by hours on a 50 mile ride or a
</I>&gt;<i> century.
</I>&gt;<i> They are uncomfortable above 16 mph on flats, while I can easily maintain
</I>&gt;<i> 20-22 for hours. But up a hill we suddenly seem much, much closer in
</I>&gt;<i> ability. In the cases I have in mind, I can beat them up the hill but I
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> to multiply my effort by several times to do it. Yes, they work harder on
</I>&gt;<i> the hill too, but it feels like they are going from effort level 5 to 7 and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going from level say 3 to level 9. This happens so often it's shocking.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone else notice this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One more little story. I used to ride every week with the San Diego Bicycle
</I>&gt;<i> Club, the big racing club in that town. I was the only recumbent. It was a
</I>&gt;<i> 40 mile, high intensity ride, same course every week. They called it a race
</I>&gt;<i> without a fee. After a few mile warm up, the first hill comes and everyone
</I>&gt;<i> attacks. For a while I would get so soundly dropped on this hill that I'd
</I>&gt;<i> never see most of the riders again. Later I learned to follow a different
</I>&gt;<i> strategy. On the flat road approaching this hill, I would ride off the
</I>&gt;<i> front
</I>&gt;<i> of the pack, putting as much lead on them as I could in the say, 1 mile
</I>&gt;<i> stretch (I'd often tell the pack leaders that I'd see them on the hill so
</I>&gt;<i> they wouldn't take this as an attack and follow me). Then I'd hit the hill
</I>&gt;<i> alone and give it all I had, sometimes reaching within a beat or so of my
</I>&gt;<i> MAX heart rate. The fastest riders in the group would catch me just as I
</I>&gt;<i> reached the top of the hill and I'd be fine riding with them for the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the ride. Having that extra 20 or 30 seconds on the hill made that much
</I>&gt;<i> difference in the rest of the ride. It SEEMED to me that I had to get that
</I>&gt;<i> extra time to make up for my inherently slower bike.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One more data point: Pete Penseyres, a well known record-setting recumbent
</I>&gt;<i> rider/racer and also all-time average speed record holder in the Race
</I>&gt;<i> Across
</I>&gt;<i> America (on an upright) once told me after riding with me quite a bit on
</I>&gt;<i> his
</I>&gt;<i> weekly group ride, that if I got on an upright I'd be able to beat about
</I>&gt;<i> half of the present group up hills. Just his opinion of course, but
</I>&gt;<i> definitely an experienced source.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone else having things like this happen?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting conversation!

</I>&gt;<i> hours training -- so of course he's better with the artefact with which

</I>&gt;<i> had more training. It's that simple.
