<PRE>I tend to agree with Cornell and I'll add that by the time most riders
switch to recumbents their fitness has eroded due various issues that
stimulated their interest in recumbents. When they don't magically
recover their speed in all conditions, they blame the bike when the
engine is the cause.  Few bike shops are staffed with competent
recumbent riders so they accept the feedback from their new recumbent
customers  at face value and pass it on.

I was an OK climber when I started riding recumbents. OK meaning I
could climb every hill but definitely a middle of the pack rider.
After a lengthy acclimatization and learning phase  which I'm
embarrassed to admit took 2 years, I developed more confidence with
climbing. Since converting to recumbents in 95, I've done harder rides
than I ever did as a DF rider. I even became a bit cocky while doing
hilly club rides  and discovering that sometimes I made it to the top
first but never last.   These days, at 60, I don't dominate climbs as
much but I sure enjoy passing the uninformed DF riders  who say
recumbents can't climb.

</I>&gt;<i> Actually, it does. Since the gauntlet has been thrown at scientists (I'm a Physics and Math guy) I'll take it up. My theory is simple: training. I'm pretty good uphill on a recumbent for a guy in my age+weight category (old heavyweight boxer) because I've been riding recumbent since 1991 -- but I've been riding a hunker-bike since 1952. That's a big difference. Here's an anecdotal experience to contemplate: my youngest (fifty-something) brother told me he'd rather have a baseball-bat than a samaurai-sword in a fight. Clearly the sword is a vastly superior weapon, so why the choice of bat? Simple: training. He played baseball for many years, and spent many hundreds of hours in the batting cage, so he's good with a bat. With a sword, zero hours training -- so of course he's better with the artefact with which he's had more training. It's that simple.
