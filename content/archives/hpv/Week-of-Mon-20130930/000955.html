</I>&gt;<i> It isn't my nature to follow the latest trend, never has been. While recumbent riders are significantly in decline along with the style of riding that they favor, I have not been influenced, partly because I have ridden with effective fairings for over 23 years now, and like the speed they give me. Let me tell of my latest acquisition. I purchased a recent Dahon Folder because it fits my Prius and allows for my 8 inch Newtonian telescope to come along on my road trips now that I am fully retired. Naturally this is all inside the car for economic, wind noise and pilfer-proofing reasons. At first I rode the Dahon as it was intended. Then I thought I'd do the Doug Milliken thing (Moulton with fairing) with it. I built a PETE head bubble blowing device, cobbled together  with a half round wastebasket attached to the front cargo boss of the Dahon and a body sock. This worked, sort of. But it was way too big, way too clumsy and I have never developed the ability to ride in a semi-!
</I>&gt;<i>   tuck that
</I>&gt;<i>    you racing types have spent years learning to endure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So back to the drawing boards (yes I STILL use one despite my computer skills) and a long desired conversion of the Dahon to a recumbent. It is still a work in progress, but I have made it workable so far. And the old Personal Peloton fairing I originally devised from a pair of Piper Cherokee Aircraft wheel pants has proven to be as aero-effective as it was when I had it on the Lightning P38. To retain the Dahon's folding capacity and its ability as an upright bike I used a Gates carbon fiber tandem timing belt to link the two separate crank/bottom bracket assemblies for oil-stainless fingers during conversion. The seat is from two different backpacking camp chairs and some minor structural additions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Limited to just the single Gates Belt length, the boom extension is not optimal as a recumbent for my leg length, and I don't anticipate any longer rides with this bike, but it seems about as useful in that configuration as some other manufactured recumbents I have tried over the years and has survived some bumpy roads I thought might be its undoing despite the fact that the welded M6 tapped boss provided by Dahon was only meant for a small basket as an attachment. I think that if I rode with clips, or had racer strong legs it might not hold up, but it did survive a 200M effort at the San Jose Velodrome early this year.
