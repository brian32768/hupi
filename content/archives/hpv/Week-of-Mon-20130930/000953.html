<PRE>I remain stubbornly recumbent. Yes I still have some upright bikes hanging in my garage that I occasionally get out, pump up and remind myself why I ride recumbent once again.

It isn't my nature to follow the latest trend, never has been. While recumbent riders are significantly in decline along with the style of riding that they favor, I have not been influenced, partly because I have ridden with effective fairings for over 23 years now, and like the speed they give me. Let me tell of my latest acquisition. I purchased a recent Dahon Folder because it fits my Prius and allows for my 8 inch Newtonian telescope to come along on my road trips now that I am fully retired. Naturally this is all inside the car for economic, wind noise and pilfer-proofing reasons. At first I rode the Dahon as it was intended. Then I thought I'd do the Doug Milliken thing (Moulton with fairing) with it. I built a PETE head bubble blowing device, cobbled together  with a half round wastebasket attached to the front cargo boss of the Dahon and a body sock. This worked, sort of. But it was way too big, way too clumsy and I have never developed the ability to ride in a semi-tuck that you racing types have spent years learning to endure. 

So back to the drawing boards (yes I STILL use one despite my computer skills) and a long desired conversion of the Dahon to a recumbent. It is still a work in progress, but I have made it workable so far. And the old Personal Peloton fairing I originally devised from a pair of Piper Cherokee Aircraft wheel pants has proven to be as aero-effective as it was when I had it on the Lightning P38. To retain the Dahon's folding capacity and its ability as an upright bike I used a Gates carbon fiber tandem timing belt to link the two separate crank/bottom bracket assemblies for oil-stainless fingers during conversion. The seat is from two different backpacking camp chairs and some minor structural additions.

Limited to just the single Gates Belt length, the boom extension is not optimal as a recumbent for my leg length, and I don't anticipate any longer rides with this bike, but it seems about as useful in that configuration as some other manufactured recumbents I have tried over the years and has survived some bumpy roads I thought might be its undoing despite the fact that the welded M6 tapped boss provided by Dahon was only meant for a small basket as an attachment. I think that if I rode with clips, or had racer strong legs it might not hold up, but it did survive a 200M effort at the San Jose Velodrome early this year.
