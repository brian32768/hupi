<PRE>Too bad you do not have a Prius V. All but LWB recumbents probably fit in
them.

</I>&gt;<i> It isn't my nature to follow the latest trend, never has been. While
</I>&gt;<i> recumbent riders are significantly in decline along with the style of
</I>&gt;<i> riding that they favor, I have not been influenced, partly because I have
</I>&gt;<i> ridden with effective fairings for over 23 years now, and like the speed
</I>&gt;<i> they give me. Let me tell of my latest acquisition. I purchased a recent
</I>&gt;<i> Dahon Folder because it fits my Prius and allows for my 8 inch Newtonian
</I>&gt;<i> telescope to come along on my road trips now that I am fully retired.
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally this is all inside the car for economic, wind noise and
</I>&gt;<i> pilfer-proofing reasons. At first I rode the Dahon as it was intended. Then
</I>&gt;<i> I thought I'd do the Doug Milliken thing (Moulton with fairing) with it. I
</I>&gt;<i> built a PETE head bubble blowing device, cobbled together  with a half
</I>&gt;<i> round wastebasket attached to the front cargo boss of the Dahon and a body
</I>&gt;<i> sock. This worked, sort of. But it was way too big, way too clumsy and I
</I>&gt;<i> have never developed the ability to ride in a semi-tuck that
</I>&gt;<i>   you racing types have spent years learning to endure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So back to the drawing boards (yes I STILL use one despite my computer
</I>&gt;<i> skills) and a long desired conversion of the Dahon to a recumbent. It is
</I>&gt;<i> still a work in progress, but I have made it workable so far. And the old
</I>&gt;<i> Personal Peloton fairing I originally devised from a pair of Piper Cherokee
</I>&gt;<i> Aircraft wheel pants has proven to be as aero-effective as it was when I
</I>&gt;<i> had it on the Lightning P38. To retain the Dahon's folding capacity and its
</I>&gt;<i> ability as an upright bike I used a Gates carbon fiber tandem timing belt
</I>&gt;<i> to link the two separate crank/bottom bracket assemblies for oil-stainless
</I>&gt;<i> fingers during conversion. The seat is from two different backpacking camp
</I>&gt;<i> chairs and some minor structural additions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Limited to just the single Gates Belt length, the boom extension is not
</I>&gt;<i> optimal as a recumbent for my leg length, and I don't anticipate any longer
</I>&gt;<i> rides with this bike, but it seems about as useful in that configuration as
</I>&gt;<i> some other manufactured recumbents I have tried over the years and has
</I>&gt;<i> survived some bumpy roads I thought might be its undoing despite the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that the welded M6 tapped boss provided by Dahon was only meant for a small
</I>&gt;<i> basket as an attachment. I think that if I rode with clips, or had racer
</I>&gt;<i> strong legs it might not hold up, but it did survive a 200M effort at the
</I>&gt;<i> San Jose Velodrome early this year.
