Message-ID: <9AA8091C4C8645F6BDC776F6CC5FD17C@dv500015bcb074>

Good morning,
I know that many of the available velomobiles have the drivetrain mounted inside a tunnel to make them weathertight.  Can anyone point me to drawings of any of them?  I'm (still) designing such a system for a 2-wheel VM.  I'm pretty sure the Cab-bike and Quest have such a setup, but don't know where to find drawings.  In particular I'm interested in the ones where the chainring is between the bearings instead of on the outside.
Thanks.

You might take a look at the Flevobike Greenmachine.  For example:

The Versatile also uses a two-chains-in-tunnels setup. One chain from
the chainring to the usual output side of the Speedhub, which is
mounted in the pivot point of the swingarm, and the second chain down
the swingarm to the rear wheel drive cog. The Speedhub is mounted to
the left side of the swingarm shell only.

Some pictures of this are in this PDF:
