Brian hasn't responded to my recent emails to him.

I am discontinuing bikelist.org and all of the HPV mailing lists will go away in a few weeks if he doesn't move them to a new service.  I'd like to avoid any service interruption to these lists.

Alex, I have been offline for 4 days taking care of family business out in
the hinterlands of Oregon.

Actually I am only the ancestral listmom here. I stepped out around the time
the HPVA coup took place.

I am not really a fan of Google or Yahoo groups so I won't suggest them. I
bet there is some other home that could be found for these lists.

Alex, thanks for your years of providing bikelist.org hosting service at no
charge. What happens to the domain name and all the other mailing lists? One
possibility would be to move mail hosting somewhere while keeping the name
so that it minimizes disruption.

Brian

(Coincidentally at the moment I volunteer with a group that calls itself
VHPA -- same letters, different order. Different cause too.)

Amen.

I'll offer one of my servers.  One of them is already supporting
several Mailman lists.  Let me know if you don't get any better
offers.

Dear Ph T and HPVers --

The IHPVA.org forums (and IHPVA.org site itself) need a lot more attention
and promotion. Without devotion and promotion, they won't ever take off. But
they still serve a different purpose than a mailing list.


> . bikelist.org was sponsored by www.hupi.org ?
>

No no no! Bikelist.org is a project of Alex Wetmore. Many thanks again to
Alex for stepping in when a new home for these lists was needed!

I dreamed up the individual hpv mailing lists on the sonoma.edu domain
around 1988 when most IHPVA people had no idea what an "Internet" was.
Later, the IHPVA.org domain name and sites were also created by me and then
later updated principally by Mark Newell until his passing and still
generally ignored by IHPVA organizers unless I said something there that
they did not like. :-)

My reference to HuPI in the footer of the hpv-* lists was a vote of support
for HuPI.org on my part. Alas, HuPI has not taken off (yet).

their ongoing project appears to have died in 2009
> http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm
>

Refer to the "about" page http://hupi.org/about.html
It is just doing what it was created to do.

HuPI is successfully performing its principal mission, which was ensuring
that the HP Journal could be distributed initially as a CD and since then,
online. It never would have shown up on IHPVA.org now or ever without the
persistence effort of HuPI.

IHPVA seems dead, but all I have to go on is ihpva.org and hpva.us. I
presume the HP Journal is dead too since the IHPVA.org archive ends with
issue 55 which dates to what, 2004?

The shared dream for HuPI is about having the breadth to cover any kind of
human power stuff from atlatls to cider presses... to (something starting
with 'z' goes here, please submit a paper :-) HuPI is inclusively about
human power in a world that desperately needs alternatives to fossil power.

To me, the current version of IHPVA is about going down a hill in Nevada
once a year in a human power "vehicle" that rode as a passenger hundreds of
miles to the event in a big fossil foolish vehicle.

All due respects to Sam and company, but IHPVA is as irrelevant to me as
NASCAR. All recent press releases are about Battle Mountain or going in
circles taped into a streamliner, and I just don't care about it any more.

The pettiness and factionalism that drove me away from IHPVA.org and
WHPVA.org also drove me out of HuPI.org for a breathing spell... maybe when
the mapping project I am working on for VHPA.org is done... but... lots of
other interests now.

Still and all -- the world event is in ITALY at MONZA this year!! I bet they
even have food I can eat there! Slow food for fast bicyclists?

Maybe I can be a hypocrite and load my little bike into a big airplane and
fly over there, and join hundreds of people who WILL show up under there own
power!

Still dreaming --

Brian

If you leave now maybe you could ride there in time? If you're going fast
enough you could flip the streamliner and surf across the wee bit of
sea...

......I agree with E assist. That's why I have built one of the lightest Velomobile with a ultra light (4.3 pound) E assist which I use for local alternate transportation. 

But I only got here because of all that I leaned over the years from the IHPVA.

I have had a Bionx system on my LEITRA for several years now.  It helps on hills and easies the strain on my knees at stops and starts.

My future plans include a velomobile with electric assist for steeper 
hills and stop and go urban riding.

I just wish it was lighter (motor and battery) and lower power.

I am /so/ cheesed off that this was announced after I'd already got a prior 
engagement for that week.  Doubly so since Amplifier (my current candidate 
for Best Band In Teh Wurldz) are playing their only London gig this year in 
the same week.  Someone doesn't like me.

To keep the bike a nice ride, adding in an assist without powering the chain, no batteries, my sketches have a tiny RC model style engine of 3-4 hp, the shaft driving a cylindrical torque-converter to step down the high rpm's with the outside of that the drive-wheel to the tire for the assist, behind the bb is possible on many bikes, the seat-stays aren't very strong for this. The torque-converter means it'd add to your pedaling as mentioned.
 
That'd do the hills & all, light & small, tiny tank but needs to be muffled well and I want it running biodiesel so it needs a soot removal system in the exhaust, the soot melts ice in the Arctic. If an engine was designed specifically for this would be best, just seems a best combo of least energy used, get up the hill with a load or when a headwind is blowing hard and not alter the bike at all.

We actually did get a number of articles by researchers these last 
years. Unfortunately none of them made it through the review process. 
One nearly made it but would have needed more work and was withdrawn. So 
I had to write the last article myself and I urge you to read it if you 
want to build a storm-proof bike shed. As I'm more into drystone walling 
than HPVs at the moment, it will get even more bizzare... So if you 
would prefer to read about things that move, please send articles! HPeJ 
isn't dead, just sleeping.

My wife had a Bionx fitted to her already slightly heavy recumbent and 
now enjoys cycling a lot more. I did shave off about a kg by removing 
the plastic battery case and putting the battery into a cardboard box in 
a pannier. What I like about the Bionx is the regenerative braking.

Incidently a new electric bike book is out; I can recommend it:

Darn, I expected better of people who publish a magazine electronically -
they don't seem to have an ebook version available.

I think you could get by with a lot less than 3 to 4 hp (approx. 2250 to 
3000W), considering a world class time trial rider puts out about 450 to 
500W during an hour run.  Or did you mean 0.3 to 0.4 hp?

A model engine is not good. Its designed for high rpm, small bearing surfaces, poor carburation, needs cooling, crazy fuels etc. I used a 21 cc weed wacker engine which has all you need (and cheap) and I cut excess weight off it - things like the pull starter. Added a cog belt gear reduction so I could use a decent size friction drive which worked real well even when wet and did not wear out the tire. But its lossy something like 40% efficient which is ok with a IC system because you have so much power. To climb a hill you need .1 hp from the rider and .2  to .3 hp from the assist. 
It was geared strictly for climbing where you need the help the most so it was used intermittently. 
I was able to travel 1300 miles on one gallon of gas. 
The whole system weighed 6 pounds including fuel. 

I did a lot of long distance (1000 + mile) self supported touring in mountain areas such as on the East coast and Sierras. 

What I learned from  the IC assist I applied to my present  E assist which weighs 4.4 pounds complete.

In this design 3hp was what I designed to, you may lose a full hp going up a hill with a load and a fluid drive, they aren't too great up hills that way, haven't done any math on this one but bet you can lose 30% as a worst-case. 
 
The trouble with the tiny engines is their high rpm's (many are 10k), a lower rpm tiny engine is more ideal to this purpose and could be designed, or maybe something is already out there. Designing to 1.5k/min is even hard, wheel rpms on a bike are pretty slow.
 
So a fluid drive solves the mismatch in rpms at the cost of heat from fluid friction in slip and cheap to make versus gearing, more expensive & efficient, don't think there are many other choices that are non-battery.

Right on John, agree there's not much interest or funding for hpv ideas ... 
 
While fractional hp's is all that's required, having more hp's for the fluid drive means it operates at a much better efficiency than full throttle so in this case having more is better, should actually help mileage, so, that's why I chose 3-hp's as a starting point.

Actually the book does cover a surprising range, but not "all" as John says, in
particular not his system. Quite a few commecially available low-power,
low-energy systems are described, and these tend to be geared toward low-speed,
low-range use, not the high-speed, long-range, intermittent use system. One 
system described ist the 1.9 kg Gruber assist for uprights, hidden in the seat 
tube, rumoured to be used by cheating racing cyclists...

3 hp (2.2 kW) is quite hefty. I guess you would need this for most fluid drives 
which are probably not very efficient. I think mechanical systems are more 
efficient. Matthias Wegman built bikes with the "Tetz-philosophy". He used the 
surface of the rear wheel as an extremely wide-range CVT, the motor with a 
friction drive being able tro travel from near the hub (high gear) to near the 
rim (low gear).

Clever PR.. but one needs a profoundly deaf audience for cheating with the Gruber ;-)

I'm assuming

1 We would like to avoid list interruption (e.g., to hpv at bikelist.org
  and hpv-forsale at bikelist.org)

Kinda following from that,

2 We would prefer to maintain the bikelist.org domain.

This may be my personal preference, but I also think it follows from #2,

3 We would prefer to continue list management with Mailman.

Please let me know if any of those is incorrect. Otherwise, how' bout we
start choosing a target for lists migration? E.g.,

My lists are managed by Mailman on a CentOS v5.5 platform.  One such
list is for RBENT (Recumbent Bike Enthusiasts of North Texas)
<http://www.bobcatos.com/mailman/listinfo/rbent>.  I can also provide
searchable archives, retroactive if I get an mbox of old stuff.

Also, I'm about to put a new server in a colo, and I might put it on
there.

I just want to be clear that this isn't an option.  The bikelist.org domain is much better known for the iBOB, Framebuilders, Touring, and Classic Rendevouz lists than the HPV lists.  I'm keeping it around as an archive and a pointer to where to find the new lists.

I'm happy to provide the same service for the HPV lists, but I'm not going to transfer the bikelist.org domain.

I think Brian Wilson has the list migration under control.  I'll let him announce his plans when he is ready.

Subject: [hpv] E-assist slightly off topic
Message-ID: <ba973.4a38c2a0.3a980ef7@aol.com>

With regard to velomobiles, I note that the German Wind Explorer team seems 
to have gained some recent publicity with an electric vehicle trip across 
southern Australia where they kept energy records and utilised wind assist 
when it was practicable. Their vehicle appeared to me to have been cobbled 
together from a pair of velomobiles. Side by side with a set of tubes down the 
middle for a wind turbine-on-a-pole charging apparatus and an inflatable 
surf-sailing device for when they were on the road. Vewy clever. 

They did not have pedals to use but I suspect wrangling that sail to keep 
it from tangling with the side of road protuberances used a modicum of sweaty 
human power along with the nightly ritual of assembling that turbine. They 
seem to have made about 32mph(52kph) average speed on the flats IIRC.

So... I did a little calculating. My ride across the U.S. also had wind 
assist. The airfoil shape of my modified F-40 allowed me to sail for miles and 
miles   some of those days at 20mph (32kph) sans pedaling while on the flat. 
  On most other flatland traveling (West to East) I benefited from wind 
assist at a lower level even if the road direction did not carry me at the 
optimum sailing angle. Per John Snyder's Land HPV Force and power 
calculator(thanks John), for a typical 11 mph relative wind of 230 degrees compass bearing 
to direction of travel, and assuming his calculations are appropriate for 
the shape of my bike as a functioning sail(a stretch,perhaps) I used less 
than half the energy that they did, but at lower speed as well. All 104 watts 
were coming from my legs, no motor or wind charging necessary. 

I never did more than 150 km in one day where they were able to go as much 
as 400 km in a day on their 8   KW/hr battery pack and claim an average of 
2KW/hr for 100 km. That performance is better than the automotive x-prize 
winner would do at the same speed: 2.3KW/hr but the x-prize vehicle would hold 
four and was half again as heavy. It was also much faster.

Message-ID: <c0f22.6a142933.3a9829b9@aol.com>

I did do an E-assist two years ago for the Portland OHPVA event. It proved 
to me that I was barking up the wrong tree. Some Points:

I wanted a simple addition without mechanical complications and had not had 
good luck using a tire drive system many years before which scrubbed too 
much rubber and used two big a lead acid battery. I was in danger of 
distorting my diamond frame had I hit a big enough pothole.

So I used a model aircraft electric motor, the biggest one I could find. 
With a 36v nominal(32V under load) driving a four bladed shrouded propellor 
mounted behind my shoulders in the space I usually have my tailcone fairing on 
my modified F-40. At full power this combination used 560 watts and 
generated enough thrust to propel me at about twenty miles per hour but would only 
accelerate me very slowly to about fifteen without pedalling. Quite 
inefficient.

More knowledgeable people there told me my problem was that the propellor 
and motor were designed to go 60 mph in the aircraft. I raced the twenty mile 
flat course at half power to get the most out of my two batteries which had 
to be switched out at half way. The average speed I maintained was not much 
better than the non- assisted speed I had done the day before for a ten 
mile race, but I could not have done twice the distance at those speeds without 
it.   I was able to do the front straight at 28mph without much trouble.

When I got back from that event I set to work on the inefficiencies. 
Finding a two bladed propellor of the same size, but optimised for a slower air 
velocity dropped my consumption down to 330 W for a little less static thrust, 
about 14.5N (3lb,4oz) I also abandoned the boundary air scheme of 
Goldschmied's for a more conventional ducted fan arrangement. I have yet to see a 
practical application of Goldschmied's work but his wind tunnel testing with a 
modified model of the Akron dirigible shape showed great promise.

For E-assist on my bike   the extra drag of the unpowered fan was not worth 
changing out the tailcone for a longer trip than one for which the 
batteries could provide continued assistance. My tailcone coast down tests suggested 
a new, longer tailcone was worth more to me than that strap on unit at a 
lot less weight.

Thank you for your delightful off-topics! I had the same experience using an air 
propeller. Unlike yours, mine was custom-made for a human powered boat (see 
http://umwelteinsatz.ch/theo/WM99boote/aeroboat.jpg for a picture of this during 
the 1999 World Championships in Interlaken, showing Sam Meyer on AeroBikeBoat on 
the Lake of Brienz). It was about 2.2 m diameter and had adjustable pitch. It 
worked quite well on the boat. I later fitted it to a geared down 250 W motor 
and tried to ski with it. Like you I found out that it would keep speeds but had 
very little acceleration. Of course the resistance of skis on snow is higher 
than with wheels on asphalt. Also I had the thing in front of me and had to hold 
it in my hands. I hadn't reckoned with the huge torque, which needed all my 
strength to hold (50 cm long board as mounting). Also, I didn't have my arms 
free to use skiing poles, so the propeller had to provide acceleration from 
rest, at which point the efficiency is lowest.

Cheers, Theo

The body is made from the mould of the DuoQuest (by velomobiel.nl). The Germans 'forgot' to mention that.

It would have been no problem to build in pedals as can been seen from the original vehicle.

Yes, the fluid drives are really lossy for continuous output engines, could be a hydrostatic drive that steps down a certain amount, more like a fixed-gear, using a torque-sensitive design seems useful as when you gain speed on the flats it'll give more roll-out as torque goes down instead of winding it up for more.
 
Anyway with the superlight ideas at ounces for the engine & tranny the choice is blow more fuel when you use it but it's relatively easy to make and it's superlight when you're not using it vs gearing where you'll way better mileage but at these rpm's how's durability on a bunch of tiny gears?
 
So, that tipped the scale on reliability and low-maintenence to a lossy fluid drive to a OTS model-shop engine where a small lathe & milling machine can do the fluid drive & shafting, mounts ... bet it can get to 4-oz, goal was 6-oz plus the alloy water-bottle fuel-tank ... includes a real muffler & exhaust system to put these on the street.
 
... zoooom zooooom !!!

Greetings --

This mailing list "hpv at bikelist.org" is moving to "hpv at hupi.org".

The move will probably commence on Monday or Tuesday, depending on how
busy we are. When Alex (at bikelist.org) is ready, he will turn off
the list at bikelist.org so no new messages will be accepted there
(this includes commands such as subscribe/unsubscribe requests). Alex
will then send the list data to me and I will install it and
reactivate the list at hupi.org.

We're using the same software at both servers so in theory this should
be a simple move.

You don't have to do anything -- except start using the new address
after the move.
I will send another message when the list is running at hupi.org.

Sorry, but if you're on more than one 'hpv' list you will be reading

Does anyone have a link to the report from Human Power Magazine on the
efficiency of a bicycle chain drive? I remember generalities from it
but no hard numbers, like the losses didn't change much until the
small cog was really small for the time, 11 and 12 teeth back when
most freewheels had 13 teeth on their smallest cog.
