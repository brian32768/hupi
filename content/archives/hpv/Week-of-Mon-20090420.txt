I rode this bike a little on Saturday (I am in Portland for the weekend):
http://www.joe-bike.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/joe-bike-both-racks.jpg

The frames are made by Flying Pigeon and the racks were made by Stites
Design (who many of us know as a builder of leaning trikes).  The
design is very similar to a Bakfiets.  The bike could have benefited
from a longer stem for me, the ride was very upright.  The stock stem is
short to work with the canopy on the cargo bike, but that isn't necessary
when running with a front platform.

The cargo area is shorter than a normal Bakfiets, but might be about
the same as the short model.

It handled nicely and felt pretty similar to a Bakfiets.  I didn't
carry any load, so I can't comment on how it feels with a load.  The
racks were well made, but I'm not sure how I feel about the double
decker setup.  The front brake wasn't very good, but it sounds like
they are going to switch to a disk brake on future models.

It's an interesting bike and the basic models are the cheapest Long
John or Box bike type bikes that I know of.

Although the rod brakes look VERY cool, it is good to see that Joe-Bike is replacing the brakes for the US market.  These bikes are infamous for their lack of stopping ability even in Beijing (a very dry, flat place).  

The bike frames will last forever, even under stresses that "normal" US riders would never dream of placing on a bike.  One example I have seen was a rider that had a refrigerator strapped on to the bike, which also had flat tires and a missing pedal block (but did have the pedal axle).
