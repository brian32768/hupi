The moment of angular inertia about the tire patch is smaller than for a tall conventional bike. 

How does the angular momentum of high recumbent compare to tall conventional or low recumbent?



Too lazy to look it up or do my own calculations, I am...

Yes, of course.  Thanks, Paul, for correcting my incorrect use of nomenclature.  

So the moment of inertia of a low bike will be lower than that of a high bike, proportional to the square of the height to a very rough first approximation.  So unstable states will deteriorate faster for a low bike than for a high bike, to a first approximation.

I have noticed this difference between my upright bike compared to my mid height Infinity LWB and now my semi low Challenge Hurricane.  I have time to correct my upright that isn't there in the mid height and even less time with the low recumbent.  Not having a high recumbent racer, I cannot compare, but I would expect them to feel more responsive and correctable.

I assume you want to compare moments of inertia, not angular momenta.  You 
are correct that the smaller the moment of inertia, about an axis that 
connects the contact points, the faster the object "falls" under the torque 
of gravity.
Specific comparisons depend on the details of the bike and rider 
combination, of course.  With the spongy rider constituting the majority of 
the mass, rider position makes a big difference.  Recumbents give somewhat 
less flexibility of position than uprights, so the common approximation of a 
rigid body works a little better for them than for uprights.
The Physics principle is that the moment of inertia you are looking for is 
the sum (or integral) of an infinite number of products.  The things you are 
adding up are each tiny bit of mass times the square of its distance from 
the axis referenced above.  Since the moment of inertia depends on how far 
the mass is from the axis _squared_, it is generally not sufficient to 
locate only the center of mass.  But, that will give you a very rough basis 
for comparison.  Even rougher, ignore the bike's mass and simply locate the 
center of mass of the rider (usually around the navel).  The higher that is 
above the ground, the larger the relevant moment of inertia.

In my experience, this is a big disadvantage of recumbents. In addition 
to the higher natural frequency of the inverted pendulum, the recumbent 
makes it difficult for the rider to maneuver his body for control, as is 
done on an upright bike. The inability to stand on the pedals for hill 
climbing is also frustrating for me. (OK, maybe I don't have my 
"recumbent legs.") Putting this all together, I find hill-climbing on a 
recumbent relatively difficult, and sometimes dangerous due to poor 
steering control. I'm sure this is more of a problem for me on 
Pittsburgh hills, than to flat-landers.

A couple ideas on how to mitigate this problem:
* A "landing gear" that is deployed for static stability during 
low-speed riding. This would be a great help for starting on steep 
hills. This has some problems with side slopes, and sharing the load 
with the driving wheel. Also, it can be pretty bulky and heavy.
* An assist motor, so you can maintain reasonable speed on hills. This 
could also help with starts, as you could keep feet down for balance 
while starting.
* A gyro wheel to help stabilize the bike (e.g. 
http://www.thegyrobike.com/). This works largely by generating steering 
inputs to maintain stability. I have played with this concept on a 
recumbent, and it seems to help. It does add weight and complexity, and 
requires power to run the gyro.

No calculations here; just a little personal experience from riding a lot of
big hills in the last 10 years or so on recumbent. It's mostly a skill
thing, even more than a fitness thing. I know Pittsburgh hills can be very
steep. Thing one is to have some nice low gears so you can maintain a
reasonable cadence while climbing. My lowest gear is 30 front/34 rear and I
do use it, especially late in a long ride or up a very long or steep hill.
Thing two is the skills in balancing. It comes with time and focus. Practice
riding 2" from the edge of a painted road line. You have to overcome the
natural tendency of the pedaling to steer the bike since the pedals are
often forward of the front wheel. Also practice riding very slowly and
maintaining a straight line. I can now ride 4 mph in a very straight line up
a big hill if need be, and 3 mph if I concentrate. So for me, the recumbent
is no issue regarding stability. 

Is climbing slower on a recumbent? That has got to be the biggest debate
around with no clear answers. As for standing up, if you watch the pros on
long climbs, they stay seated. Standing generates a lot of power but at a
cost. If you develop a good ability to spin (i.e. fast spin instead of
pushing hard--work your way to up to being comfortable at a sustained 90-100
rpm) then climbing should be much easier. But it still seems slower. I have
two pet theories on this that might both have elements of truth:

a. Recumbents have aerodynamic advantages on flats and downhills so that
people I can ride with easily on the flats will usually be able to outclimb
me, thus it seems like the recumbent is slower on hills. If I ride with
riders that are too slow for me on the flats, I outclimb them just fine. 

b. It has to do with the angle of the hill. Going up a hill changes the
angle of the riders legs relative to "flat" ground. So it makes it harder to
pedal. This is not very logical and this pains me, being an engineer by
training and career! Picture an extreme case--a bike where your back is
horizontal and the pedals are directly above your hips. Seems like that
would be harder to ride, since the pushing is all straight UP! So when the
bike turns up hill there is a little of this effect. Or this is all in my
head :) Sometimes I think that maybe if my seat raised an amount equal to
the rise in the road, it would be easier to climb.

Barclay changed the subject, but I'll bite on the old hill climbing debate.
I think his suggestions for making climbing easier on a recumbent are very 
good, generally more practical than Ben Brown's (no offense).  Weight is 
your enemy here, so anything that adds weight (landing gear, gyros,...) is a 
step in the wrong direction.  Unless that direction is toward designing an 
automobile.

The "big debate" he refers to does have a clear answer, at least one I can 
defend with basic physics.  I think the question may be simply stated: does 
either platform, upright bike or recumbent bike, have an _intrinsic_ 
advantage when climbing hills.  If we control for all other variables, in 
particular total mass and rider's power output capability, then the answer 
is no.  The rate of climb is directly proportional to Power divided by Mass. 
This is easier to see if you restrict the comparison to long, steady, slow 
climbs, so that transient effects of engaging other muscle groups or 
different starting speeds become negligible.  If we consider lower 
aerodynamic drag as intrinsic to the recumbent, then the recumbent has an 
advantage even in climbing, but that advantage becomes vanishingly small at 
low speeds.

It is generally agreed that a reasonably fit rider can use all of his 
cardio-pulmonary capacity with his legs, so that max sustainable power is 
not significantly affected by standing on the pedals or otherwise utilizing 
the different positions offered by an upright.  A well-designed recumbent 
does not restrict breathing or add more friction of any kind.  The 
biomechanical stuff can get complicated, but the human body is extremely 
adaptable.  So if we allow for sufficient training, I would contend that 
there is no significant difference in the efficiency of delivering the 
rider's maximum power to the pedals, that is intrinsic to the recumbent 
position vs. the upright.

One could argue that greater mass IS intrinsic to the recumbent compared to 
the upright.  If so, then the advantage goes to the upright in proportion to 
the mass ratio and how steep the hill is.  It remains generally true that 
for the same cost/quality level, an upright bike will tend to weigh less 
than a recumbent.  I think this contributes to the common perception, along 
with a possible sampling bias in the masses and fitness levels of the 
respective groups of actual riders.

Barclay's comments in his point a. are right on, and also a factor in group 
rides on flat terrain when there is wind.  On a headwind leg, I'm cruising 
with the bike club guys, no worries.  Comes a long tailwind stretch, and I'm 
dropped like a physics class that is no longer required.  Seems ironic, but 
it makes perfect sense when you think about it.

I don't think there is any relevant objective reality in Barclay's point b.

I have noticed both a. and b. I've done steep climbs on a wide range  
of recumbent geometries and the ones that seem easiest to pedal on  
steep climbs are those with relatively upright seats and low bottom  
brackets while the very laid back high bottom bracket bikes feel like  
I'm working harder for a given heart rate. This could be in part  
because the more horizontal the body is the lower the heart rate is  
due to the way blood flow works in relation to gravity. I have one  
laid back bike with the bottom bracket much higher than the seat  
where it feels like I'm working very hard to maintain 140 beats per  
minute while another with a more upright seat and low bottom bracket  
it is fairly easy to maintain 150 beats per minute. I'd like to get a  
watt meter so I can see how the power output compares for various  
positions for a given heart rate.

Hi Paul et al,

Yes, that's the mystery indeed. From a theoretical physics point of view,
there should be no difference in climbing, since we can neglect air
resistance, and the weight difference in bikes is easily overcome by rider
weight differences or even a bottle or two of water! To really get good
data, we'd need to control for rider fitness and weight, and there just
isn't enough data. 

What puzzles me, is ME. That is, anecdotal and experiential "evidence" that
seems to contradict or at least mitigate the obvious physics. I used to
train as much as many ultra distance riders, was about equivalent in
size/weight, total rolling weight about the same, easy to stay with them on
flats with no wind, but I would immediately fall off the back when we hit
even a modest hill, and I'd have to work like a DOG to stay with them. 

I intend no offense here either, but many recumbent riders just don't train
very hard, are overweight, etc. so they don't really provide good data here.
It's easy to dismiss their slow climbing as just a lower fitness or training
level (and more power to them for getting out and riding no matter their
level of course!). I would ask people on the list: compared to your riding
buddies, who ride about the same amount as you, are about the same age and
general fitness level (height/weight proportion, etc.) how do you climb
compared to them? If recumbents were no different than uprights, there would
be no difference. And I would find myself in the middle of the packs I ride
with. But I don't. You may say, well, you're just the weakest rider in the
pack, and perhaps so, but this is 10 years of experience riding with racing
clubs and fast sport clubs, large century rides, etc. where I'm normally the
only recumbent rider on the ride out of dozens of others. 

To the scientists on the list, I would put the challenge: come up with a
theory to explain the anecdotal experiences people keep sharing. WHY DO
recumbent have the reputation for climbing slowly. Your theory doesn't
explain this. Note for example, that no one is claiming that steel bikes
climb slower than carbon--there's no anecdotal evidence for this, so no one
need put forward theories. But there is for the recumbent thing. 

There's a principle in the scientific method that I'm sure you're familiar
with... that you can't use the data from which a theory was derived, as
evidence for the theory's validity. So one can't claim that because they did
this or that calculation or lab test and from that they concluded that X is
so, that this proves that X is so. One would need to test the theory
independently with new data. Where is that data that shows that recumbents
climb as well as uprights, controlling for weight? 

Hopefully this isn't road that's been traveled before in this discussion!

I really would like to get to the bottom of this climbing difference. Claims
that there is no difference don't seem convincing to my experience and the
anecdotal evidence. 

It's a nice day here in coastal NC... I'm going to go ride! 

- Barclay

PS Nice to hear from you Zach... interesting thoughts regarding human
anatomy as making a difference in the position. You know how I like to put
an air cushion thermarest seat on my Lightning? I was thinking if one could
have a thicker one that could be pumped up in prep for a climb. Hmm can
someone do the trig to figure out how much a seat needs to be raised to make
up for a 6% grade, given an average x-seam length?

That may be, but using different muscle groups may allow the athlete
to more efficiently convert their VO2 into pedal power.

I was just reading this article and figured it might has some relevance to
this topic. Specifically the first part on Brain Activity and how it
prioritises different muscles due to propulsion vs staying upright(gravity).

Anywho, if you have some time give it a read.

>the recumbent makes it difficult for the rider to maneuver his body for control, as is 
done on an upright bike. 
.....I have a very low short wheel base recumbent. The seat bottom is 7 inches above the ground. 
To me that low weight is an big advantage particularly in quickness in handling. I ride with up rights and when they see sand on a corner they shout out SAND and quickly slow down. I continue my speed, and with micro inputs ot the direct steering handlebars I can throw my bike hard into the corner before the sand, straighten it out during the sand, and throw it hard to finish the corner, and leave all the up rights far behind. You cant do all that quick handing with a high CG. Moving the body is too slow. Too much mass. 


And no wonder the up rights are more cautious.  If you fall from that height your going to hurt your self. Hands arms shoulders and worse your head and face are very vulnerable. On a low bike if you do go down the seat hits first and then you get some road rash on a thigh. You definitely don't go flying over the handlebars. 

On rough road down hills I can more often pick my path . And I go much faster down hills than the up rights because part of that is the much better aero. I also have fatter tires which handle the bumps much better. 

Yes I'm a bit slower up hills but I'm a lot older than most I ride with (77 vs 50s).   I generally gain so much flying down grades (light pedaling or coasting) and in using less energy on the flats that I get to the hills before them. 

My bike is closer to 30 pounds with fenders, luggage rack and small panniers. I use the bike as local alternate transportation. Their bikes are 17 to 20 ponds and can only carry a hankie. Put decent wheels and tires, fenders, luggage rack and panniers on a up right and they aren't so fast up hills.

No doubt about that. I would never try to draw conclusions from anyone who
was new to the sport or the type of bike. That's why data is so hard to come
by! Nevertheless, some recumbent bikes (like the Lightning I ride now) have
very much the same body angles as uprights so it's hard to see how different
muscles are being used. The only difference I see, and this could be
significant, is the direction the muscle is exerting relative to the
direction of gravity. Should this make a difference?

 

One could imagine a controlled experiment using identical electric motors
propelling various bikes, equalized for weight and turning the pedals with
the same cadence and force over various terrain. The race is on. 

 

PhD project anyone?

Actually, it does. Since the gauntlet has been thrown at scientists (I'm a Physics and Math guy) I'll take it up. My theory is simple: training. I'm pretty good uphill on a recumbent for a guy in my age+weight category (old heavyweight boxer) because I've been riding recumbent since 1991 -- but I've been riding a hunker-bike since 1952. That's a big difference. Here's an anecdotal experience to contemplate: my youngest (fifty-something) brother told me he'd rather have a baseball-bat than a samaurai-sword in a fight. Clearly the sword is a vastly superior weapon, so why the choice of bat? Simple: training. He played baseball for many years, and spent many hundreds of hours in the batting cage, so he's good with a bat. With a sword, zero hours training -- so of course he's better with the artefact with which he's had more training. It's that simple.

1.) In theory since we are supposed to be pedaling circles I would think
this wouldn't make a difference.

2.) Also the theory about higher and lower bottom brackets between Uprights
and Recumbents and blood flow doesn't seem logical either to me.
It would seem to me the heart has to do MORE work on a upright even vs a
high BB lowracer. On an upright your feet are 3-4 feet below your heart and
on the lowracer its pretty close to level.

Just some thoughts, I'm no expert :)

Cheers,
Paul

Hi Cornel,

Well, it's possible. We probably need more data, since I'm at least one
counter-example. Yes I rode an upright bike from about age 10 to age 19,
then no riding at all until age 40 when I started riding on a recumbent.
I've ridden only recumbent since then, and have put on many times the
mileage of my teenage experience. Anyway, I have a feeling that recent
experience should count for more than decades-old experience. Let your
brother train in Kendo for a year, and I bet he'll prefer the sword over the
bat. Seems also that we have some evidence that there is pretty good
transfer of training between different types of bicycles. Those who set
speed records on recumbent usually have long experience riding uprights,
racing history, lots of training, etc. and a relatively short exposure to
the recumbent. Was it Sam Wittingham who said in an interview that he keeps
sharp and fast by being a Cat 2 racer as he's setting 60+ mph records on an
enclosed low racer style recumbent?

Part of my anecdotal annoyance with this issue is that I also find myself
being challenged at hill climbing by even far inferior cyclists. Let's say
I'm riding with a casual rider, one who has never trained hard, never ridden
more than say 40 mi at a time, rides regularly but not a high volume, etc.
He (or even she!) can often make me work quite hard to keep up on a modest
hill, while I can handily beat them by hours on a 50 mile ride or a century.
They are uncomfortable above 16 mph on flats, while I can easily maintain
20-22 for hours. But up a hill we suddenly seem much, much closer in
ability. In the cases I have in mind, I can beat them up the hill but I have
to multiply my effort by several times to do it. Yes, they work harder on
the hill too, but it feels like they are going from effort level 5 to 7 and
I'm going from level say 3 to level 9. This happens so often it's shocking.
Does anyone else notice this?

One more little story. I used to ride every week with the San Diego Bicycle
Club, the big racing club in that town. I was the only recumbent. It was a
40 mile, high intensity ride, same course every week. They called it a race
without a fee. After a few mile warm up, the first hill comes and everyone
attacks. For a while I would get so soundly dropped on this hill that I'd
never see most of the riders again. Later I learned to follow a different
strategy. On the flat road approaching this hill, I would ride off the front
of the pack, putting as much lead on them as I could in the say, 1 mile
stretch (I'd often tell the pack leaders that I'd see them on the hill so
they wouldn't take this as an attack and follow me). Then I'd hit the hill
alone and give it all I had, sometimes reaching within a beat or so of my
MAX heart rate. The fastest riders in the group would catch me just as I
reached the top of the hill and I'd be fine riding with them for the rest of
the ride. Having that extra 20 or 30 seconds on the hill made that much
difference in the rest of the ride. It SEEMED to me that I had to get that
extra time to make up for my inherently slower bike. 

One more data point: Pete Penseyres, a well known record-setting recumbent
rider/racer and also all-time average speed record holder in the Race Across
America (on an upright) once told me after riding with me quite a bit on his
weekly group ride, that if I got on an upright I'd be able to beat about
half of the present group up hills. Just his opinion of course, but
definitely an experienced source. 

Anyone else having things like this happen?

Interesting conversation!

Barclay

OK, I'll bite on the hill-climbing issue, too. Here's my opinion: the upper
body engagement that upright road bikers employ when hill-climbing is
advantageous.  The shortest way up a hill is a straight line, but the
fastest way up a hill is a sinusoidal path.  Watch any good video footage of
the mountain sections of the Tour de France and you'll see what I mean.

My wife and I ride the MBB-FWD Cruzbike.  Prior to 2007, we had zero bicycle
racing experience.  We noticed on hilly rides like Bon Ton Roulet in NY,
Bike Virginia, and the CNC (Ride Across NC), we were relatively fast going
up hills and we were working our upper body much like the road bike riders.
 There are a lot of recumbents on these rides, and we have NEVER been passed
by a recumbent going up a hill.  We also passed most of the road bikes on
the hills.  I weigh close to 200 lbs.  On the climbs, I would pass just
about any road bike rider of a similar weight to me.  Other recumbent riders
were dubious of our reports of hill climbing ability.  They said "that's
just marketing hype, prove it by entering a race."   So we entered the
12-hour UMCA race in hilly Saratoga County, NY this past July.  I finished
5th overall among the men and Maria, my wife, finished first among the
women.  Not only that, Maria rode the course faster than any woman on a road
bike has EVER ridden the course, setting a recumbent record that surpassed
the road bike course record.

Not content to stop there, she set the women's UMCA recumbent 12-hour world
record (pending certification), surpassing the 240 mile record set by Nancy
Raposo on a road bike.  Raposo was in her early 30's and an established
distance bicycling champion when she set the 12-hour record.  Maria is a 46
year-old housewife who clicked her feet into her first racing pedals about
one year ago.  How can you explain this?  Maria should get a lot of credit
for a hard effort, but the Cruzbike Silvio gives her the aero advantage of a
recumbent and the whole body power generation of a road bike.  It's an
unbeatable combination.  Someday I hope this technology catches the
attention of a few serious cyclists who will take the time to learn the
technique; then the records will really start falling.

A couple of our fastest local riders in all conditions ride a  
lowracer. John Foltz and Chris ?. They can still drop nearly all  
uprighters, especially of similar fitness, even on uphills of all but  
steepest/longest grades.

I do note that they seem SLIGHTLY slower on the ups, but that doesn't  
hold them back much -- they can still push open a gap if need be. I  
suppose at that point they might be exerting MORE than the  
uprighters. But maybe not.

Often the speeds are such that they're still getting good aero perks.

I used to ride a lowracer with them. I think that excellent uphill  
performance came to all of us only after *a COUPLE YEARS of hard  
work*. The uphills did seem to take a *much SHARPER effort* than with  
an upright. Punchier, more forceful. It was a distinctly different  
feel than upright climbing and took serious longterm adaptation.

However, our lowracers back then were fairly heavy. (I've gone to  
more group-riding dynamics -- rotating pacelines, etc. -- and sold my  
HPV. I couldn't maintain the fairing in my limited space/time -- it  
was getting scrunched in my small garage, etc. I resented the 30+ lb  
bike, too.) The other 2 guys now ride ultralight carbon and seem very  
pleased with the results in all conditions. They may no longer need  
so much of the "sharp" efforts to put the uphill hurt on uprights.

My main point was the 2-year sharp effort adaption to superior uphill  
skills. Any testing/comparison would need to include that for fairness.

Possibly this is an "overhead" requirement that should be noted as  
part of the "cost" of 'benting. Such a learning (adapting) curve  
might be rejected in many activities. Well, chess is known to take a  
few years -- I suppose lots of highly technical activities are known  
to take a long time. Motor-racing, for instance.

That sounds like the perfect strategy for racing on a recumbent. It's clear why the recumbent is faster on the level -- simple aerodynamics -- and I think the reason why it's slower uphill is also simple, but I agree that we need more data. I can't provide any from my own experience because I was never fast uphill on any bike.

..........Its more than body angle. When I got my P-38, my first recumbent, I had a hard time climbing any hill in comparison to the up right I had.   It took me a couple of seasons to get really good. I hear this from many new Bent riders. 

Now most of my bikes have so called high BBs and when on occasions I do ride the P-38 with its relatively low BB I don't do well on it at all. Trying to ride say a Tour Easy which has a very low BB is a disaster for me. 

Therefore all of my bikes have the same seat to BB height. 

Sam Whittingham years ago learned to train on a bike that has the identical BB to seat height as the Varna.  Same with Greg Kolodziejzyk and his record breaking vehicles. 

Its pretty clear and well known that BB height does make a difference and requires re-training for different heights.  

Therefore I still claim that the process of every day walking and climbing stairs helps maintain the up right riders muscle tone more than the recumbent position. 

If we look at climbing power difference between a light weight up right and a heavier recumbent we also can see another difference. 

Lets say the up right conditions are  CdA 2.9. Cr .005, rider weight 170 lbs,  bike 17 lbs, drive train eff of 97%.   To climb a 6% grade at 6 mph requires 159 watts. 

For the recumbent the CdA is 2.4 Crr .0055, same rider weight of 170 lbs, bike 30 lbs, drive train eff 94% (intermediate idler). The climb power is 170  watts. 11 additional watts doesn't sound like a lot. To get the power down to the same as the up right the speed would have to drop to 5.6 mph which is about the speed difference between these two vehicles. If the recumbent tries to accelerate say 0.1 mph per second the power jumps to 182 watts. 

If we look at a long term human power capability curves we see a fairly steep fall off vs power increase. 10 or 20 additional watts doesn't sound like a lot but when your heart rate is high, your breathing hard and your legs are staring to burn that 10 to 20 watts hurts. 
Tie in a drop off in muscle tone during the week and we don't do well climbing. 

I ride a VM all winter on almost a daily bases. I love riding with the up rights who rode only sporadically during the winter. Needless to say I have no problems staying ahead of most of them.

I tend to agree with Cornell and I'll add that by the time most riders
switch to recumbents their fitness has eroded due various issues that
stimulated their interest in recumbents. When they don't magically
recover their speed in all conditions, they blame the bike when the
engine is the cause.  Few bike shops are staffed with competent
recumbent riders so they accept the feedback from their new recumbent
customers  at face value and pass it on.

I was an OK climber when I started riding recumbents. OK meaning I
could climb every hill but definitely a middle of the pack rider.
After a lengthy acclimatization and learning phase  which I'm
embarrassed to admit took 2 years, I developed more confidence with
climbing. Since converting to recumbents in 95, I've done harder rides
than I ever did as a DF rider. I even became a bit cocky while doing
hilly club rides  and discovering that sometimes I made it to the top
first but never last.   These days, at 60, I don't dominate climbs as
much but I sure enjoy passing the uninformed DF riders  who say
recumbents can't climb.

I'm pretty good uphill on a recumbent for a guy in my age+weight category (old heavyweight boxer) because I've been riding recumbent since 1991 -- but I've been riding a hunker-bike since 1952. That's a big difference. Here's an anecdotal experience to contemplate: my youngest (fifty-something) brother told me he'd rather have a baseball-bat than a samaurai-sword in a fight. Clearly the sword is a vastly superior weapon, so why the choice of bat? Simple: training. He played baseball for many years, and spent many hundreds of hours in the batting cage, so he's good with a bat. With a sword, zero hours training -- so of course he's better with the artefact with which he's had more training. It's that simple.

Other than the typo of recumbent Crr .0055 (s/b 0.055 -- one reason why I exhort my students to include the leading zero in the "ones" position) I dispute two items: 
(1) (recumbent CdA)/(upright CdA) = 2.4/2.9 = 0.83 
considering the HUGE downhill speed advantage of a recumbent over an upright, I would expect this ratio to be no greater than 0.67 
(2) "drive train eff 94%" 
compared with the "drive train eff of 97%" for uprights, this means the intermediate idler converts 3% of its throughput to heat, which is unlikely. 1% or less is much more plausible, my estimate being 0.5% .

I've been riding since I don't know when.  My first bike was so big I could only ride it because it was a ladies design with a dropped top tube. If I hung from the bars like a gibbon, I could just reach the pedals.

I raced ABL in high school, badly, but I loved the training rides. I've toured most of the state of AZ and big parts of Nor Cal. I built my current double diamond frame as a practice run, hoping someday to build my own Greenspeed -- not going to happen! I can't see well enough to get the brass fill right and its whole heck of allot of work filing bad joints.
  
I have always been a climber but it sound like some of you would drop me on the flats in a heart beat. My wife married me for my legs, etc. My inseam is 35", and I am 'slight' in the upper body. I have a hard time keeping my laptop case strap on my shoulder.

When I was finishing my graduate degree in Nutrition and Biochemistry, I got to spend some time with an uncle who had trained horses all of his life.  He "placed" with  one in the Kentucky Derby.  I thought I knew something about actin and myosin and fast twitch vs. slow, so I was shocked to learn that horses are not trained the way we train human athletes.  They can run or not.  It all about genetics.

The math and physics guy got the sinusoidal path right.  Maybe he can comment on lever length and mechanical advantage as well. I've ridin enough bents to know that it is tough for me to get my weight (gravity), my abdominals, my forearms and my legs working they way they work on an old school racer.

It sounds like the Cruz bike lady is built for bent speed. My guess is that it's a special breed that climbs well on a recumbent.  We don't pull beer wagons with Arabians and we don't race flat track with Clydesdales.
