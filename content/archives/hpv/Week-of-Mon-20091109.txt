Actually it would have been the same as having two drives, 97% for the
first one and 97% of what's left for the second. and by my calculator
that comes to 0.9409 or 94%.

I agree that having a low center gravity helps a bike handle quicker.  That is the flip side of falling quickly.  But my reaction times have never been that fast, John, and they aren't getting any faster as I get into my late 60s.  When I hear "sand" I start looking for another route!

I brought up the topic because I have been asked many times over the years whether a recumbent is hard to ride.  When I was younger I answered, "not really"; but as I get older and my bikes get lower, I answer, "yes a little harder" due to the feeling of instability or twitchiness.  I am still wondering whether a high recumbent would feel more stable, but I cannot afford to fall from that height any more.

Some suggested a trike for ultimate stability, but the aerodynamic, rolling resistance, and weight advantages keep me wanting to be on two wheels; though I can see a velomobile a few years in my future.  

But looking at the big picture, for long distance commutes of the low carbon future, perhaps on dedicated routes designed for high speed biking, the streamlined low recumbent bicycle clearly offers the highest speeds with the least effort.  But the instability problem is a real issue, I think.

>the recumbent makes it difficult for the rider to maneuver his body for control, as is 
done on an upright bike. 
.....I have a very low short wheel base recumbent. The seat bottom is 7 inches above the ground. 
To me that low weight is an big advantage particularly in quickness in handling. I ride with up rights and when they see sand on a corner they shout out SAND and quickly slow down. I continue my speed, and with micro inputs ot the direct steering handlebars I can throw my bike hard into the corner before the sand, straighten it out during the sand, and throw it hard to finish the corner, and leave all the up rights far behind. You cant do all that quick handing with a high CG. Moving the body is too slow. Too much mass. 


And no wonder the up rights are more cautious.  If you fall from that height your going to hurt your self. Hands arms shoulders and worse your head and face are very vulnerable. On a low bike if you do go down the seat hits first and then you get some road rash on a thigh. You definitely don't go flying over the handlebars. 

On rough road down hills I can more often pick my path . And I go much faster down hills than the up rights because part of that is the much better aero. I also have fatter tires which handle the bumps much better. 

Yes I'm a bit slower up hills but I'm a lot older than most I ride with (77 vs 50s).   I generally gain so much flying down grades (light pedaling or coasting) and in using less energy on the flats that I get to the hills before them. 

My bike is closer to 30 pounds with fenders, luggage rack and small panniers. I use the bike as local alternate transportation. Their bikes are 17 to 20 ponds and can only carry a hankie. Put decent wheels and tires, fenders, luggage rack and panniers on a up right and they aren't so fast up hills.

http://Kreuzotter.de, an online bike data calculator, shows that a  
highracer has a CdA of .21 (meters squared), not a whole lot better  
than the .23 of a common upright tri-bike with aerobars and aero-wheels.

Now, a lowracer has a CdA of .17, which is darn low, but perhaps not  
as safe for open-road riding.

OK, a road bike in the drops is .38 while a touring SWB or Easy Racer  
is .25-.27. -- So that's a sizeable gap.

But it seems likely that a lot of 'bents have only modestly better  
aero properties as comparable uprights -- but the 'bents often weigh  
a lot more, negating a good bit of the aero gain.

Quest velomobile is about .06 -- very low -- but it's probably quite  
heavy.

Anyway, here's a link to a blog with lots of links to online

....I agree. 

>(1) (recumbent CdA)/(upright CdA) = 2.4/2.9 = 0.83 
considering the HUGE downhill speed advantage of a recumbent over an upright, I would expect this ratio to be no greater than 0.67 
.........Reasonable comments. These are generally accepted CdA numbers by many HPV researchers. I have made coast down measurements that confirm those values. My little FWD is around 2.3. There are a few very low recumbents that may be a bit faster and quite a few slower than my bike. That is why I chose 2.4. Some up rights may be slightly less than 2.9 specially if the riders is down on the drops. But this would be unlikely when climbing. 

To get down to a ratio of 0.67 that means the bent has to be around 2 - only the most radical are are down that low. 

Plugging the same numbers into TCoastF1 spreadsheet  for a 6 % down grade the terminal speed for the up-right would be 37 mph and the recumbent 42. That's pretty huge. Even a 1 or 2 mph difference in speed appears to be huge, particularly if is over many seconds.  

>compared with the "drive train eff of 97%" for uprights, this means the intermediate idler converts 3% of its throughput to heat, which is unlikely. 1% or less is much more plausible, my estimate being 0.5% . 
....again that's a typical value that is used by many recumbent designers. If the angle the chain over the idler is very small then yes  that idler efficiency will be higher. Bachetta (and other like designs) particularly made sure that angle is minimal. And with its short boom and large diameter stiff frame they climb well. P-38s also climb well with it short boom and stiff space frame and very small chain angle over an idler. 

But say on a FWD with a better than 90 degree change of chain line the loss is probably well into the 4% regon. 
The 97% on  the up right is only if the chain line is lined up with the chain ring and cog. Any crossover and that efficiency drops. 

Someone in the WISIL group made this measurement some years ago and noted how quickly the efficiency drops vs chain angle. 

Another issue is frame flex. As I point out with the Bachetta and P-38 both have stiff frames. But many bents have rather long booms. That flex can also be power robbing. That's where the diamond frame is far superior. 
Its too bad the human factors are so poor.

Hello Stuart and Ben;

Wonderful comments. 

>and they aren't getting any faster as I get into my late 60s. 
.....I too know the feeling. I'm 77 and its definitely getting  a bit slower. But by "exercising" that part of the brain I'm doing ok (for my age). Practice  Practice Practice helps. And Ego. Doing whatever it takes to go faster is driven by ego. 

>whether a recumbent is hard to ride. 
....I ysay yes. If you balance a broom on your hand the weight is up high, and the hand can easily move quick enough. But as that weight is lowered the hand has to become quicker and quicker. Anticipation of where it might go  helps. But the body is amazing. It can learn to do all this. 

Tour Easys are easy to ride because of the long wheel base. But I cant stand to ride them. They feel like I'm steering a tugboat. I like the feeling when the vehicle is an extension of my body. My first bent was a used P-38. The original rider couldn't handle it. 

> trike for ultimate stability, but the aerodynamic, rolling resistance, and weight advantages keep me wanting to be on two wheels;
....That's exactly what I thought (actually Rolling resistance is the same). I said when I get old I get a trike. But 4 years ago I wanted to investigate a VM. And now its my all time favorite alternate transportation vehicle. So I guess that makes me officially old. 

But seriously running erands and such is SOOOOOOO much more comfortable on a trike. You come to a intersection and look for traffic. If something is coming you calmly put on the brakes. On take off there is none of that wiggling while you struggle for balance. You spend more time checking the intersection than worrying about stopping or starting. 

If I ride only the trike for a month then when I do get on a bike (my low FWD is really quick) I wobble just a bit until my brain becomes used to spending energy on balance. It takes quite a few miles for it to adjust. 

>the streamlined low recumbent bicycle clearly offers the highest speeds with the least effort. 
.....I did many many years of streamlining. Thrilling. I also used it for alternate transportation particularly in the winter. But it's a pain in the ass. Talk about tension coming into a intersection !!!!!. Getting at least one foot unclipped (hopefully the correct one), then holding it up with the feet in a narrow stance near the center of the vehicle (particularly in a cross wind), then taking off, WHEW.  None of this in a VM,. Plus there is more room in a VM. 

Streamliners are great for cross country. Nothing can keep up. On occasions I go out and kick the asses of the young guys (ego ego ego). Hey I'm using my brains not my long gone brawn. 
I also did a lot of long distance touring in a F-40 - a very practical vehicle. 
But it gave little or no protection when going down. I lost some precious skin. That's what drove me to hard shell (noisy, expensive materials, throw away materials, and labor intensive and toxic). Then I discovered Zote foam and haven't looked back. 

>But the instability problem is a real issue, I think. 
.....Im assuming your talking about cross winds. The F-40 was fine, The Spandex caved in softening the side push. And say a wind hit the vehicle from the left.  It automatically pushes the wheels to the right making the vehicle lean into the wind. If you relax and don't try to stop this action the wander is fairly  small. But if you fight it the wander is much greater. Having direct steering helps a lot. You can put in micro adjustments with your fingers minimizing the wander. Again the body learns how to react. 
A streamliner is like flying a plane. Its not for every one, whereas a VM is.  

I get a little wander in the VM too. At really high speed I would rather be in a streamliner. If you go down your falling from a low position. In a VM there is a possibility of turning over and that means doing a high sider. Ugly. So i definitely don't go as fast down a grade in a VM. 

Fun topic.

That makes a lot of sense if drivetrain loss is completely from the idler, but that doesn't seem reasonable because fixies and other bikes without idlers don't have 100% efficient drivetrains. It's been a long time since I've looked at the data, but 98% occurs to me as the high figure for chain-drive without idler, meaning that the idler is wasting an additional 1% -- so a second idler would waste 1% of the remaining 97%, leaving about 96% -- which is about what I would expect.

Some Z frame bikes like the MetaPhysic triangulate the boom receiver.
I used to think the 2" non adjustable steel boom on the Virginia was
stiff. The aluminum MetaPhysic adjustable boom is much stiffer.

I think another efficiency issue with recumbents is seat movement in
adjustable seats.  I've had 5/8" Rans struts bow and spring back with
a Euromesh seat.  New 3/4" struts don't bow but there is still
detectable  movement at  the grenade pins and strut mounting bolts.

    Oh Fred, Fred, Fred.....  It's not lack of triangulation on your  
'bents that makes the frames flex.  And, it's not flexible seat stays  
either.  Just admit the fact that you are an "animal" with cast iron

Has anyone proven that frame flex = energy loss?

Cites, links?

"Bicycle Quarterly" magazine has done research on this (along with  
tire efficiency) and it was recently discussed on the iBOB list. The  
general idea is that a flexy frame seems to be faster and that the  
energy of flexing isn't lost, that steel is a great spring. It was  
noted that race bikes tend to be flexier than touring bikes to begin  
with and that top racers have used race bikes that were flexier than  
most (Sean Kelly, Fignon). Publisher Jan Heine has mentioned that  
there doesn't seem to be research showing that a flexy frame is  
slower. However, it's likely that all flex isn't desireable, but what  
and where hasn't been sorted out yet. "BQ" promotes the idea that a  
certain type of flexy frame is desirable because it "planes" -- a  
skilled rider uses a cadence that works with the flex to give a ride  
that's superior in several ways.

"BQ" has lamented that relevant, real-world, real-road bike research  
isn't often done or supported by the bike industry. However, it seems  
to me that university engineering students/profs would be interested  
in such testing and have facilities, etc.

I don't think it will help the rolling resistance because it will skew the tires.

I have never been a good climber, and am only marginally better now because 
my HPV has gotten me to ride much more often than I did in my DF riding 
days. Now certain conventions of description have arisen since the beginning of 
the modern movement. 

HPV's are inclusive of all bikes, trikes and quads, but the term velomobile 
has come to mean only a trike. I would argue that my modifications to my 
Lightning P-38 over almost 20 years of riding have made it a velomobile for my 
purposes. I have ridden it almost exclusively with a fairing of some sort 
from the time that I built it up as a frame kit in 1990. From the beginning I 
have only used clip-in shoes for the rare occasions when I attend a formal 
racing event, there for I have not had the inconvenience of low speed 
balance that riding with clips entails. I started with Winwood insteps when I had 
Look type pedals and now with speedplays I have built my own "shoe pockets" 
for riding with street shoes.

My climbing is thus less stressfull as I can drop a foot for a few moments 
of rest and breath recovery, just like I do at every major stop sign and 
traffic light( "California rolling stops" at the rest). What this has meant is 
that I have found that faired riding on two wheels is practical with some 
compromises to maximum speed for the vehicle/rider combo. An open bottom to 
the shell is one of those compromises. A slightly less efficient pedal 
connection is another, but I still manage to drop most of the challengers I see 
coming in my rear view mirror on the flats and can sometimes even stay ahead of 
them on the 3% hill I have getting back home. I couldn't do that without 
the fairing.

I have the greatest respect for what John Tetz has been able to do building 
some of the best homebuilt, practical low streamlined bikes   and   trikes 
I have seen, but his need for speed is greater than mine. I do applaud him 
for his abilities   given his ten years seniority. I hope I will be as active 
when I get there. I will stick to my faired P-38 for now because it keeps 
me at a height equal to the eye level of the cars I encounter and people in 
cars seldom fail to notice that big yellow fairing nose.

 The inconvenience of fairing entry through my door flaps is about the same 
or less, in my mind, as getting down into a velomobile trike.   I can be on 
my feet at an intersection in an instant for increased visibility, and with 
the strap across the seatback in one hand, and the handlebar neck in the 
the other, I can revise my direction, even reverse it with out fully 
dismounting. The single track of the bicycle I find superior for narrow shouldered 
roadways and pothole dodging.

 I fact, now when I ride a DF I notice right away the gyroscopic forces on 
the large front wheel that keep me from the line I would take if on my 
Lightning.   I also find that the twitchiness inherent in the P-38's adherence to 
racing bike steering parameters is nicely damped by that fairing's wind 
loading.   I have had but a handfull of spills in the nearly twenty years   
I've owned it, and only obtained minor road rash on two of those occasions, one 
because I was in racing clips.
 The fairing material, except for the nose is made from a rugged HD 
polyethylene single sheet, not coroplast, and has come through those spills with 
only minor damage. I used the same set of side doors for more than ten years, 
before rebuilding them last year. The old ones, though ugly, are still 
servicably free of rips and tears. The panniers I made ten years ago from the 
same material can still be distorted to hold the contents of three grocery bags 
and return to their aero shape once I unload them.

Thank you Jeff, those figures put the ratio of recumbent-CdA to roadbike-CdA where I expected it to be, between 0.66 and 0.71

I found a Kreuzotter online calculator here:

Thank you Jeff, those figures put the ratio of recumbent-CdA to roadbike-CdA where I expected it to be, between 0.66 and 0.71 

.......Those numbers seemed high  to me so I dug up the plot done by Doug Malewicki  back in 1983 for the 2nd Human Powered Vehicle Scientific Symposium. And I saw I was using the incorrect value of the racer in the crouched position as a typical up right CdA which is closer to 2.9 sq ft, 0.27 sqm.

Given that the Malewicki data represents older bikes I can see that the CdAs can be a bit lower. 
The TE is a older design so a more average bent might be 2.5 to 2.7 sqft, 0.24 sqm. The contemporary up rights may be in the 4 sq ft range, 0.37 sqm. 
So the ratio that  Cornel is using looks to be correct. 

What I like about this HPV community is your constantly being checked by keen observers. 
Thanks.

....Paul, Thanks for the compliments.  I wonder if we could call this a need for efficiency rather than speed. 
My average cruising speeds in the VM for instance is around 18 mph.   It's the lower rider effort that intrigues me.
