is mostly about US randonneurs, PBP, US brevets, and other things with which you're probably familiar. Still, it's well done, and I did not know

<A HREF="http://www.npr.org/2013/06/29/195873620/randonneurs-are-in-it-for-the-ride-not-the-race">http://www.npr.org/2013/06/29/195873620/randonneurs-are-in-it-for-the-ride-not-the-race</A>
&gt;<i> At the turn of the 20th century there were riders from two camps in cycling culture. The French camp was led by a healthy-living guru nicknamed V&#233;locio
</I>
nom de plume of Paul de Vivie (more below)

&gt;<i> who touted the benefits of long-distance rides, fresh air and vegetarianism. In Italy, a style of group riding called Audax &#8212; Latin for audacious &#8212; became popular and was later imported to France by Henri Desgrange.
</I>
who also started the Tour de France (more below)

&gt;<i> Both styles attracted amateur cyclists, cyclo-tourists, as they were called, who did not get along with professional racers. [Racing was a working-class sport &#8212; prize money was a way out of the coal mines or factories.]
</I>
&gt;<i> &quot;There was a lot of animosity in France, actually, between the tourists and the racers,&quot; Heine explains. &quot;Because the tourists said, 'We are going in the mountains, and we are a participatory sport.' &quot; Participatory meaning that women could ride alongside men &#8212; and people could ride basically whatever they wanted. This drove innovations in bicycle technology that today are widespread: If you've ever ridden a bike with a derailleur, thank the randonneurs.
</I>
de Vivie punctured fixie foolishness over a century ago!

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Vivie#Campaign_for_multiple_gears">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Vivie#Campaign_for_multiple_gears</A>
&gt;<i> The Touring Club de France organised a challenge in 1902 in which a professional, Edouard Fischer, rode 200 km of hills without gears against a female rider, Marthe Hesse, riding a Gauloise with a three-speed derailleur. Hesse won. She &quot;never set foot to the ground over the entire course&quot;, one paper reported. Desgrange, though, wrote:
</I>
&gt;<i> &quot;I applaud this test, but I still feel that variable gears are only for people over 45. Isn't it better to triumph by the strength of your muscles than by the artifice of a derailleur? We are getting soft. Come on fellows. Let's say that the test was a fine demonstration - for our grandparents! As for me, give me a fixed gear!&quot;
</I>
and he could also do &quot;tour porn&quot;:

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Vivie#Writing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Vivie#Writing</A>
&gt;<i> After a long day on my bicycle, I feel refreshed, cleansed, purified. I feel that I have established contact with my environment and that I am at peace. On days like that I am permeated with a profound gratitude for my bicycle. Even if I did not enjoy riding, I would still do it for my peace of mind. What a wonderful tonic to be exposed to bright sunshine, drenching rain, choking dust, dripping fog, rigid air, punishing winds! I will never forget the day I climbed the Puy Mary.
</I>

&gt;<i> There were two of us on a fine day in May. We started in the sunshine and stripped to the waist. Halfway, clouds enveloped us and the temperature tumbled. Gradually it got colder and wetter, but we did not notice it. In fact, it heightened our pleasure. We did not bother to put on our jackets or our capes, and we arrived at the little hotel at the top with rivulets of rain and sweat running down our sides. I tingled from top to bottom.
