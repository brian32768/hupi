</I>&gt;<i> is mostly about US randonneurs, PBP, US brevets, and other things with
</I>&gt;<i> which you're probably familiar. Still, it's well done, and I did not know
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.npr.org/2013/06/29/195873620/randonneurs-are-in-it-for-the-ride-not-the-race">http://www.npr.org/2013/06/29/195873620/randonneurs-are-in-it-for-the-ride-not-the-race</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At the turn of the 20th century there were riders from two camps in
</I>&gt;<i> cycling culture. The French camp was led by a healthy-living guru nicknamed
</I>&gt;<i> V&#233;locio
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> nom de plume of Paul de Vivie (more below)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who touted the benefits of long-distance rides, fresh air and
</I>&gt;<i> vegetarianism. In Italy, a style of group riding called Audax &#8212; Latin for
</I>&gt;<i> audacious &#8212; became popular and was later imported to France by Henri
</I>&gt;<i> Desgrange.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> who also started the Tour de France (more below)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Both styles attracted amateur cyclists, cyclo-tourists, as they were
</I>&gt;<i> called, who did not get along with professional racers. [Racing was a
</I>&gt;<i> working-class sport &#8212; prize money was a way out of the coal mines or
</I>&gt;<i> factories.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;There was a lot of animosity in France, actually, between the tourists
</I>&gt;<i> and the racers,&quot; Heine explains. &quot;Because the tourists said, 'We are going
</I>&gt;<i> in the mountains, and we are a participatory sport.' &quot; Participatory
</I>&gt;<i> meaning that women could ride alongside men &#8212; and people could ride
</I>&gt;<i> basically whatever they wanted. This drove innovations in bicycle
</I>&gt;<i> technology that today are widespread: If you've ever ridden a bike with a
</I>&gt;<i> derailleur, thank the randonneurs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> de Vivie punctured fixie foolishness over a century ago!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Vivie#Campaign_for_multiple_gears">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Vivie#Campaign_for_multiple_gears</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Touring Club de France organised a challenge in 1902 in which a
</I>&gt;<i> professional, Edouard Fischer, rode 200 km of hills without gears against a
</I>&gt;<i> female rider, Marthe Hesse, riding a Gauloise with a three-speed
</I>&gt;<i> derailleur. Hesse won. She &quot;never set foot to the ground over the entire
</I>&gt;<i> course&quot;, one paper reported. Desgrange, though, wrote:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I applaud this test, but I still feel that variable gears are only for
</I>&gt;<i> people over 45. Isn't it better to triumph by the strength of your muscles
</I>&gt;<i> than by the artifice of a derailleur? We are getting soft. Come on fellows.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say that the test was a fine demonstration - for our grandparents! As
</I>&gt;<i> for me, give me a fixed gear!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and he could also do &quot;tour porn&quot;:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After a long day on my bicycle, I feel refreshed, cleansed, purified. I
</I>&gt;<i> feel that I have established contact with my environment and that I am at
</I>&gt;<i> peace. On days like that I am permeated with a profound gratitude for my
</I>&gt;<i> bicycle. Even if I did not enjoy riding, I would still do it for my peace
</I>&gt;<i> of mind. What a wonderful tonic to be exposed to bright sunshine, drenching
</I>&gt;<i> rain, choking dust, dripping fog, rigid air, punishing winds! I will never
</I>&gt;<i> forget the day I climbed the Puy Mary.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There were two of us on a fine day in May. We started in the sunshine
</I>&gt;<i> and stripped to the waist. Halfway, clouds enveloped us and the temperature
</I>&gt;<i> tumbled. Gradually it got colder and wetter, but we did not notice it. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact, it heightened our pleasure. We did not bother to put on our jackets
</I>&gt;<i> or our capes, and we arrived at the little hotel at the top with rivulets
</I>&gt;<i> of rain and sweat running down our sides. I tingled from top to bottom.

When I heard the news that a Chinese firm had bought the world's largest
pork producer I was sure that China had finally come clean about buying the
US Congress.
