Here are excerpts from two different studies on the subject of 
intermittent compared to continuous exercise and amount of energy 
generated (work performed). These two works are representative only. The 
subject periodically emerges in various biology and medical journals.

"A practical conclusion shown by the results of the present study is 
that if the aim is to keep the physiological cost of exercise to a 
minimum, a given amount of work is better performed continuously at an 
low power output. If the aim is to stress adaptive mechanisms then 
intermittent exercise is preferable. In fact intermittent exercise in 
the form of interval training is widely used in athletics..."

"We can use endurance curves to make predictions about continuous 
locomotor performance. To maximize total work output (or total distance 
traveled) before exhaustion during continuous locomotion, exercise 
should be carried out at a low power output (e.g., at speeds/power 
outputs to the left of the endurance curves in Fig. 2). However, to 
maximize total work output (or distance traveled) in a given amount of 
time, exercise should be carried out at the maximum work rate (or speed) 
that can be sustained for that time period (i.e., a point on the 
endurance curve; Fig. 2). These predictions assume that work is 
performed continuously. If the work is performed intermittently, then 
predictions should address the possible advantages of recovery from 
prior activity and the potential trade-off between recovery time and 
power output."

John Snyder;

Excellent articles on long and short term power. 
It verifies my use of long term Human Power Capability plots I have used in my articles. 

I was quite interested in the loss of efficiency at higher power intervals. 

The thing that I wonder in the Human Power article is the .6 horse power (447 watts) at 60 seconds and 10 seconds of recovery. That seems to be way way beyond my capabilities.   At 150 watts its starting to feel uncomfortable. 

They didn't talk about the subjects inherent abilities in the article but mentioned a family member could do this for 1.5 hours !!!!!

I havn't seen the HP article yet, but edited a similar one in 2003:

see page 21 HP54: http://www.ihpva.org/HParchive/PDF/hp54-2003.pdf

The point was that one pedaller could spend a minute or so cranking up 
the flywheel, which could then operate at five times the average 
pedalling power for 15 seconds, e.g. to operate machinery which a single 
person wouldn't be able to power otherwise. This would apply to certain 
electrical tools as well, but I can't see the benefit of a "large" 
flywheel when charging batteries at a constant rate. There is of course 
the benefit from a "small" flywheel, because pedalling at constant 
torque is more difficult than pedalling at constant speed - rather like 
cycling fast is "easier" than exerting the same power cycling steep 
uphill (apart from the cooling of course).

However this still leaves a discrepancy. Human Power eJournal was also 
offered this article, but we returned it, as the previous one had taken 
Dave Wilson and me years to edit. There was a great deal of information, 
but we couldn't understand much of it and left this out, so in the end 
only three pages were left. I can imagine that there might be similar 
issues in the present article.

Howdy John Tetz,

Here's a earthquake shaker of a new/old thought, power endurance is 
influenced by both mental and physical state!

Science Daily provides an excellent read.

Mental Fatigue Can Affect Physical Endurance

ScienceDaily (Feb. 26, 2009) ? When participants performed a mentally 
fatiguing task prior to a difficult exercise test, they reached 
exhaustion more quickly than when they did the same exercise when 
mentally rested, a new study finds.

The study also found that mental fatigue did not cause the heart or 
muscles to perform any differently. Instead, our ?perceived effort? 
determines when we reach exhaustion. The researchers said the next step 
is to look at the brain to find out exactly why people with mental 
fatigue perceive exercise to be more difficult.

Samuele M. Marcora, Walter Staiano and Victoria Manning of Bangor 
University, Wales, the United Kingdom, did the study, ?Mental fatigue 
impairs physical performance in humans.? The study will appear in the 
March print edition of the Journal of Applied Physiology. The American 
Physiological Society published the study.

The study

The 16 participants rode a stationary bicycle to exhaustion under two 
conditions: once when they were mentally fatigued and once when they 
were mentally rested. The trials took place in the laboratory on 
different days. The participants got the same amount of sleep, drank the 
same amount and had the same meal before each of the sessions.

The mental fatigue sessions began with a challenging 90-minute mental 
task that required close attention, memory, quick reaction and an 
ability to inhibit a response. After undergoing this session, 
participants reported being tired and lacking energy. The control 
session consisted of watching neutral documentaries for 90 minutes and 
was not mentally fatiguing.

After each of the 90-minute sessions ? mentally fatiguing or 
non-fatiguing ? the participants did an intense bout of exercise on a 
stationary bicycle. They rode until exhaustion, defined as the point 
when they could not maintain a cadence of at least 60 revolutions per 
minute for more than five seconds.

Throughout both exercise sessions, the researchers tracked a variety of 
physiological measures, such as oxygen consumption, heart rate, cardiac 
output, blood pressure, ventilation, and blood lactate levels. The 
participants completed surveys to measure their motivation and perceived 
effort. The researchers offered monetary prizes for the best performance 
on the exercise and mental tasks as a way to keep motivation high.

Results

The participants stopped exercising 15% earlier, on average, when they 
were mentally fatigued.

The participants stopped at the same perceived effort level in both the 
fatigued and non-fatigued trial. However, mentally fatigued participants 
started at a higher level of perceived effort and reached the endpoint 
sooner.

The cardio-respiratory and musculo-energetic measurements did not vary 
between the two trials when compared at specific points in time. 
However, because the non-fatigued trials went longer, heart rate and 
blood lactate levels were higher at the end of those trials.

Motivation was the same in both trials and was not a factor.

The researchers speculate that the perception of effort occurs in the 
brain. Dr. Marcora said his team is considering two possibilities: 
mental fatigue lowers the brain?s inhibition against quitting, or 
mentally fatigue affects dopamine, a brain chemical that plays a role in 
motivation and effort.

One interesting note is that demanding mental tasks activate the 
anterior cingulate cortex of the brain. Previous research has shown that 
rats with a lesion in the anterior cingulate cortex would not work as 
hard for a reward compared to rats with no lesion. This area of the 
brain may be where perception of effort originates, Dr. Marcora said.

Applying the results

This research could provide a way to study chronic fatigue syndrome, Dr. 
Marcora said. People with chronic fatigue report they lack energy and 
experience ?brain fog,? just like the mentally fatigued participants in 
this study. In addition, as in this study, people with chronic fatigue 
perceive exercise to be more difficult despite physiological responses 
considered normal during exercise.

The research model may also be helpful for military personnel. They do 
physically demanding tasks after long period of vigilance. Vigilance 
produces mental fatigue.

Finally, the study suggests that people doing high intensity training, 
such as competitive athletes, should do their training while mentally 
rested. However, people who exercise after work should continue doing 
so, even if mentally fatigued. Most people work out at a moderate 
intensity, which still gives plenty of physiological and psychological 
benefit, including relief from stress and improved mental performance.

....I read recently that under high mental stress the brain consumes around 30% of the bodies energy. 
So maybe that helps explain why the mentally stressed subjects were physically worn out earlier. They  actually used more of the bodies resources. It wasn't just a perceived  effect.

This issue had a long list of people that are supposed to do a peer review.  However this article and the aircraft one seem to have some issues.  

For the flywheel article there is no mention made of the inefficiencies of accelerating the flywheel.  Humans waste a lot of energy accelerating from zero speed.  

The aircraft article seems to throw several issues out the window.  There is no consideration of stability, control moments or structure design, to name a few.  

I know we haven't had an issue for a long time but...

That's an interesting take, that mental stress can serve as an energy 
expenditure. Stress can influence many different aspects of the brain 
and body such as increased heart and respiration rates.  This link goes 
to an abstract
( http://www.springerlink.com/content/98243380047r070k/ ) about a sports 
medicine study of chess players. Chess for gosh sakes is a physical 
sport! Who'd-of-thunk? As you suggest, difficult mental tasks can 
require an increased expenditure of metabolites (energy).

Getting back to the intermittent verse continuous pedaling matter 
related to operation of a flywheel. There is a mental condition we often 
recognize as NBS (New Bicycle Syndrome. NBS refers that odd phenomena 
whereby a new bike, new gadget or technique is faster and easier to use 
than whatever it replaces. Another description of the phenomena is the 
"power of expectations." Israel Urieli applied the term "a priori" in 
his paper in the 4th Velomobile Seminar, page 218. Recall, Izzy had been 
writing about validating the power and endurance curves in field 
conditions, and acknowledged that when the rider hit the wall (e.g., 
cycled long enough to be unable to walk) could have been  _in part_ 
having known before hand an expected distance.
