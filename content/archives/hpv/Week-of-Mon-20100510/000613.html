solar electric quad...

(scroll about 2/3 of the way down)

One of the Pacific Cycles 2Riders that he has uses 18&quot; wheels and he's 
looking for good rims for it to build suitable motor wheels.  The best 
we can locate (sort of locate) is the Zacplus by Weinmann, which is 
offered in an 18&quot; model but seems unavailable in the USA.

If anyone knows of a source for this incredibly odd rim, please let me 
know.  List members in Europe might be especially helpful here.  If 
anyone knows a helpful person in China who could look in that market, 
that would be a plus.
