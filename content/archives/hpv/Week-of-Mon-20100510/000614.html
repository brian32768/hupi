<PRE>I have one (probably) complete and another, partial, Ballistic 
suspension fork, of the type supplied on Vision 'bents in the late 90's. 
  I'm cleaning up the garage and I'll entertain any reasonable offer for 
these.  Some spare parts are available as well.  These are for 406mm 
front wheels and the steerer tubes are threaded.  The forks use 
elastomers and springs.

The forks are clean and unused, mostly kept for spare parts.  They've 
just sat in the garage for about a decade.

I'd prefer that they be used to spread Sweetness and Light, but in the 
end I'm not all that picky who gets them.
