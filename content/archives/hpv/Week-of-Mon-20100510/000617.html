Seems to be a company in Quebec that distributes them. Maybe they have  
rims:

Alex DV 15 and DA 16 are listed as 18&quot; but Sheldon (RIP) lists three  
different 18&quot; rims, and a 17 in among them. Wonder which one it is?

387 mm     18 x 1-3/8
381 mm      18 x 1-1/2
  369 mm     17 x 1 1/4
  355 mm     18 x 1.5- x 2.125

Click on specialty rims.

I think Birdy folders use 18&quot; rims. Maybe these guys would know:
