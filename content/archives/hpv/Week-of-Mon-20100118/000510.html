<PRE>Good morning,
I'm not sure if anyone cares, but I came across this news article about a gas-powered 2-wheel Quest Velomobile - apparently unrelated to the one we know about on this list.

<A HREF="http://www.fasterandfaster.net/2010/01/quest-velomobile-honda-anf125i.html">http://www.fasterandfaster.net/2010/01/quest-velomobile-honda-anf125i.html</A>

Not sure if the builder got the door-opening idea from the Aeolus (where is that now btw?).  In any case it's a beautifully finished machine, very functional and fuel-efficient for single-rider trips in more kinds of weather than an unfaired motorcycle (colder weather mostly, still dodgy on wet or icy roads).  It's based on a Honday ANF125i motorcycle, but the rider sits low enough that the side-profile would be manageable in most wind and gust conditons.

The article also refers to earlier streamlined motorcycles, and their ban in the late 50's because brakes and tires of the day couldn't handle the necessarily higher braking and cornering loads.  I'd guess new tires, brakes and regenerative braking would mitigate or eliminate those problems today.  (He then dashes of to Sketchup his latest inspired idea...)

Nick
