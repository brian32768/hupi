where do they post when there will be "fun Days" or recumbent rides at
the velodrome.  I live about 2 miels away and i never hear about them
until after people post pictures:(

Hi Michael,

just send an email to Carole Leone  - traslo @ fix.net asking to be 
added to her mailing list.

The Hellyer Velodrome event is usually held around the last weekend in 
May, depending on track availability.

This is the Demo   I did for those at this strictly Human Power Event of 
the drive I built for the Portland OHPV ePower event. I started out to just do 
some boundary layer control using the fan, but when I tried to improve the 
thrust to make me a bit more competitive I ended up with what you see in 
Bill's pics. The theory is based on the work of Fabio Goldschmied at NACA using 
an annular slot to pull the turbulent boundary layer in and redirect it out 
the rear thus adding "negative drag"(pressure thrust) in place of some of 
the form drag of a streamlined body. 

Since this only works to the extent of the existing drag, and I wanted a 
bit more boost, I began to cut the venturi tube down to get more thrust. I 
found that I still had flow into the slot as well as the more direct flow 
through a pair of NACA ducts and other openings leading to the fan. The static 
jet stream measures 35MPH(56KPH) at full thrust, but for the ePower event I 
dropped this down to about 24mph to get more time out of my batteries.
 I found that this strategy worked better than I expected. At speed the 
system seems to use less energy and the improvement it gives to my aerodynamics 
lets me go faster than the bike will without it. Bill told me that he 
sensed a slight headwind on the front straight at Portland International Raceway, 
yet I felt I could produce more speed at this part of the course. Someone 
else there might let me know if it has some downslope in that direction, 
otherwise I was getting aerodynamic improvement of one sort or the other.
 My bike sails quite well in a quartering crosswind and the filled in air 
provided by the fan could have acted somewhat like a virtual tailcone 
extension. As I had both battery and leg power left at the end of the race I 
'goosed' the throttle at the end of it.

Yeah, me too.

A little scroogling shows this is apparently an annual thing at the
beginning of June and is sometimes announced on hpva lists and at the
recumbents.com calendar

http://www.recumbents.com/WISIL/calendar.asp?ViewCal=View%20Calendar

I guess I'll put a reminder to myself to look for announcements in May 2010

Best Regards.

There it is then, my efficiency at 15mph is only about 25% unless it gets 
better with speed. I think that is the case. Cornel, how is that 100W   speed 
dependent? Is it based on my theoretical CdA matching the mass of the 
volume air moved aside for that velocity?
 I read that the Gossamer Albatross needed 11lbs of thrust to go 12mph 
while using much of it for lift and pushing that great wing through the air. 
Curiously, you arrived at my steady state speed of 15mph without pedalling 
while doing figure 8s in the parking lot at full thrust. 
 I need a propeller better optomised for for my best speeds. the one I used 
is made for a model airplane that goes up to sixty mph. I'd be happy to 
peak out in the middle of that range.

Hi Paul,

I'm Scott McElhiney... at Portland on Saturday afternoon you strapped 
that contraption to my GTO trike and let me buzz around the infield a 
bit.  I was wondering how the E-assist races went on Monday.  How many 
miles did you end up doing? 

For everyone else... when strapped to my trike, it didn't make enough 
power to really get me rolling, but as soon as I pushed the pedals over 
once, it just sort of floated along gathering speed slowly.  I didn't 
pedal at all as I wanted to see if it was really pushing me along.  I 
slowly picked up speed even as cornering and changing directions.  I'd 
have been curious to see how fast it would have eventually have taken me 
on a flat straight track.  It may have been acting a bit as a tailbox 
even on my trike by sucking in that turbulent air behind the seat area 
and thrusting it out.  Pretty interesting concept, although I don't 
think it could be as efficient as something mechanically driving the wheels.

Also found this calendar which would appear to be the authoritative
calendar for the Hellyer Velodrome

And yes, before anyone else corrects me, it was in May this year.

Hello Michael , Tony and the HPV Bikelist:

I'm the main organizer of the San Jose Fun Day.  Next year will be our 
15th year!   Here's the answers to some of your questions.

1)  The event is always some time between mid-May and late June.   There 
are several factors involved in figuring out which date:
     a)  when the velodrome is available for us to use;
     b)   when the ASME collegiate HPV race is.  George and I mentor the 
Cal Poly ASME HPV team and we always go to that competition, which is 
held in various places sometime in late April to early May.    We have 
to have a couple of weekends between that race and ours for us and the 
Cal Poly team to recuperate. 
c)   When Mother's Day, Father's Day and Cal Poly graduation are.  I 
won't do a race on Mother's Day weekend or Cal Poly graduation weekend.  
The saturday before Father's Day is a possibility.
d)  it can't be Memorial Day weekend because the Portland HPV races are 
always that weekend.

I try to pin down the date with the velodrome association in February 
and begin letting people know and posting it on calendars by mid-March.

2)  Race advertising.   I have a long e-mail mailing list that I send 
the announcements to, and I've put both your names and e-mails on it 
now.   I also have it posted on the Recumbents.com calendar and the 
velodrome puts in on their calendar.    I used to post it on the 
IHPVA/HPVA website but last time I tried, the calendar part wasn't 
operational.  I also used to post it on the old hpv bulletin board, but 
gave up on it when we were not getting any messages from that site.  I 
don't know if we got bucked off the site at some time or if it went 
dormant for awhile.   Now that it seems to be back in operation (or we 
were put back on) I'll be posting information on next year's event 
sometime next March.   Every year I vow to put up a website about the 
event, but things keep getting in the way of learning to do web pages, 
like helping build Primal 1, and getting ready to help build Primal 2 
this summer.  Oh yeah, and work too.

I'll be posting the final results this week as an Excel spreadsheet and 
I'll see if the hpv bike list will  allow that as an attachment.

3)  History. We started putting on this event 14 years ago as a fun 
thing to do with the Cal Poly HPV team.  At the ASME collegiate races 
only a few members of the team get to actually ride in the competition.  
We wanted an event where all the team members could ride as much as 
possible.   Word went out and it has just kept going.   There are a few 
of us who have been to just about every one of them.   A lot of people 
hear about it from a friend, come to watch the first year, and come back 
to race the next year.  The racing is competitive, but we don't 
emphasize who won as much as who is having the most fun.

See you next year!
Carole Leone

Expressing the net thrust as a function F(v) of speed, 
then the propulsive power is P = vF(v) 
 
Condidering the small size of your 60mph propeller, I would expect "P" (hence efficiency) to increase with speed, but there are a half-dozen confounding variables that make any such prediction nothing more than a 
guess -- although a larger propeller and cowl, both optimised for lower-speed operation, would certainly increase efficiency.

A few weeks ago someone posted a series of photos showing typical Dutch bikes and riders along with some written narration. 

I cant find that Email.

Could it have been something along the lines of this?

The whole site is about photos of typical (mostly Danish, though) riders on
their bikes. There was a link to it on this list recently, where the cycle
chic had been to Amsterdam, but I'm not sure it's what you meant?

.......This is similar but the one I saw  an American narrated the photos of a intersection in Amsterdam. Poor narration but good photos. . He showed the types of bikes, how casually they road and carried passengers, and showed the kinds of clothing they wore. 

The reason I am interested is recently the local bike club has asked me to write a series of articles about using a bike for local alternate transportation. 
I want to show how what kinds of bike that Europeans use and how they ride them. 
This is to inspire these bike club members to get then off their ultra lightweight stripped down bikes (toys) and get a bike with fat tires, fenders, luggage rack, panniers and lights.
