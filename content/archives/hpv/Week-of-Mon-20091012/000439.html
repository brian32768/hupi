&gt;<i> I'd love to see some real-world testing. Within the Schwalbe line,
</I>&gt;<i> there's 20&quot; and 700C tires in 28mm (Durano), 40mm (Marathon), and
</I>&gt;<i> 50mm and 60mm (Big Apple) widths.
</I>
There are actually a wide range of widths within some of those. 700C
Marathons come in a range of sizes from 25mm to 42mm or so. But it's
worth noting that they optimise the compounds for each size so you
won't get identical-except-size tyres even so. Still worth the
experiment IMO.

What you can do with the exact same tyre is use varying rim widths.
I've worked with someone who was convinced that very wide rims with
consequent flattening of the profile reduced rolling resistance, so
he ran 40mm or wider rims with the narrowest tyres that would fit
them. I think it would be worth trying at least a couple of different
rims with one tyre if you can - and now that 29&quot; MTB is getting
popular you should be able to get 19mm, 25mm and 35mm 700C rims
without too much hassle. Getting a 40mm Marathon onto the 19mm rim is
left as an exercise for the experimenter :)

I think it'd be worth asking Schwalbe for support on this too, as
I've noticed them participating in other similar research. Even just
flicking you a bunch of tyres would help a lot.
