<PRE>I'd be interested in more information on the data logger that you used for these tests.  How does it work?  Would Kit Wolf be interested in making another one?

I agree with you on the merits of testing on the road vs on rollers.  I also think that it is important to have a rider on the bicycle (especially when testing on the road).  You can see this in the results when comparing tests run on rollers vs those run on roads.  The ones on rollers show that greater pressure is always better, while tests run on roads show that higher pressure (beyond a certain point) slows the rider down.

I've been involved with the tire testing for Bicycle Quarterly.  We have a strict methodology to get repeatable results across tests.  That includes testing at close to the same temperature (luckily Seattle has a very temperate climate), in zero wind, on the same test track.  We use reference wheels and tires (the tires are never used for anything else) at the start and end of each day to check that we are getting similar results.  The test rider is very stable in his weight, and we use the same test bicycle (also not used for anything else).

&gt;<i>Again, I reported on a test and asked if any HPVers have tested wide,

The post had little to do with the test. I wondered about HPVer
testing and experience.

.......yes I have done a fair amount of on road coast down type measurements. A friend at Bell Labs did the bicycle physics and wrote a couple of spreadsheets and I did a few years of collecting data and testing the system. System meaning the physics, the spreadsheet math,  and a whole string of variables that had to be accounted for.
