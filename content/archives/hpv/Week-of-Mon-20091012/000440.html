<PRE> From what I understand of various tests done at &quot;Bicycle Quarterly&quot;  
sidewall suppleness and tread-thinness are critical for low  
resistance and optimal suspension in wide tires.

I guess that most wide tires today are made for lower performance.  
Like, aren't Marathons an extra-stout touring tire with thick tread?

They say that wide handmade tires were used for top performance on  
French bikes from 1930's-50's. They tended to be 650B in size and  
maybe 38-45mm in width. Also, wide tires apparently haven't been made  
in that quality since that period.

The closest it seems that we can get today are in the revival 650B  
tires by a few off-brands like Grand Bois and Mitsuboshi.

It looks like Dugast makes a 27mm tire high quality sew-up.

Well, I would think they would've tested their tires -- or at least  
used them -- at various pressures and noticest what they did to  
watts / effort.
