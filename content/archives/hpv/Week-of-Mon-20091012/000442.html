&gt;<i>Again, I reported on a test and asked if any HPVers have tested wide,  
</I>soft, supple tires.
The post had little to do with the test. I wondered about HPVer  
testing and experience. 

.......yes I have done a fair amount of on road coast down type measurements. A friend at Bell Labs did the bicycle physics and wrote a couple of spreadsheets and I did a few years of collecting data and testing the system. System meaning the physics, the spreadsheet math,  and a whole string of variables that had to be accounted for. 

Results  can be read on the WISLE site under Projects, then Hpv design, Test and building ,    Coastdown measurements by John Tetz. 
There are three sections. The first two are not accurate. The last one Quantifying Coastdown Measurements, the data is collected with a datalogger built by Kit Wolf from the UK. It made a huge difference in repeatability. 

In this write up I have reported on the variables that effect results (and there are many). 
Crr and CdA are relatively weak functions so things like tiny grades, and wind , temperature, clothing changes on un faired vehicles all mess with the results. Even tire warming during several runs affect results. I didn't do a lot of road surface variability measurements because so much of the time was accounting for other variables.  

I even saw what I believe to be a change in CdA vs speed (low  8 to 16 mph range) particularly on unfaired vehicles (FWD and Trike), but also on a shelled vehicle (Velomobile - not as great). The huge turbulent wake behind the rider on a unfaired bike must be changing characteristics quite a bit.  But even the VM CdA appeared to change.  This means one cant use a fixed value of CdA.   

My conclusion after around 4 years of collecting data is getting a reliable Crr number is very difficult. 

So maybe the roller method may give at least a  relative value. But what does a tire really do on a road surface? 

If your thinking of using a watts meter there are some issues that have to be addressed. Lets say the vehicle CdA is 2.5 sq ft, and the Crr is around .0045. I believe the speed should be low to reduce the influence of CdA. If the speed is low say 10 mph the Crr watts would be around 18 and the CdA watts 12. That's 37% and 57% of total power.  Any change in speed means the CdA is quite influential. At 11 mph the Crr is 53% and CdA % is 42. 
Trying to hold speeds to plus or minus 0.5 mph difference is difficult. One would have to do lots of runs and take an average. Will a watts meter read tiny variations? 
If the speed is higher then CdA is dominant. 

However a few years a go I was an official observer for the Varna team for the hour record up in Canada. When I got there they had been having trouble getting to 60 mph. Because I was just starting to do coastdowns I asked about the tires. They had been using a cheap tire but put on a high price &quot;good&quot; tire, so I suggested going back to the cheap tire. And they got the speed back.  
At 60 mph the Crr is 25% of total power and CdA was 70% yet that new tire created a problem. 
So maybe the system would show a difference. 

But if your doing a tire comparison there is daily temperature variations from run to run to deal with.  Absolutely no wind.  Don't forget calibration of the speed odometer vs tire circumference. . 

&gt;<i>From my experience you wont be able to come up with a Crr number but you might see a change in watts vs different tires. I will be very curious as to the techniques used and the results.  
</I>
I measured only three tires. Big Apples, Greenspeed Scorchers, and Primo Comets All fat tires at 60 psi. . All three were close with the Comets being a bit lower. But what was very noticeable was the ride quality. The Comets gave a much smoother ride. They are also thinner  - lighter so the acceleration is better. I have been running Comets  on all my 406 wheeled bikes. However for city use they probably would flat easier.
