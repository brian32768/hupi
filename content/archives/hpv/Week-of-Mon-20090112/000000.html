<PRE>On behalf of another Danish recumbent rider, without Internet access:

International HPV-event on Champs-Elys&#233;es in Paris during the last week/days
of Le Tour de France 2009?

The cycling-interested press corps is already present in the city, so the
potential for press coverage is enormous!
The year 2009 sees the 75-year &quot;anniversary&quot; of UCI's decision to define a
bicycle in a way that excluded recumbents from racing. Why not &quot;celebrate&quot;
this and at the same time honour the pioneers Charles and Georges Mochet in
their home country? Draw attention to an idea that may have originated in
France, but has caught on all over the world?

The idea is to gather as many recumbents/HPVs as possible from the world
and meet in Paris in a grasshopperswarm of biblical proportions. Less is
also OK!
The French, the Parisians, the tourists, the press, will hopefully and
guided by press releases ask themselves: &quot;These bikes that move or stand
all around town, at attractions, by cafes, everywhere - what are they? Why
are they here? During the Tour?&quot;

He'd love to hear from people who are willing to take on the challenge:
	R&#248; Cycle Labs c/o P&#230;r K&#248;ie Kofod
	R&#248;vej 54
	3760  Gudhjem
	Denmark
	Tel +45 2367 3292

Or you can discuss it here; I can summarize the discussion to him from time
to time. He does not have Internet access himself. I am not involved in the
actual implementation of this idea.


Sincerely,
--

       Psychling - If you believe it will make you ride faster, it will!
