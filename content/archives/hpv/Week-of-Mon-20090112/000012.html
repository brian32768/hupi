......The very beauty of recumbents is their variety. A variety to fit the various needs. Long WB, short, high, low, big wheels, small wheels....  its all so wonderful. 
Many years ago I tried re-designing a DF and found you cant do much with it. When I discovered recumbents the world of possibilities opened up to me.  
And look at the developments that have been accomplished in the recumbent world.  What was learned over the years is now applied to the Velomobile, a very important viable alternate transportation vehicle. 

Some day the public will wake up.
