<PRE>Allow me to preface what I have to say by stating that I ride both a recumbent and an upright, so it is reasonable to assume that I am not afflicted with platform prejudice.  Many competitive events have regulations and established participation categories.  Drag racing comes to mind.  Why some recumbent enthusiasts bemoan the fact that they are unwelcome at UCI events I find puzzling.  Shelving the rabid recumbent evangelism for a moment, the unbiased, astute recumbent enthusiast should realize why stringent,restrictive UCI regulations were put in place.  It is not a matter of unyielding prejudicial myopia or inflexible opposition to technological advances in bicycle design, but rather an attempt to equitably measure athletic performance rather than measure the merits of cutting-edge innovation in bicycle design.  UCI regulation is intended to ensure controlled measurement of the biological engine.  An open field of bicycles in an unregulated
 multiplicity of forms would serve to undermine the UCI objective.  I expect that the UCI will never to be receptive to participation of any bicycle that does not strictly conform to rigid UCI regulations.  Frankly, I wish the Tour de France organizes would invite a recumbent team with UCI blessing (temporary exemption from regulation) with the only restriction being ... no fairings.  When Team Recumbent finished dead last in the team competition and failed to win any of the individual jersey competitions, that would put an end to many a debate regarding recumbent superiority.  If the sole purpose is to raise the awareness of onlookers and demonstrate that their is an alternative to the traditional upright bicycle, a group of recumbents could ride each and every Tour de France stage before the pros do their thing.  Chances are they might even receive some TV coverage. - Jim McNamara
