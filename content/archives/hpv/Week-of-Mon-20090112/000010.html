<PRE>Mike,
The point is we haven't tried enough things under the pressure of race 
conditions to settle on a design, and the bike that performs best in race 
conditions may not do the best in the rat race.

Being a transportation cyclist I'd be more in favor of having road rallies 
and utility cycling events with lots of locations, lots of participants and 
lots of prizes (that fit the accomplishment - like a race for the groceries 
where you get groceries for a prize).

I'm not qualified to say what would happen if we tried to break in to UCI 
where we're not wanted (again).  And I'm not interested after having been in 
a couple of their silly time trials.
Nick

&gt;<i> While recumbent development and thus production economies have lagged 
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i> of this decision, we are still here.  The rational to choose a recumbent
</I>&gt;<i> formate to replace df's might presume that we have settled on one type. 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking
</I>&gt;<i> at the recumbent world we are all over the place in design and 
</I>&gt;<i> construction.
</I>&gt;<i> One way that riders would change if they all tried recumbents and decided 
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> were faster, better handling, safer, more universally accepted...and 
</I>&gt;<i> promoters
</I>&gt;<i> believed there was more money in enhancing us as participants and an
</I>&gt;<i> audience.  I would think we have not reached these goals.
</I>&gt;<i> It is interesting when you see multiple builders building similar 
</I>&gt;<i> recumbents
</I>&gt;<i> if we are reaching a common design like dfs have done. It makes me wonder 
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> we are approaching the most effective possible recumbent designs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many mountainbikers resisted uci incorporation.  Did that kill the amazing
</I>&gt;<i> technology development of the mtb world?  Not sure it didn't slow them 
</I>&gt;<i> down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For now, we race in our niches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is goood to do some demos on this anniversary just to remind 
</I>&gt;<i> folks
</I>&gt;<i> of the options.  I wouldn't expect uci to change bans, but wouldn't it be
</I>&gt;<i> cool if they let the time trial bikes be unlimited in design?  It would 
</I>&gt;<i> move the
</I>&gt;<i> industry greatly.  Would not always get the best rider winning.   It would
</I>&gt;<i> favor the best bike rider combination.
