</I>
&gt;<i> While recumbent development and thus production economies have lagged because 
</I>&gt;<i> of this decision, we are still here.  The rational to choose a recumbent 
</I>&gt;<i> formate to replace df's might presume that we have settled on one type.  Looking 
</I>&gt;<i> at the recumbent world we are all over the place in design and construction.  
</I>&gt;<i> One way that riders would change if they all tried recumbents and decided they 
</I>&gt;<i> were faster, better handling, safer, more universally accepted...and promoters 
</I>&gt;<i> believed there was more money in enhancing us as participants and an 
</I>&gt;<i> audience.  I would think we have not reached these goals.
</I>
  Right - even the well funded Barchetta team in RAAM couldn't beat DF riders.  When it does you might have a  point.

&gt;<i> Many mountainbikers resisted uci incorporation.  Did that kill the amazing 
</I>&gt;<i> technology development of the mtb world?  Not sure it didn't slow them down.
</I>
I don't see any amazing technology in mountain bikes.  A pair of wheels with tires and maybe some suspension.
Am I missing something?

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is goood to do some demos on this anniversary just to remind folks 
</I>&gt;<i> of the options.  I wouldn't expect uci to change bans, but wouldn't it be 
</I>&gt;<i> cool if they let the time trial bikes be unlimited in design?  It would move the 
</I>&gt;<i> industry greatly.  Would not always get the best rider winning.   It would 
</I>&gt;<i> favor the best bike rider combination.
</I>
How would it move the industry?
