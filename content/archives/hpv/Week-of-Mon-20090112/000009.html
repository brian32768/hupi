<PRE>While recumbent development and thus production economies have lagged because 
of this decision, we are still here.  The rational to choose a recumbent 
formate to replace df's might presume that we have settled on one type.  Looking 
at the recumbent world we are all over the place in design and construction.  
One way that riders would change if they all tried recumbents and decided they 
were faster, better handling, safer, more universally accepted...and promoters 
believed there was more money in enhancing us as participants and an 
audience.  I would think we have not reached these goals.
It is interesting when you see multiple builders building similar recumbents 
if we are reaching a common design like dfs have done. It makes me wonder if 
we are approaching the most effective possible recumbent designs?
 
Many mountainbikers resisted uci incorporation.  Did that kill the amazing 
technology development of the mtb world?  Not sure it didn't slow them down.
 
For now, we race in our niches.  
 
I think it is goood to do some demos on this anniversary just to remind folks 
of the options.  I wouldn't expect uci to change bans, but wouldn't it be 
cool if they let the time trial bikes be unlimited in design?  It would move the 
industry greatly.  Would not always get the best rider winning.   It would 
favor the best bike rider combination.
