<PRE>Yes, but people die and times change.  I hope that someone keeps knocking on the door.

Subject: Re: [hpv] 75 years of UCI ban

Well, &quot;The Grand Boucl&#233;&quot; as they call it yes, but my suspicion is that
the official institutions/authorities will always lag behind what's
going on in the real world - thus, the UCI will only admit recumbent
racing into their existing TdF, *after* the existing &quot;premier
calendar&quot;, TdF, etc., have already started to become less relevant,
due to the public increasingly being exposed to recumbent racing
through other channels gradually becoming more &quot;mainstream&quot; and
receiving greater publicity...

TBH I'd see the two as quite different sports in many ways - the
increased effect of drafting on upright bicycles leading to the
peleton etc. making upright stage racing more tactical and interesting
from that perspective, whereas the greater speed of recumbents, in a
more time-trial-like setting, leading to a different sort of
excitement; question is, to what extent should the two be combined?
I.e. to win the TdF, would you need to be both a good (upright) stage
racer, and a good (recumbent) time triallist? The TdF winners do all
seem to be good time triallists these days (??), so....how much
crossover is there? great aerobic capacity is obviously vital for both
forms of bike, but different muscles etc. are used, so will speeds
etc. be higher if riders are allowed to specialise more (by separating
the two)?

At any rate, my feeling is that going for &quot;official&quot; acceptance
through the UCI is the wrong route - as Stuart (among others)
suggests, perhaps a good end goal (tho why stop there, at one TT per
tour?!), but I think the authorities are so conservative they'll never
(try to advance the sport by) incorporate recumbent racing unless it
has already become mainstream and the public are seeing it already....

My 2 cents tho (and I don't think I'm really disagreeing with what's
been said, either!)...

Cheers, Alan

&gt;<i> Again may I suggest that the focus be on an eventual acceptance into the Tours of unlimited individual time trials, one per Tour, over representative suburb to Central routes.  No rules other than no stored energy, streamlining admissible.  The advantage of such a goal is that it does not interfere with the grand and honorable tradition of the peleton, while introducing radical bicycles to the world of cycling to maximum exposure of their extreme speed and excitement.

</I>&gt;<i> On behalf of another Danish recumbent rider, without Internet access:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> International HPV-event on Champs-Elys&#233;es in Paris during the last week/days
</I>&gt;<i> of Le Tour de France 2009?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cycling-interested press corps is already present in the city, so the
</I>&gt;<i> potential for press coverage is enormous!
</I>&gt;<i> The year 2009 sees the 75-year &quot;anniversary&quot; of UCI's decision to define a
</I>&gt;<i> bicycle in a way that excluded recumbents from racing. Why not &quot;celebrate&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> this and at the same time honour the pioneers Charles and Georges Mochet in
</I>&gt;<i> their home country? Draw attention to an idea that may have originated in
</I>&gt;<i> France, but has caught on all over the world?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to gather as many recumbents/HPVs as possible from the world
</I>&gt;<i> and meet in Paris in a grasshopperswarm of biblical proportions. Less is
</I>&gt;<i> also OK!
</I>&gt;<i> The French, the Parisians, the tourists, the press, will hopefully and
</I>&gt;<i> guided by press releases ask themselves: &quot;These bikes that move or stand
</I>&gt;<i> all around town, at attractions, by cafes, everywhere - what are they? Why
</I>&gt;<i> are they here? During the Tour?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He'd love to hear from people who are willing to take on the challenge:
</I>&gt;<i>        R&#248; Cycle Labs c/o P&#230;r K&#248;ie Kofod
</I>&gt;<i>        R&#248;vej 54

</I>&gt;<i>        Denmark
</I>&gt;<i>        Tel +45 2367 3292
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or you can discuss it here; I can summarize the discussion to him from time
</I>&gt;<i> to time. He does not have Internet access himself. I am not involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> actual implementation of this idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
