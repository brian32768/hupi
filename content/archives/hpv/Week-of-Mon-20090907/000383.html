<PRE>Velcro is commonly used to attach body socks to Zzipper and Windwrap fairings. They're quite common here in Portland, and there's a couple seamstresses that make them. They're pretty booked on the &quot;project&quot; front, but a note on the OHPV forum might get you in line.

IIRC, there's a couple tricks: The &quot;hook&quot; side attaches to the fairing- get industrial strength Velcro since the common stuff is kind of weak. The &quot;loop&quot; side needs to be elastic since it gets sewn to the fabric. Also, the sock is attached on the outside of the fairing so fabric tension holds everything together. If it's on the inside, it'll pull apart.

A couple folks have windows sewn into the tops of the socks so they can see their computers- I can't comment on how this is done. I think the windows are sewn into non-stretchy fabric, which is then sewn into the top of the sock.

'Round here, they come in every color of the rainbow!

&gt;<i> I want to make a body stocking for this bike, mainly to protect me from the weather.  I have some nice flexible fabric that windsurfers use, sort of like Darlexx.  I would like to attach it somehow to the trailing edge of the fairing and to the front of the tailbox, so that I can remove it easily and equipped with removable side panels/zipper door.

&gt;<i> Any suggestions for attaching the fabric to the plastic fairing and tailbox?  I have thought of Velcro adhesive strips, but that doesn't sound very durable.  Or hooks or a zipper strip.
