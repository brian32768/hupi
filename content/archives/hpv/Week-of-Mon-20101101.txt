Hi all

Over the last few months, Jim Wilson from bikerodnkustom
http://bikerodnkustom4.homestead.com/cover9_03.html has been interviewing me 
by
email. It was a bit of a stop-start process and we rambled over a range of
topics. So here it is, the interview is sticking out like bits of a dogs
anatomy amidst all the chopper bikes.

As well as this I have 2 entries in the Melbourne bikefest design 
competition
http://www.melbournebikefest.com.au/better-by-bike
which will be judged shortly. The Rotovelo from Trisled is one of the other
entries. Another designer (Mark Watson who designed the Tote trailer) has
already been in touch with me.

Regards

Steve Nurse
