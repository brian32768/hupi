Like womens skirt lengths and financial recessions these non-round chainrings show up on an every fifteen to twenty years cycle:-) 

Just long enough for psychological extinction to set in from the last time they were tried. The difference this time seems to be the PowerTap and other measurement methods can be seen to show an improvement under  some real world conditions for the first time instead of the usual reliance on endorsements or theoretical calculations only for their sales. The problem of adapting human leg anatomy to the sinusoidal crank is real, but generally compensated sufficiently by the ankle.  Perhaps we've finally demonstrated these devices efficacy over compensatory training routines that sometimes fall apart under maximum stress.

  Of course, there could still be the placebo effect at work as these are human beings being tested.  The churlish nature in me makes me also consider the possibility of patent expirations playing into the appearance of these devices at this time. Could the strict drug testing in the Tour at this time also have led towards searching out a mechanical advantage that fits UCI rules once again?
