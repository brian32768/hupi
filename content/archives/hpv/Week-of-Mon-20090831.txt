Interesting and slick design.  No pedal option.  Love the folding.  13
mph top speed, which is probably a good thing, given the design.

"Yike" must refer to the reaction when people find out the price. Yoiks!

Ah, yes.  I saw that several days ago.  However; did you notice the  
price?    $5,500!!  Now I understand why they call it the YIKE!!

Pretty cool HPV monorail.  Minimum footprint, plenty fast, good weather 
protection w/o being oppressive.

My first reaction to the video was "miniature Ordinary", which was later re-inforced by the "mini-farthing" website, as though any of you Yanks has the faintest idea what is a farthing, or how it applies to bikes. I like the idea, I like the music ("It Feels So Good"), and I liked the text "I park where I damn well Yike", which I already do, being an order of magnitude or two more formidable than the Yike rider in the video.

So, a collapsible motorbike shaped like a penny-farthing.  Yes, mate.

I like the look but the danger of it seems a bit scary.
