I think there are several effects. Many people of my age (over 60) are 
used to mailing lists but have &quot;heard it all&quot; and are tired or too busy. 
Many of us boycott Zuckerberg's Walled Garden and similar things for 
various reasons. (I do have an account on Diaspora (which is what 
Facebook *should* be), however I can't find any HPV-activity except a 
group <A HREF="https://diasp.eu/tags/velo">https://diasp.eu/tags/velo</A> with a single French-speaking member!)

Young people however are used to Facebook and most simply no longer 
respond to any proper emails unless they really have to, even when 
subscribed to lists. The new electronic media have increased rather than 
decreased the digital divide. (In Switzerland they are also killing 
cycling: young people prefer to use public transport where they can 
constantly follow their online lives).

I think what works best these days is combination of web articles and a 
lightly moderated forum, especially if this *also* sends emails to 
registered users. However these requires quite some resources and 
interest, otherwise they also die.


Thanks Brian for sticking at it so long! As maintainer and host it is 
your decision whether to stop now. Can you keep the archives up or 
transfer statically to /www?

Goodbye, list! Please remember that you can send articles to me for 
Human Power eJournal <A HREF="http://hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm">http://hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm</A>
or use the WHPVA Pedalwiki:
<A HREF="http://wiki.whpva.org/vph/index.php?title=Pedalwiki">http://wiki.whpva.org/vph/index.php?title=Pedalwiki</A>

The former site will continue: Brian will find a cheap webhost and I'll 
continue to sponsor the domain, or Dave Wilson or John St.

The latter site is rather dead and split up into three languages, but do 
get an account and write interesting pages, if you like. It is hosted 
and sponsored by Catatec in Bern, Switz.

whpva.org had a forum once, but this got lost. It is now a static 
website and we have a mailing list for purely administrative purposes. 
ihpva.org still has its forum, but there are few recent postings.

Cheers everybody!
