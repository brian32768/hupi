Curiously enough, the admin of another mailing list to which I subscribe 
proposed its retirement only a couple of days ago.  Which immediately 
brought a flurry of posters out of the woodwork...

Apropos these lists, however, I think they've probably had their day. 
Just as long as no-one imposes fearful consequences on anyone having the 
temerity not to want to play in Mr Zuckerberg's Walled Garden ;-)

Many thanks to all the admins past and present for keeping the thing 
running.
