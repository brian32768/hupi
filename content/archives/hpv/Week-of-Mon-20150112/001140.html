<PRE>I have been a long time reader of this and the some of the related lists 
and value what is said here as each member has an established reputation 
(like visiting long-time friends).

I understand the desire to move this to a new format (although I don't 
dislike this one), but moving it to something associated with BROL if 
possible (as he has a huge, dedicated userbase of mostly like-minded 
people) is FAR preferable than something associated with Facebook, 
Twitter, or similar (based on personal reasons).

A forum format can allow a huge volume of ideas to be present (like 
BROL), but if you don't keep up with the forum they can disappear 
quickly from &quot;easy&quot; discovery. The mailing list format makes sure we can 
see everything, but is really only manageable for limited user input 
because high volume can end up leading to immediate trash-canning of 
email due to lack of time and too many emails (even with a digest ability).

If there was some way to send forum posts to an automatically sorting 
wiki so that long-term retrieval was easy and viable, that would be even 
better - and perhaps lead to fewer reposts by people who didn't know 
that the topic had just been discussed last month (not a problem here). 
There has been much intelligent information shared here over the years 
that, while perhaps saved, is somewhat &quot;lost&quot; due to the difficulty in 
retrieval of the information.
