This may not be quite what you are expecting from the subject line.  :D

Most of you are probably already familiar with the antics we do up here
in Ottawa enabled by the creations of a certain list member from Ferntree
Gully...

Last Saturday HPVOoO (Human Powered Vehicle Operators of Ottawa)
participated yet again in the annual Ottawa Firefighters Help Santa Toy
Parade.  This time we had the ambitious idea of turning my Greenspeed
GTVs6 tandem with the Hammond organ trailer into a steam train in lights
for a night parade.

This was the result:

And here is some of the backgrounder on how we got there:

Some comments from the general public that got back to me indirectly
include &quot;That's the first time downtown Ottawa has heard a real live
train horn in more than 40 years.&quot; (In a poor decision on the part of
regional planners, our &quot;central&quot; train station was moved about 5km away
from Parliament Hill sometime in the early 1960s.)

We've got another parade coming up this coming Saturday in a suburb
about 15km away.
