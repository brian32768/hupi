Subject: [trikes] Safe biking area for kids
Message-ID: <51EC1112.7050007@zalonoffice.com>

I live in West Orange and have two grandkids that love to ride their 
bikes. Trouble is, there are not many safe places that allow bikes to 
roam free.

Does anyone have a good idea where I can take them for a family ride?

Thanks in advance,

Jules
