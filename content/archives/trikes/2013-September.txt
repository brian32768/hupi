Subject: [trikes] Recs for chain tensioners?
Message-ID: <CANNQeo+N=msh19abi62xVLZyX9V3HykqwqgpTZYVFQmwdCbU7g@mail.gmail.com>

I want to add a chain tensioner for my OT ELF.  Jockey wheel can take up
more chain so that seems to make more sense.

I guess my priorities are starting high:

good recs
durable
rebuildable
cost

Thanks all, hope your silence is not a sign of demise.

I'm sorry, I don't understand the term "recs."  I'm not familiar with  
the OT ELF, either - I'll just assume it is similar to most tadpoles.  
Part of a junked rear derailleur can be hacked to do the basic job,  
but trike chains are subject to side forces and shaking that can  
throw a chain off, so it helps to add guides to the roller cage.   
Standard 8t derailleur jockey pulleys are high-friction.  If there is  
room for larger idlers, that is better, as are ball bearing centers.

Subject: [trikes] Tilting trikes or TTW or a SEGWAY in the roll plane
Message-ID: <000301cebb7c$0bed6850$23c838f0$@net>

After many years of avocation (work more than I care to count) I have a
version of a reasonable Tilting trike system or TTW. It works mainly as a
tadpole but would work as a delta also. 

 

My concept is a machine where you are a non tilting trike at low speed and
you are a virtual bicycle at high speed. In short you take off from a trike
transform to a enhanced bike and land back into a trike as a cycle.

 

This does not mean much unless you ride it. Video may help a little. I rode
Ice and Veloteknik suspended trikes at  the Midwest recumbent rally and see
and feel the type has advanced quite a bit. I think my TTW would compete
price wise if commercialized IMHO. The solution is a much simplified version
of the APAX. I will post a link to it if there is enough interest here.

 

Anyway I am canvassing to see if there is any imagination interest in this
concept at this time. It could work in velomobile and a natural for e- 

Bikes all challenging fields in themselves. The old saw of the TTW is to
combine the best of bike and trike dynamics for a net marketable gain. 

 

Best regards,

Sounds very interesting Wayne, I'd definitely like to see some photos 
and/or video.
