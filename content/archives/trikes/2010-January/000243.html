<PRE>Hi Bob,
 
Following your advice, I have been testing with plastic soft drink bottles.
They are working fabulously - the lack of a rubber internal dividing
membrane seems to make no difference. 
 
The damping is better able to be adjusted, as the opening into the soft
drink bottle is larger than the openings into the pressure accumulator I was
using. And of course, the bottles cost nothing and are 1/10th the weight of
the accumulators! Also, the lack of a need to bleed the system, use two
filling points, etc, is excellent. 
 
The 'wooshing squishes' of water shooting in and out of the bottles is
interesting, but that occurs audibly only on the largest of bumps. 
 
At least I now have a system I can extensively test. 
 
Thank you.
 
Regards,
 
Julian Edgar

The rubber is to prevent slow loss of air through the flowing water.
Presumably, one could bubble air up into a bottle, and let the water in the
system reach saturation.  A bleed valve could probably be installed at the
top end of the tank for convenience, but the savings would be ounces against
hours, I guess.

Yes that's so, Bob. Trouble is, the accumulators need a rubber membrane
mid-point within the bottle, and fittings both sides of the membrane.

FWIW, I have tested common carbonated beverage containers to 140 PSI and
deliberately dinged them with gravel-like impacts with no problem. 
 
Best,
Bob Stuart
Your  cheap damper expert.  :-)

I am using commercially available accumulators, normally used on boat
pressurised water systems. In my machine the max air pressure is only 30
psi; the accumulators are rated to 120 psi. Each accumulator weighs about
400g; including water the total weight of the suspension springing/damping
system is about 3kg.
