<PRE>Hi Jules,
If your wrench isn't used to recumbents he might not have seen the problem before - it is usually a problem of water collecting at the low point of a cable loop - either from rain, road spray or condensation. Stick bikes cable runs tend not to have these loops at the lowest point for moisture to accumulate and so they drain naturally. 
Sealed cables, either as Phil suggest using lube, or as I mentioned using PTFE liners, fixes the problem.

If you are going to the expense of the work I'd strongly recommend the lined cables but I suspect the tech used by each cable brand is pretty much the same... I think I paid GBP20 (US$30?) for my last set of Flak Jacket gear cables and GBP10 (US$15) for Nokon (a very special offer - they seem to be 4x dearer now) both of which I've been happy with.

Good luck!
Rob

&gt;<i> Thanks, Rob. My local wrench doesn't think that's the problem . . . but honestly I do. So I'm going to bring it in and have then totally change over the cables and housing. Worst case: it won't get any better, but I'll have upgraded my ride.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I found good quality cables with continuous PTFE liners fixed this problem - this keeps out the moisture which can then freeze.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gore Ride-On are maybe the leading brand but at the highest price. I have successfully used Nokon and SRAM Flak Jacket. Look in the mountain bike section of your preferred bike shop/web site.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And, at least here in the UK where temps only drop a few degrees below freezing, hydraulic disc brakes do not seem to suffer from this problem - I'm assured they're good to at least -10C.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The no-cost solution is to ensure the trike is kept in a damp and condensation free environment - but this isn't always practical if it is your daily commuter!!!
