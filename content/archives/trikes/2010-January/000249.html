<PRE>I`m using trampoline fabric, from a local manufacturer, for seats.  It`s much cheaper.

Subject: Re: [trikes] Greenspeed Seat Fabric

Thanks Giles,

I cut the fabric, and the grommets are mostly not touching steel now.  A couple are close.  I could make them further but I didn't want to cut the fabric past the hem until seeing if others are cut past the hem.

At $100+ for new fabric, I don't want to cut it too far.

Notice this persons picture shows a gap in the seat fabric where the horizontal supports go?

There were not gabs in mine and the grommets really ground into the frame.  The other GTR's I have seen all had gaps or cuts to go around the seat frame.  I have been very happy with my dealer and the service, but a few items on assembly were not quite done with the care of others I have seen.

You have a good point though, my fabric has an 8.5 inch gab on the back side......others look to be closer to 5-6 inches.  Maybe the fabric is a bit too small.

Those pictures are not of mine, just the first pics I found on google of greenspeed seats from the underside.

Thanks for the input,
Chris

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess I am hard up for cycling time.........I decided to re-string my seat fabric on my Greenspeed GTR.  It needs to be tightened, straightened, and I need something to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been VERY happy with my Greenspeed overall, but I was disappointed in how the seat fabric was attached.  The metal grommets hit the horizontal seat frame pieces, and have ground gouges into the paint/metal.  I noticed online that other GTR's have the fabric sliced so that the grommets do not touch the metal frame.  This probably also helps against the fabric sliding and slipping over time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I cleaned and touched up the gouges last night with some of the touchup paint that came with the trike (sweet) and am going to restring the seat.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How far is the fabric cut on your seat mesh?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like your seat is too small - there should be plenty of overlap and the brass grommets should be nowhere near any steel. You could whip up a new one on a sewing machine, or else slip in a bit of fabric to keep the metal bits apart.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More overlap means a stiffer seat, as there is less bungy cord to stretch. that way it won't fret on the paint as much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, there are some small bumps and rough texture under the paint on the horizontal seat frame pieces.  Is it starting to rust or is it just not finished as smoothly as the rest of the trike?  I can send links to pics if needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
