<PRE>Hi Mike,
 
Differentiation data function is available in the software, but I didn't
want to utterly confuse everyone. 
 
I have separately sent you a spreadsheet of the recorded Chalky data (you
can email it to yourself from the iPhone). 
 
Also note any DC offset is dialled out of the data. So the static 1g is not
there.
 
 
Regards,
 
Julian Edgar

Differentiate the data to report the correct measurand for comfort, or its
lack - &quot;jerk&quot; is the term of art for the time rate of change of
acceleration.  Acceleration is not always an informative measurand for
comfort.  Acceleration can be quite comfortable - lying in bed for instance
has 1G; more than anything you have measured with your iPhoney or iTouchy.
But the jerk is very small in bed, as opposed to on the trike.
 
Acceleration is a good measure of the instantaneous force on a vibrating
component. (F=ma)  Acceleration might tell you the magnitude of stress and
strain and allow you to estimate whether a part will break and help you to
optimize it.  But it is only indirectly, and in certain circumstances, an
analog for comfort.
 
It is the jerk that makes you bit your tongue.  (In more ways than one.)
 
Mike

Hi Folks,

If you have an iPhone or iTouch you can buy ($6) very good software that
allows direct comparisons of ride comfort of different machines. The
software is called 'Vibration'. It measures actual  accelerations
vertically, and in pitch and roll. I take the measurements at my head.

I have been comparing the ride comfort of my pneumatic / hydraulic suspended
trike (&quot;Chalky&quot;)  against a Brompton folding bike (16 inch wheels, sprung
seat, small-travel rear suspension) and a Gazelle Medeo Plus (high quality
commuting bike, 28 inch wheels, sprung seat post, sprung front forks).
Chalky has 16 inch wheels.
The tests were conducted at a fairly slow pace over a bumpy grass-and-dirt
surface.

j%0d%0apg&gt; 
pg graphs the RMS values for accelerations in X, Y and Z planes of the three
machines over the test course.
<A HREF="http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/RRGazChal.jpg">http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/RRGazChal.jpg</A> - shows
the actual traces for the measurements.
I found the software very good, especially when attempting to gain best
compromises between conflicting requirements - eg reducing body roll by the
use of a stiffer anti-roll bar versus the resulting increase in the wheel
rates in one-wheel bumps. Spring rates, suspension interconnection and
damping rates were all also developed using the data.

Regards,

Julian Edgar
