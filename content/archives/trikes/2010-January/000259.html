<PRE>Hi Folks,
 
If you have an iPhone or iTouch you can buy ($6) very good software that
allows direct comparisons of ride comfort of different machines. The
software is called 'Vibration'. It measures actual  accelerations
vertically, and in pitch and roll. I take the measurements at my head. 
 
I have been comparing the ride comfort of my pneumatic / hydraulic suspended
trike (&quot;Chalky&quot;)  against a Brompton folding bike (16 inch wheels, sprung
seat, small-travel rear suspension) and a Gazelle Medeo Plus (high quality
commuting bike, 28 inch wheels, sprung seat post, sprung front forks).
Chalky has 16 inch wheels. 
The tests were conducted at a fairly slow pace over a bumpy grass-and-dirt
surface.

pg graphs the RMS values for accelerations in X, Y and Z planes of the three
machines over the test course.
<A HREF="http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/RRGazChal.jpg">http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/RRGazChal.jpg</A> - shows
the actual traces for the measurements. 
I found the software very good, especially when attempting to gain best
compromises between conflicting requirements - eg reducing body roll by the
use of a stiffer anti-roll bar versus the resulting increase in the wheel
rates in one-wheel bumps. Spring rates, suspension interconnection and
damping rates were all also developed using the data.
 
Regards,
