<PRE>Well Julian,
                  You are doing a lot better than me! I can NEVER remember 
NOT to use certain gear combinations. However I have found it possible
to set the chain up to reach large to large, and then all that happens if
I'm stupid enough to use small to small, is the chain drags on the ground.
Rather than not having enough chain to go large to large and then
wrecking the R/D, as I have done :-(

The short cage R/D will give a crisper change simply because it is designed
to be used with close ratio racing or road bike cassette, and the upper 
pulley should be closer to the cassette, plus with a smaller run of chain
between the two pulleys, I would expect better control of the chain.

And like you say, the swinging chain will have less leverage over the upper
R/D pivots..........

Regards, Ian

Subject: short cage derailluer


&gt;<i> As previously mentioned I have had problems with my derailleur dragging on
</I>&gt;<i> the ground when passing over rocks and through holes. (16 inch wheels.) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ian Sims of Greenspeed suggested fitting a short cage derailleur and a
</I>&gt;<i> Schlumf front drive, the latter reducing the necessity to take up so much
</I>&gt;<i> chain slack when running on the small front cog. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fitted a short cage derailleur but kept the front triple chainrings - and
</I>&gt;<i> found what perhaps lots of people already know... if you're careful in your
</I>&gt;<i> gear selection, you can use a 9 speed rear cluster and a three front
</I>&gt;<i> chainrings with a short derailleur. I just make sure that when I am on the
</I>&gt;<i> largest front ring, I don't change down much on the rear cogs before
</I>&gt;<i> dropping down a front ratio.  It's pretty easy to remember, especially when
</I>&gt;<i> the front cogs are right in front of you. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All combinations of the smaller two front chain rings work with all
</I>&gt;<i> combinations of the rear gears - it's only when on the large front ring that
</I>&gt;<i> you need to take care. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The shorter cage also seems to keep high speed gears tracking better -
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the previous long cage derailleur was flexing sideways a bit with
</I>&gt;<i> the length of slack chain in front of it swinging from side to side?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have improved the derailleur ground clearance by about 30mm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Julian Edgar
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
