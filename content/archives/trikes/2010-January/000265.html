<PRE>As previously mentioned I have had problems with my derailleur dragging on
the ground when passing over rocks and through holes. (16 inch wheels.) 
 
Ian Sims of Greenspeed suggested fitting a short cage derailleur and a
Schlumf front drive, the latter reducing the necessity to take up so much
chain slack when running on the small front cog. 
 
I fitted a short cage derailleur but kept the front triple chainrings - and
found what perhaps lots of people already know... if you're careful in your
gear selection, you can use a 9 speed rear cluster and a three front
chainrings with a short derailleur. I just make sure that when I am on the
largest front ring, I don't change down much on the rear cogs before
dropping down a front ratio.  It's pretty easy to remember, especially when
the front cogs are right in front of you. 
 
All combinations of the smaller two front chain rings work with all
combinations of the rear gears - it's only when on the large front ring that
you need to take care. 
 
The shorter cage also seems to keep high speed gears tracking better -
perhaps the previous long cage derailleur was flexing sideways a bit with
the length of slack chain in front of it swinging from side to side?
 
I have improved the derailleur ground clearance by about 30mm.

Julian Edgar
