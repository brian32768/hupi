<PRE>Hey guys,

I guess I am hard up for cycling time.........I decided to re-string my 
seat fabric on my Greenspeed GTR.  It needs to be tightened, 
straightened, and I need something to do.

I have been VERY happy with my Greenspeed overall, but I was 
disappointed in how the seat fabric was attached.  The metal grommets 
hit the horizontal seat frame pieces, and have ground gouges into the 
paint/metal.  I noticed online that other GTR's have the fabric sliced 
so that the grommets do not touch the metal frame.  This probably also 
helps against the fabric sliding and slipping over time.

I cleaned and touched up the gouges last night with some of the touchup 
paint that came with the trike (sweet) and am going to restring the seat.

How far is the fabric cut on your seat mesh?

Also, there are some small bumps and rough texture under the paint on 
the horizontal seat frame pieces.  Is it starting to rust or is it just 
not finished as smoothly as the rest of the trike?  I can send links to 
pics if needed.

Thanks,
Chris
