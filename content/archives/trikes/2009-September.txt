Subject: [trikes] Hope break problem
Message-ID: <717564.61940.qm@web52502.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

All -- I have a Greenspeed with Hope Closed 2 disk brakes.  Because of a combination of circumstances I have not ridden it since last summer.
When I got it out today one of the brakes seems to be stuck in the closed position.  Opening the screw adjuster has no effect.
The brake lever does feel a little 'squishy' but it has hardly any play compared to the opposite brake and the pads are clearly gripping the disk.  
While it is possible to ride the bike in a straight line (that is the brake is not locked up) the wheel barely moves when you lift the front end of the trike and 
attempt to spin the wheel. 

The Hope instructions don't cover this situation.  Should I try bleeding the brake and replacing the fluid or????
Thanks for any help.

Kathy in Cincinnati

Hi Kate;

I suspect that the slave pistons are stuck because of the lack of use.
The first thing to try is to unbolt the calipers and, using a suitable
flat bladed srewdriver, force the pads open. Then put the calipers over
the disk so that the disk is between the pads - no need to bolt them in
place - and squeeze the brake levers. Repeat this a couple of times
being carefull not to squeeze the brake lever unless the disk is between
the pads.

You probably do not have a problem with with the brake fluid but, in any
case, bleeding the brakes or replacing the fluid is the very last thing
to try because it is often difficult to refill the system.

Hey,
        I have  Trice Explorer with  Hope Minidiscs.  I have found that they 
are very easy to disassemble, clean and reassemble and bleed.

If the pistons are just stuck through lack of use (as Peter Bradshaw suspects) 
then be carefull as you follow his instructions in case the pistons have 
stuck to the seal .. you dont want to tear the seal.  I got a lot of spares 
for my Hope Minidiscs from:-

   http://www.ukbikestore.co.uk/

Seals, washers, etc

The Hope website is at:-

   http://www.hopetech.com/

There is some technical information on that site. 

One of my discs had an oversize piston which caused it to stick as yours do.
I contacted Hope in the USA and they refurbished the caliper for me.  You 
might wish to contact them if you feel you cannot handle freeing the piston 
yourself.  They repaired my caliper and got it back to me within two days .. 
they were in Southern California (in Cherry Valley) and I live in San jose so 
YMMV.  I dont know if they still have that office in the USA.

cheers
pete

I have Hope Minis on my Trice Micro and once had trouble with the 
brakes sticking on - the pads were not retracting properly - I (several 
times) took the calipers off and cleaned around the pistons before 
forcing (VERY CAREFULLY) them back - each time the brakes seemed to 
work, but as soon as I started riding, they would stick on again - 
eventually I realised it was the was brake levers that were sticking - 
a drop of oil on each lever pivot and everything worked perfectly again.

Jim,

At last another bent rider chimes in.  The common wisdom of uprights
has to be viewed with a jaundiced eye when you are a bent guy.

Don't ever mash is your only path.  If you don't spin shorter cranks,
then there is little reason to have them.  But theoretically, mashing
shorter cranks should be less hard on them because the joint angles
are going to be less. (Significant? Depends on the the lengths being
compared.)

I think if you are having trouble and are considering not being able
to ride at all, then try some really short cranks before giving up
(with the requisite lower gearing all around).  Dotek 150mm should be
findable without a large expense (used = very cheap).  These will
probably have smaller MTB chainrings, too.  I know a trike home
builder who has used these a lot.  To go shorter you need to keep an
eye pealed for used cranks that have a solid arm than can be shortened
- there is enough metal where the new holes go.  It takes a machinist
that is patient and creative, but you can get a new hole drilled
paralell to the BB.  Re-threading taps can be used to tap the hole.
It is hard to find anything like a regular tap, but re-threading taps
are not uncommon and will work if you are careful.  Park Tool?

Have you seen the right professionals about your knees?  I was
misdiagnosed as having patella-femoral syndrome by an orthopedic
surgeon. Turns out I really had developed flat feet and inserts cured
all.  This was winkled out by a PhD in Physical Therapy.  All I had to
do was stand across the room from her and she sussed it out.

There is an exercise for the inner quad (I forget the correct name)
where you squeeze a ball between your knees while doing a light half
squat.  This muscle is implicated in pattelo femoral syndrome which is
an imbalance of muscles and a banjo tight illiotibial band.  It causes
your knee cap to track off to the side of where it should be.  PT is
the solution.

You said inside of the thigh, maybe you meant a groin muscle not a
quad?  That would be something different.

Good luck.

Mike

Funny, I mistook this for a comment to a non bent non trike list I was
involved in.  25Hz was using the Doteks.  Maybe he can help you find
some.

There are also the Bulletproof cranks from

get down to 140mm for 50 dollars.

I have had several knee issues.... (cartilage, torn quad tendon) but 
switching to 140mm was the cure for me.... got  me back on my trike...

Here 140mm are on SOME junior size or kids BMX style....

I also shortened a few sets.... bought a set of Hozan  taps, and they 
work fine...

Jim: If you are uncertain about whether to spring for shorter cranks 
(or, perhaps more importantly, what length to get), you might consider 
buying a set of crank shorteners. It will save the hassle of finding a 
decent used crank and then having to get the holes tapped correctly.

I got a set from Tandems East [tandemseast at gmail.com]. They cost me 
$115.00 last November for a set that has four holes (they shorten the 
crank arms by 24mm, 41mm, 59mm & 76mm), which gives you a wide set of 
options. They easily bolt onto your current cranks and so far they have 
stayed put. No play, no loosening. I shortened my crank length just one 
notch: from 175mm to 151mm but it made pedaling a lot easier.

FYI.

Hi Jim, I have some 155mm road cranks in 130/74bcd configuration  
(http://www.pbwbikes.com/product_info.php/cPath/26/products_id/65) that  
are well-made generic ones.

It is tempting to drill a hole and tap it by hand. In practice, it is  
almost impossible to get the hole to be lined up correctly. If the hole is  
drilled or the tapping is akimbo, then your foot will rotate around in a  
randomly oriented circle as you pedal. This may not be good for your knee.

If you want to be sure of it, make sure you hold the crank accurately and  
securely and drill straight down with a machine. A milling machine works  
great if you have some fixturing.

A Schlumpf-drive is easily configured with a wide range of lengths.

Best regards, --Hugh

Hi Jim

One thing that I did not see mentioned yet is the pedal to pedal spacing and
the pedals type.

 The first change I made to help with knee pain on GS-GTO is to use
Speedplay Frog pedals which allow a large rotation. Next I found help from
using pedal extenders -- using 20mm.  I notice that my feet have to angle
with toes out on the trike and my heel would strike the inner part of the
pedal without extenders.  I am still using the original cranks supplied by
Greenspeed -- I think they are 170mm.

With DF bike, I do not have any of these problems and use Shimano M959 pedal
which has a limited rotation.

I fitted my wife's TT3.6 with 155mm cranks, Speedplay Frog pedals and 20mm
pedal extenders -- this fixed knee pain for her.

I have read all the posts with great interest.  Everyone claims it is easier to spin.  My question is what rpm are you spinning.  I tend to spin between 72 and 82 rpm.  What rpm are the shorter crank people spinning?

Hi Ed, Ihave shorter cranks on all my trikes. Actually have crank shorteners from Tandemseast.com. There are 4 holes you can use. I think mine are about 165 . Maybe a little shorter on a GT3 I just took to my dau when she was recovering from surgery for the last 3 weeks. I would ride in the morning for an hour before she woke up. The road was a park and flat. Only flat ground I have ridden. I would spin as much as 85-95 and that shocked me. Uusally riding I am happy to spin 60. My knees just don't like the 170 cranks. Fran

By the sounds of it, you already have some short cranks, which is good.  If 
you're still grinding on them, that's worse than if you had stayed with 
longer cranks.

Short cranks aren't a cure all for pedalling and knee woes.  If you are 
spinning with long cranks, your cadence will increase with short ones, and 
you will be quite happy with them and so will your knees.  If you are 
grinding with long cranks don't be surprised if short cranks make your knees 
worse.  The cadence is irrelevent, it's foot speed that is important - 
cadence is just how we measure it.  If your foot speed on the short cranks 
is as slow as on the long ones, your knees will hurt more because your lever 
arm is shorter.  Short cranks MIGHT help your knees, even with too low of a 
cadence because they bend your knee less.

Bottom line, is you need to spin at 80 to 100 for long cranks, and obviously 
the cadence will be higher with shorter ones.  Especially if you have bad 
knees.  If your muscles get tired from spinning, that's because you don't 
spin enough.  So keep spinning.  My knees are busted up too, and aside from 
all the benefit spinning, short cranks and oval rings have provided, I 
recently stumbled across a few pages talking about the evils of being "quad 
dominant".  I present all the symptoms of slightly knock kneed, knees 
together when I stand up from sitting, popping knees, rolled ankles, flat 
feet, etc.  I've been doing some simple exercises (about 4 minutes a day at 
lunch) to cure it and the improvements are fast and obvious.  I'll see if I 
can track down the site again.

This is in response to Ed Logan's query about what rpm we spin at:

Despite the fact that I have an arthritic knee (the result of the 
surgical removal of my meniscus around 50 years ago), I still consider 
myself a grinder on my uprights, which have 175s on them. My cadence on 
uprights is generally around 90. The reason I opted for the crank 
shorteners (now set at 150mm ) is because it felt like I was lifting my 
knees almost to my stomach when pedaling my Greenspeed GTO (originally 
with 175s) and I was wasting a lot of energy doing it. So my switching 
to shorter cranks was for both comfort and efficiency. I find that my 
cadence is usually around 100; sometimes much higher, but I can't stay 
much higher than 100 for very long. It just tires me out.

But I agree that the cure for that is to spin even more.


Jules
