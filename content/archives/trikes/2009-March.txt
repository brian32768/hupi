This is fourth suspension trike. #2 and #3 with airbags. In between I have
built a LWB recumbent bike with airbag suspension but I didn't like it.

Not dead, just quiet over (Oz) summer - too hot to do much riding either.

Will be starting on a velomobile body this year, after cleaning up some 
low-hanging steering bits on the trike. Suspension too (albeit not as 
good as Edgar's)

By my count this is your third, isn't it? Air bags again?

1) I think that perhaps I don't like LWB recumbent bikes full stop - I had
never ridden one before

2) Wrong spring motion ratio - springing too soft

3) Dive under brakes. Changed front suspension to give better anti-dive but
then front suspension too harsh

4) Simply nowhere near as good as my Air 150 suspension trike -
http://www.autospeed.com.au/cms/A_109615/article.html  and
http://www.autospeed.com.au/cms/A_109618/article.html

Now designing and building another suspension trike that I hope will be as
good on-road as Air 150 but with a little less weight, and having the
ability to be broken right down. Different front suspension design to Air
150, similar rear design but with a space frame rear arm. Testing this one
on road step by step, and front suspension seems to be working OK. Steering
on third iteration though...

Ahh, the litigious USA.

As a former trucker, he should have some understanding of how a higher (knee height) seat and narrower (door width) vehicle will affect stability...one would hope.  Working as "friends", with no money changing hands, should give you good liability defence.

"Frankentrike"? "Trikenstien"? "Mosquito on steroids"?
Do any of these quirky terms sound familiar to you? I used them to describe you unusual  home creation with all 26" wheels! Now I need your help! Old PC crashed and lost everything saved.

Please respond! On or off list. Notice nobody posts anymore?

During a ride around 'my' lakepark, met an older gentleman who was in a power-chair/scooter/hove-around. Said he liked my DragonFlyer and wanted one to work out his left leg/arm. Little use due to a stroke. Told him about price and backed off. Is 72, used to drive an 18 wheeler, told him about my hobby. Can arc weld but said he 'loves' to braze as it is much easier to him. Has no tools and lives in apartment with wife. Here is my plan.
Am willing to measure, cut, miter, jig up, donate all and "allow" him to make his own joints. Why, you may ask. Just can't make myself to buy $1500 insurance! I believe he can make his own frame for his personal use, so no problem with liability.
Wants to make his with seat no lower then his knees, not sure about narrowness to push thru apartment door.
Thanks for anyone (or original poster) who replys.

If I am going to pay 8000 #  I want it to be NEW!!!

I have parts on my bikes like that too --- made and remade -- mostly
due to Oregon weather.
I am hoping the way to solve that particular problem will be by moving

Looks pretty slick though I'd really want it to be a velo at that

Very lovely machine, but the cost puts it in the rarified air of those who can actually afford to buy (not rent occasionally) a Farrari, Bently, etc.

I noticed that the designer seems to have every indication of being an industrial designer, with furniture, trike, motorcycle/scooter, and sculture.  If he has an industrial design background then his trike design makes even more sense to me.

I wonder though why he goes to all the trouble of making a 100% carbon fiber highly engineered frame, add exotic, custom, semi custom, or just extremely "high end" components, make a custom adjustable seat, have two frame sizes, yet not make it as light as possible.  The machine appears to be a speed/performance machine, though he says it is what it is.  With the weight restriction (regardless of the 300% safety factor he says it has), I'd think it would be usable as a light touring machine.  

Personally I find it beautiful, very interesting as a design project, but otherwise a very impractical machine, price wise.  I hope he finds a way to reduce cost enough to get significant sales, though in the current US (and world) economy, maybe only the rich will be able to afford such a trike.

I ride an Organic Engine's Triclops, now a few years old (around 5 or 6), which was somewhat expensive only due to my having customizations on the basic factory model.  But it still rides great, is still fully adjustable, can haul stuff too, and is as much fun today as it was when I first got it.  I may get another trike at some point, but for now my old standby still does the trick.  But again, man, what a cool machine that carbon beauty is.

It's a joke, right?

It looks just like any other amateur first attempt at a recumbent
trike, albeit one with some design flair and made of carbon fibre.
That actually seems to be the target market - people who want it to
look nice, rather than those who want to go fast or carry anything.
It's not particularly elegant, light or streamlined, and it doesn't
appear to have any way to carry more than a wallet and cellphone.

That said, I'd love to test one... mostly because if some 102kg guy
has had a real go at it I'd like to know if I can meet the challenge.
Looking at it I suspect that heavy stop-start riding would see the
end of it within a Mm or two. But it would be fun to find out.

Amateurs with lots of money are a rare breed these days - it's nice to 
see one occasionally. And if they know anything about composite 
engineering so much the better. Their target market (style over 
substance) is actually the crowd who could most afford it. What an irony 
if that market lifted the bar on trike sales and prices...

I remember hearing a carbon fibre tube boom snap with a deafening crack 
at an HPV challenge back in the 90's - that would be a very expensive 
noise on this trike!

When/if I reach a 3rd-iteration prototype and have conceits of 
production-readiness, I'll give it to Moz to test, and inject a dose of 
reality.

I have built a new suspension trike. Like my last design, it uses Firestone
rolling lip airbag springs and a single rear damper. 
 
Front track 90cm, wheelbase 102cm, (loaded) seat height 34cm
 
Front suspension is unique: leading arm, torsion tube, beam axle with Watts
Link. Rear suspension is space-frame trailing arm.
 
7 inches rear travel, 6 inches front travel for single wheel bumps, 4 inches
for simultaneous two wheel bumps.
 
Front kingpins are Greenspeed GT3 mark 2 with their negative scrub radius,
swapped left to right. I run more static castor. Steering is a variation on
Greenspeed 'non-crossover' steering optimised for ratio, Ackermann and bump
steer.
 
Wheels are 16 inch. 
 
81 gears, front drum brakes, rear hydraulic disc brake. 
 
All chrome moly steel, nickel bronze brazed together. 
 
21.4kg 
 
Disassembles to package about 80 x 40 x 50cm.
 
First testing is very encouraging. Ride quality as good as previous (20 inch
wheel) design, steering better, maximum lateral cornering performance better
(10cm lower seat height). 
 
Next steps are a lot more testing, and construction of carrier, then testing
in fully loaded touring configuration. 
 
Pics of prototype ready for all that testing -

obviously at full droop in pics.)

Hello Julian,

lower and lighter, very good to enhance performance of a trike!

I am impressed by your work. At the beginning you were very determined about that a very advanced suspension was needed for good ride quality. So I was surprised when you launched the semitrailing arm front end, and now a beam axle! It gets worse and worse... get me right! =) I really like your approach. And this is a kind of basic science that we need.

I grew up with beam axle rear ends on cars (european brand). Watt link was a way to get it better, though I never built one myself. 

I may look closer to your design for a rear end of a delta trike that I plan to build.

/Bruno

Hi again,

I see that you use small wheels.

One inflamed debate is that of wheel size. A large wheel is said to give less drag on rough surface because it does not go as deep in the bumps as a small wheel. I can imagine that a suspension on a small wheel can do the same thing as a large wheel without suspension - but I really don't know. Does suspension even out the differences between small and large wheels in this respect? What is your opinion or experience about this?

Yes, the progression from double wishbones to semi-leading arms to a beam
axle has been an interesting learning experience. 

I am not backing away from that at all - at least I HAVE been able to learn!
Current system has best ride and handling, and easily lowest weight, of the
three different designs I have built.

Note: an equal gain in learning is the adoption of the Firestone airbags.

I have no opinion on rolling resistance per se - I have never done any
measurements of it and, to be honest, I don't really care much anyway. 

However, I am very interested in ride comfort from different sized wheels.
The 20 inch Greenspeeds clearly ride better than the 16 inch Greenspeeds.
When I found that out I resolved to use only 20 inch wheels on my designs.
But the Air 150 rode so incredibly well (especially when loaded for touring)
that I realised I could trade off a lot of ride comfort and still be happy.

Therefore for packaging reasons (ie the size of the disassembled package) I
went this time to 16 inch wheels, and kevlar banded tyres. I expected a
harsher ride but at this stage in my testing, ride comfort is actually
better (lower suspension pivot height on front helps), but there's a little
more high frequency vibration on coarse surfaces. 

I do not agree with the idea that wheels should be limited in droop so that
they don't 'catch' in holes - I again run about 40-50 per cent static
deflection (ie about half the travel used up when the trike is loaded - this
can easily be adjusted with the airbag springs). 

With decent suspension, I think that even 14 inch wheels would be fine.

Sorry, semileading was the correct term, sorry for that.

I think that the progression shows that your are more open minded than I gave you credit for at the beginning. Sorry for that too.

Another good thing with this development is that it shows that you can do a good job with less and lighter and less complicated parts. I guess the geometry is simpler too.

I can see that there is a potential to build this system very compact with narrow track and low CG. It can probably also be built to give good leg clearance in that case.

For instance, for comparison, my velomobile has got a very complicated suspension system that only gives a travel of 35 mm. It is a kind of multilink mcpherson system. The good thing with this system is that the seating position can be very low with good leg clearance and at the same time the wheels are kept snuggly within the bodywork. Seat height is only 15 cm.

Alex Moulton seemed to think small wheels with suspension were the

quantitative data he had to back that up, though.

One problem is that somehow you have to allow for the extra weight of
the large wheels, and the extra weight of the trike required to cope
with the larger forces from those wheels. A trike with 700c wheels is
an interesting beast to build, and the lightest one I recall seeing
was over 20kg (it was unsuspended).

A long time ago Ian at Greenspeed published a letter or notes on their
experience shifting from a 26" rear wheel to 20". From what I recall
he mostly focussed on the smaller wheel meaning shorter frame members,
and both those things meaning lighter tubing could be used, giving a
surprising reduction in weight as well as better wheel rigidity. My
experience with a 27" wheel quad at high school was that it destroyed
wheels with enthusiasm even when ridden carefully (it had a Cortina
bench seat so it wasn't really a speed machine).

So the reduction in rolling resistance would have to be dramatic to
compensate for the disadvantages. With a bike many of these problems
are vastly reduced if not eliminated, so the question is very
different.

Interesting thoughts.

Why I ask is because I want a trike that can take bad roads fairly well. In addition to Julians project I want to be able to take loose stuff like gravel, sand and snow on the road as well. That is why I design with delta as configuration - it may roll easier on loose ground because it is only one front wheel that turns and scrubs in the loose material - on a tadpole there are two of them possibly making it harder to push a tadpole through sand and snow.

Vel?mobiel.nl built a "SUV"-quest with 27" wheels. It had suspension and was said to roll easier at low speeds than the ones with 20" wheels, I have no quantitative data though and it did breake spokes with a strong rider in it. Also recumbists using two-wheelers often report that a recumbent with large wheels rolls and rides much better.

As I understand, one of the theories is that the smaller wheel has a steeper angle to the bump than the larger one. Hence a larger wheel rides better with lower rolling resistance on real roads. Testing on rollers may show different result but that is not interesting to me, it is the real situations that counts.

So, maybe a small suspended wheel will roll equally as well or superior to a  large one without suspension? Julians results may point in that direction regarding differences between his iterations. The problem is loose material. Maybe it can be compensated with using larger tyres? I can imagine that still a large diameter wheel is easier to push through a layer of snow, it rides more on that snow pressing it down than pushing through it like a smaller wheel would to to a greater extent.

What do you think? I am really interested in a trike that rides well in winter conditions and I experience my current unsuspended tadpole trike is hard to push through snow layers on the road.

I once had the chance to look at Mike Burrows' photo album of early 
Windcheetah trikes etc and there was one photo of an early trike with 
larger front wheels - the caption was "DON'T DO THIS AGAIN"

One option might be the 4" fat tyres used on chopper bikes that are
now available fairly cheaply. I have a pair for my quad and on sand
they work quite well - lower ground pressure so they float rather
than sinking into the sand. For snow/ice you'd probably want to put
studs through them.

You will need the special rims for those tyres, which means an extra
set of wheels. so perhaps also look at trials wheels and tyres

Julian,

The new trike looks great, I'll have to see if I can come and flip this
one over when I'm next back in oz (2 weeks!).

I did wonder, did you do anything to strengthen the 90* joints between
the cross bar and kingpin risers?  It seems like they would be under an
awful lot of load and I didn't see any external gussets.

Alex Moulton pointed out that with suspension, a tire could have a  
lighter casing because it was protected from bottoming out.   
Suspension pioneer Dan Henry ran the lightest track tires on the  
road.  Going over bumps, suspension is clearly superior, because the  
energy that goes into throwing the whole trike up is seldom recovered  
on the return to earth, whereas a suspended wheel works like a roller  
cam follower, and conserves energy.  (minus the shock absorber tax,  
and it's own weight, etc.)
The classical literature is based on steel wheels, and shows an  
inverse relationship between diameter and rolling resistance.  Double  
the diameter gives half the resistance, because there is less  
deformation.  On the road, the effect of bridging small holes, and  
rising slower over bumps is also important.  Narrow tires also have  
important aero benefits.
However, with pneumatic tires, what really matters is how much the  
tread scrubs on the road as it is forced to conform to it, and the  
hysterisis within the casing as this happens, and a long contact  
patch is not always optimum.  Unfortunately, much testing has been  
done on small rollers, which mask the effect of wheel diameter, so  
the data are inconclusive.  On a non-tilting wheel, the radial-belted  
tire construction as pioneered by Michelin is clearly the biggest  
improvement available, but most of the valuable test results are  
proprietary, and radial options rare.  I'm tempted to just get the  
lightest available tires, sand the tread off, and replace it with a  
multi-groove or timing belt, inside out.  The casing would be good  
for more pressure that way, but the belt might not stand it.
Suspension has no effect on breaking trail, at which a trike is  
always at a disadvantage compared to single or dual-track machines.   
Trikes also match the tire tracks of other vehicles poorly, so they  
break more trail and run on softer surfaces.  Having the center wheel  
more lightly loaded can average out better where ruts are a factor,  
but then you want 2 or 3WD.  On an electric hybrid, that's easy.   
Where snow turns to icy lumps, the usual suspension factors apply.
Wheel position, front or rear, has no effect on rolling resistance,  
except insofar as the load on it shifts with acceleration or  
braking.  If a more lightly loaded wheel "floats" while others dig  
in, you could make the others wider, but the pressure the tire exerts  
on  a soft surface is pretty much the same as the air pressure  
inside, so unless you are starting off with different casing sections  
and pressures, there should be little difference.
On soft surfaces, a large-diameter, narrow tire shows to advantage  
just as is the case with steel wheels, because once again, both the  
tire and the road are of more or less equal stiffness.  You must  
compress the roadbed until it can sustain the pressure, but with a  
long contact patch, you ride on it longer, instead of compressing yet  
more roadbed to the sides.

Best,
Bob Stuart

Thanks Bob.

It seems like my original idea, a delta trike with large wheels, is a good option for soft surfaces. The front wheel which steers and hence does the most skidding about in the loose material, is lightly loaded. I had only suspicion about that this would work better than my tadpole with 20" wheels, but now I have some more insight in this matter that this is true.

With large wheels I mean 559. The front wheel on the LWB delta is lightly loaded and is tilted in turns, so I suspect that it will take the beating pretty well.

However the rear wheels is another story. I still want 559 at the rear and I have seen delta velomobiles that uses such big wheels in that position, so it seems to be doable.

Any suggestions? Tilting the wheels with negative camber could be one way to cope with the forces? Heavier spokes?

For a large rear wheel, I just widened the hub.

I have deliberately left out all gussets (except a pair at the top of the
'T' of the front suspension arm). I want to see if anything on this
prototype breaks. 

You can also argue that the rear spaceframe needs more bracing, and that the
frame Watts Link support should be braced to the upper spring mounts. All
make sense; all would add weight.

Re flipping it over - I have been giving this one some 'dan testing' and if
you yank on full lock at speed, it can still occur.

Whether you're lifting an enitre wheel and trike out of a "hole" or lifting 
an entire wheel and compressing suspension, it's still energy loss.  A 
larger diameter wheel with all else being equal would be more efficient 
because it drops less.


Subject: [trikes] new suspension trike



Hi again,

I see that you use small wheels.

One inflamed debate is that of wheel size. A large wheel is said to give 
less drag on rough surface because it does not go as deep in the bumps as a 
small wheel. I can imagine that a suspension on a small wheel can do the 
same thing as a large wheel without suspension - but I really don't know. 
Does suspension even out the differences between small and large wheels in 
this respect? What is your opinion or experience about this?

Probably you are right. Anyway, it was substantially larger than 20".

Everything else can't be equal in this case, the larger wheel will make for a heavier and larger vehicle. But maybe the tradeoffs are worth it.

There was a red Dutch-owned Quest camped next to Our Gang prior to PBP '07. 
I *thought* the front wheels were 559s.

Thanks, Lewis, sounds great! Nothing is like hands on experience! Sounds like a reasonable size to me for a hub for that size, great that it works!

I have seen a site with designs like the DeltaWolf, they have been of great inspiration.

Fair enough.  I was also wondering about the joint at the bottom of the
front suspension arm, which appears to permit only vertical movement.

When in a single-wheel deflection, it would seem that there would need
to be some amount of torsional deflection of the suspension arm (on the
order of 10 degrees either direction at full bump if my math is right).

I also noted that this prototype does not have an anti-roll bar, though
from my observation above I would guess that it is fairly resistant to
roll as-is.

I'm interpreting this to mean that both of these issues are addressed by
using the main tube of the 'T' as a torsion spring, can you elaborate
more on the front suspension design?

Front Suspension Design

When looked down on from above, Chalky's front suspension is shaped like the
letter 'T'. The top of the 'T' is a solid axle that joins the two front
wheels, while the upright of the 'T' points towards the back of the machine.


Solid (beam) axles are widely regarded as being very low tech - suitable
only for agricultural machines like trucks. However, the use of a beam axle
in this application actually results in a very light-weight design. 

The upright of the 'T' is a torsion tube. It is pivoted at its base such
that the wheel axle can rise and fall, but twist (eg when the body rolls) is
resisted. That is, the torsion tube's pivot point is a horizontal axle, with
its axis at right-angles to the length of the car. 

To prevent the wheel axle moving laterally (ie by bending the torsion tube),
a Watts Link is placed at the mid-point of the beam axle. This prevents the
axle from moving sideways, while still allowing free vertical movement. 

Firestone model 4001 rolling-lip airbag springs are located a little inboard
of the 16 inch wheels. These air springs are light in weight, have no
stiction, can be easily optimised via internal pressure for differing load
carrying conditions, and can be mounted without the ends needing to stay
parallel through the full suspension movement.

This apparently simple suspension design is actually quite complex in the
way it works. Let's take a look.


.	Two-Wheel Bumps

Over two-wheel bumps (eg a speed hump), the front wheels rise and fall
together. That is, the wheel travel and the spring travel are the same (ie a
1:1 motion ratio). The spec'd travel of the air springs is 3.6 inches (but
in this front application I run them at about 3.8 inches), so over a
two-wheel bump, the maximum front suspension travel is 3.8 inches. 

Over this type of bump, the torsion tube acts just as a suspension member -
it doesn't twist. The Watts Link ensures the axle rises and falls without
any sideways movement.

Steering castor varies with wheel movement, with the castor increasing as
the suspension compresses.

.	One-Wheel Bump

Over a one-wheel bump (the vast majority of bumps - let's imagine a stone on
the road) a single wheel rises. 

Because the axle is supported at the opposite end by the other wheel, and
because the spring is mounted inboard from the rising wheel, and (finally)
because the torsion tube can twist (the inertial mass of the rider resists
being rotated, so the torsion tube twists instead), the compression of the
spring on a one-wheel bump is less than it would be for a two-wheel bump of
the same size. 

Therefore, compared with a two-wheel bump, the spring rate is effectively
lower, and the maximum travel is potentially higher - probably at least 6
inches.

In addition to the air spring, the torsion tube also resists the one-wheel
bump (remember, it acts as an anti-roll bar, and anti-roll bars resist
one-wheel bumps). One-wheel bumps attempt to cause some sideways movement of
the axle, but this is prevented by the Watts Link. When passing over a
one-wheel bump, the castor angles of the two front wheels no longer remain
the same. 

.	Cornering

When cornering, the body rolls. 

Resisting this is the air spring on the outer wheel and also the
longitudinal torsion tube. The spring has a slightly rising rate (it gets
stiffer as it is compressed more) but the torsion tube is linear in its
torsional behaviour. 

It's in cornering that the Watts Link is subject to its greatest forces,
with its action stopping the axle being pushed sideways. 

.	Dive

The suspension sees dive much like a two-wheel bump - the spring rate is
effectively higher than it is for one-wheel bumps. 


Other Characteristics

.	Steering Lock

Another characteristic of this suspension system is not in its behaviour but
in its shape - there is a lot of room for steering lock to occur.

.	Spring Motion Ratios

As implied above, the spring motion ratios are kept low. Compared with
motion ratios where the spring moves far less than the wheel, this approach
reduces bending stresses in the suspension arms. In the case of the air
springs, it also allows a lower inflation pressure to be used (giving better
headroom to the max allowable pressure, and so also permitting the machine
to cope with bigger load variations). 

.	Lightness

This suspension design uses about 25 per cent less tube than the Air 150's
semi-leading arm design.  The front suspension arm, complete with Watts Link
and rear bearings, weighs 1.7kg. With the two air springs, this rises by 700
grams for a total of 2.4kg.


Shortcomings

The leading, torsion tube, beam axle with Watts Link design also has some
shortcomings. 

Firstly, this suspension design doesn't have a dynamic negative camber
increase on bump - that is, the outer loaded wheel does not adopt negative
camber during cornering. 

But, in fact, it actually does! 

This is achieved not by the suspension but by the steering, that runs a lot
of castor and so automatically develops neg camber when steering lock is
applied. Furthermore, as the outer spring is compressed in cornering, so the
castor (and therefore neg camber) increases. 

It's impossible to have a beam axle and have track change with suspension
travel, so once a beam axle was decided upon, track-change damping as an
option went out the window. Damping on Chalky will either be via hydraulic
damper(s) - or no damping used at all. Initial testing indicates that
dampers may not be needed (in part because the natural frequency of the
suspension is so low, and so it is less easily excited by short-spaced
bumps.)

Having the steering wheels on the one axle also has the potential to give
bad steering shimmy, a problem that often occurred in cars of the 1920s and
1930s equipped with solid front axles. (It also can occur in unusual bicycle
designs.) However, shimmying always seems to be able to be overcome, either
by revising stiffness of bushes (etc), or by changing the steering stiffness
and/or geometry. I also wonder if shimmy of those old cars wasn't
exacerbated by the zero scrub radius, low castor angles and positive camber
then often adopted. 

The roll centre of the suspension is low. This was required for packaging
purposes, but it also means that the amount of body roll that occurs for a
given cornering force is higher than it would be if the roll centre was
further above the ground. 

Finally, the pitch centre is also low - which could cause dive problems when
braking (but at least dive is resisted by both springs) and allow rear
suspension extension, again when braking.

Fair enough.  I was also wondering about the joint at the bottom of the
front suspension arm, which appears to permit only vertical movement.

When in a single-wheel deflection, it would seem that there would need
to be some amount of torsional deflection of the suspension arm (on the
order of 10 degrees either direction at full bump if my math is right).

I also noted that this prototype does not have an anti-roll bar, though
from my observation above I would guess that it is fairly resistant to
roll as-is.

I'm interpreting this to mean that both of these issues are addressed by
using the main tube of the 'T' as a torsion spring, can you elaborate
more on the front suspension design?

Very clever, indeed! It is so great that this design seems to work well.

The old european cars with rear beam axle I referred to eariler did not have watts link from factory, it could be bought from hot tuning shops. The original solution on these cars was "panhard" or transversal bar, a simpler solution than the watts link with only two bearings but it did cause the rear axle to move slightly sideways during spring movement.

Panhard rod would also have required a strong frame mount at extreme edge of
frame, and calculated weight was higher as long length of unsupported tube
needs to be larger in diameter than tube used in watts Link.

Hi Julian,

Thanks for the data elsewhere on your static deflection being about  
40 - 50%.  I wonder how much loading the air springs take to reach  
100%?  You seem to have a useful refinement on the practise of using  
soft springs and tall rubber bump stops.  How much do the bags cost?   
With a rising rate spring, you are protected from resonance on  
washboard surfaces except during acceleration, because the resonant  
frequency increases with amplitude.  If you should wish to add some  
damping, a nice spandex sleeve over the Firestones should manage to  
rub somewhere.

I don't understand how you sometimes get different caster angles on  
each end of the front axle.  I'd see if if you were using two  
traditional style links, and twisting the axle beam in between them  
as is often done, but on this layout, the kingpins seem to move  
together, in my mind.

I don't think there is any reason to bother with niggling niceties of  
negative camber unless a tire tread is wide enough to be  
disadvantaged by running at a slight angle.  Tires derived from  
bicycles have much in hand in this regard.  The simplicity and  
lightness of solid axles has kept them current in some branches of  
racing continuously.  On the front end, though, they are subject not  
just to shimmy, but the original, grandaddy Axle Tramp, which tears  
the steering wheel from a driver's hands, and leaves alternating  
crescents of rubber on the road, like a giant's footsteps.  This can  
be set off by a pebble on a smooth road, and involves the gyroscopic  
couple of the wheels as the axle rotates in roll, lifting the front  
end.  The cure was simply to reduce the stiffness of the steering  
linkage between the wheels, which is usually handy for clearance,  
too, so people forget how important it can be.

Kudos for keeping the gussets out of a location where they only look  
right, bother the air, and add weight, and for minimizing the forces  
on the springs.  Structure should always have leverage on its side,  
unless the deflections can be useful.

Best,
Bob Stuart

An organization which maintains an image of perfection will find

Hi Julian,
 
Thanks for the data elsewhere on your static deflection being about 40 -
50%.  I wonder how much loading the air springs take to reach 100%?  
 
[I am damned if I know! When I first tested them on the bench I thought they
had a rising rate. But subsequently they don't appear to, except perhaps
over the very, very last part of the travel. Having said that, if set
correctly in pressure and motion ratio, you never bottom them out - I don't
run bump stops at all. I was carrying test loads of 45kg on the back of the
machine today, with air pressure suitably revised. ]
 
 
You seem to have a useful refinement on the practise of using soft springs
and tall rubber bump stops.  How much do the bags cost?  
 
[Cost varies enormously depending on where you live - they're cheap in the
US, but I can't give you a price. Here in Australia my first lot were
AUD$300 each, but after I saw the US price I got a VERY much cheaper local
deal and bought a bunch of them at the same time.]
 
With a rising rate spring, you are protected from resonance on washboard
surfaces except during acceleration, because the resonant frequency
increases with amplitude.  If you should wish to add some damping, a nice
spandex sleeve over the Firestones should manage to rub somewhere. 
 
[Interesting idea]

links, and twisting the axle beam in between them as is often done, but on

[yes, you're right. (Thanks, I can change the AutoSpeed story before it's
published!).]

Yes, that is the one I meant, I saw it on other pictures, I think from the trip mentioned. With a very strong rider the spokes were not up to the task, but later owner had no problems with spokes breaking, so either he did something about it or he is not as fast.

Hi Folks,

It's time to shake off the Winter doldrums and celebrate Human Power 
(and the Spring!!!)

The '09 New England HPV Rally will be held on Saturday, May 9, 2009 in 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire in conjunction with the Portsmouth 
Sustainability Fair.  Details can be found on the events page at 
www.wildfirehpv.com

If previous events are any guide, we should have a good range of 
different human powered vehicles, including commercially built and 
homebuilt velomobiles, human/electric hybrids (past events included a 
solar powered upright built mostly from junk!) and a wide range of 
different recumbents.


Hope to see you there!

Best,

Last week I covered the description of the frame and seat, and said that I
was about to start some serious testing. So what did that testing involve -
and what were the results?


Since Chalky's major purpose in life is to be a touring machine, the first
major testing was to load up the beast. Not having yet built the rear
carrier, I used the one from my Air 150 recumbent trike - this fitted
straight on. 

I then attached two Arkel RT40 panniers and loaded them and the carrier with
no less than 43kg of water, contained in plastic bladders and a plastic
container. The load of 43kg is a LOT - I expect my normal touring load to be
under 30kg, so 43kg represents a 30 per cent overload. 

The test course was out of my workshop onto the front yard (a 60mm step),
across the bumpy yard and then around the bitumen cul de sac on which I
live, running at times onto the bumpy dirt verge. 

But I didn't get as far as the bitumen - an ugly sound occurred from
underneath and I found that the front of the rear suspension arm had spread
a little, allowing one of the two bearing carriers to pop off the bearing. I
added a brace to tie the front of the rear suspension space-frame together,
then went testing again, still with the 43kg extra load.

This time all seemed fine over the bumps.

Throwing the machine around (two wheeling, full steering lock at speed, hard
braking) showed that the extra 'touring' weight was located higher than
desirable: the trike rolled a fair bit and, moreover, could be provoked into
lurching with the weight transfer. Clearly, the borrowed carrier was
positioning the loads higher than they needed to be, so making the correct
carrier became a priority. However, how would the machine handle at speed,
even with the loads mounted so high?

I rode some local roads - very steep and bumpy bitumen. At speed over long
wavelength, low amplitude bumps, the trike could develop a corkscrewing
motion - the lack of roll damping, and the lack of front suspension damping,
making themselves felt. 

Under front-wheel braking, even with the touring load (but worse without
it), the rear suspension extended abruptly - more rebound damping was
needed. 

But these were about the only dynamic deficiencies.  

Over sharp bumps the ride comfort was extremely good. With the heavy load,
tyre pressures needed to be high (otherwise tyre scrub, especially of the
back tyre, occurred in really hard cornering), but the steering was good and
there was none of the twitchiness that could characterise the Air 150
running similar loads.

The next test was to ride the flat cycle paths and roads of the Gold Coast,
pulling a trailer with my four year old son Alexander in it. I used a
Chariot Cougar 1 child trailer; Alexander weighs 19kg. The trailer draw bar
was attached to the rear wheel of the trike, not the suspended frame. 

In this form the trailer towed well, but at full speed, the direct
connection of the draw-bar to the rear wheel could be felt to be steering
the trike a little. That is, any yaw of the trailer was directly transferred
to the rear wheel. The ~3kg downforce of the drawbar also effectively added
to the unsprung mass, giving a poorer rear wheel ride, especially over
short, sharp bumps. 

The trailer obviously needed to be connected to the main (suspended) frame,
not the wheel.

After this ride, the next day I had a slightly sore neck and shoulders - the
seat was a bit too reclined for my best comfort.

So this testing showed that needed were:

.	a new towbar
.	a new carrier
.	less reclined seat
.	more rear damper rebound damping


I revised the rear spring and damper mounts to position the seat in a more
upright position. This also placed more of the mass between the front
wheels. I refilled the damper with more viscous oil. 

I then went testing. Both because of the more forwards weight bias and the
more upright seat (in which I felt more comfortable), I found I could throw
the machine around quite phenomenally. I haven't yet measured max lateral
acceleration but I would think it's the highest of any recumbent trike I
have ridden. 

In fact, to get it up on two wheels and hold it there I found quite
difficult. 

However, by swerving dementedly back and forth I could throw it from being
up on two wheels on one side, to two wheels on the other side, alternating
back and forth, one side of the front suspension compressing hard each time
a wheel came back to earth.

This is obviously immensely hard on the structure of the trike - and
something failed!

The rearwards mount for the front suspension - through which all the
anti-roll forces are fed - started to crush the main tube and the braze weld
to fail. I'd thought that the long length of the brackets would spread the
load sufficiently - but that was not the case.

More work needed!

Hi Julian,
 
Thanks for the data elsewhere on your static deflection being about 40 -
50%.  I wonder how much loading the air springs take to reach 100%?  
 
[I am damned if I know! When I first tested them on the bench I thought they
had a rising rate. But subsequently they don't appear to, except perhaps
over the very, very last part of the travel. Having said that, if set
correctly in pressure and motion ratio, you never bottom them out - I don't
run bump stops at all. I was carrying test loads of 45kg on the back of the
machine today, with air pressure suitably revised. ]
 
 
You seem to have a useful refinement on the practise of using soft springs
and tall rubber bump stops.  How much do the bags cost?  
 
[Cost varies enormously depending on where you live - they're cheap in the
US, but I can't give you a price. Here in Australia my first lot were
AUD$300 each, but after I saw the US price I got a VERY much cheaper local
deal and bought a bunch of them at the same time.]
 
With a rising rate spring, you are protected from resonance on washboard
surfaces except during acceleration, because the resonant frequency
increases with amplitude.  If you should wish to add some damping, a nice
spandex sleeve over the Firestones should manage to rub somewhere. 
 
[Interesting idea]
 
I don't understand how you sometimes get different caster angles on each end
of the front axle.  I'd see if if you were using two traditional style
links, and twisting the axle beam in between them as is often done, but on
this layout, the kingpins seem to move together, in my mind.
 
[yes, you're right. (Thanks, I can change the AutoSpeed story before it's
published!).]
 
I don't think there is any reason to bother with niggling niceties of
negative camber unless a tire tread is wide enough to be disadvantaged by
running at a slight angle.  Tires derived from bicycles have much in hand in
this regard.  The simplicity and lightness of solid axles has kept them
current in some branches of racing continuously.  On the front end, though,
they are subject not just to shimmy, but the original, grandaddy Axle Tramp,
which tears the steering wheel from a driver's hands, and leaves alternating
crescents of rubber on the road, like a giant's footsteps.  This can be set
off by a pebble on a smooth road, and involves the gyroscopic couple of the
wheels as the axle rotates in roll, lifting the front end.  The cure was
simply to reduce the stiffness of the steering linkage between the wheels,
which is usually handy for clearance, too, so people forget how important it
can be.
 
Kudos for keeping the gussets out of a location where they only look right,
bother the air, and add weight, and for minimizing the forces on the
springs.  Structure should always have leverage on its side, unless the
deflections can be useful.
 
Best,
Bob Stuart
 
An organization which maintains an image of perfection will find itself
unable to even be good.

Just a diversion from all the suspension action: it's apparent that 
people like a wide range of seat angles. Some trikes are really laid 
back and others are much more upright. Julian's looked very upright 
compared to my favoured position, but now he calls it too reclined!

What do people like, and can they say why? I always liked seats to be 
very laid back, but there's been talk of the best hill-climbing 
positions being more upright, from the 2-wheel world.

I've often dreamed of an on-the-fly-adjustable linkage to adjust the 
seat to suit both climbing and flat country...

Before I built our greenspeed GTEs we tried every seat angle we could

 This may not be the most aero of positions, but its comfortable and

 I found the more laid back positions gave me a sore neck as my chin was

 This is the opposite of wedgie touring (relax and your staring at the

I was sure i wawnted a very reclined position when i bought my GTO and was
midly disappointed it wasn't longer and lower, but I don't feel that way at
all 7 sears or so later.

No equivocation: I like the E seat on my GTO.  Because it is a bungee'd mesh
seat it is very compliant.  You can push here and there from butt to
shoulders and create many configurations on the fly (can you do that with a
hard seat?).  So it is a simple thing to get more recline or sit more
upright - as long as the X seam you create works for there particular
situation.  I suppose that the actual angle of recline is not changing very
much, but it feels like large changes, and all seem useful.

I will tighten the back area by forcing my rear to sink and use this more
upright form when on a climb, and I tend to slouch and slide my butt forward
on long easy flats.

I think the GS E seat is a master piece. 43 degrees paid off big time IMO.

I also have a couple 2 wheel bents.  The Linear has a lot of seat adjustment
and I have been able to try out a more reclined position with it.  I think I
breath better sitting upright.  I have good breathing habits when working
hard and if my head is inclined forward it is obvious my ability to
ventilate is decreased.  I definitely have more total force when upright and
lean forward for hard pushing on steep grades (also seen on the 2 wheel
bents).

Julian's trike is not purely a road bike.  His target road mix tends to
rougher than most of us ride and maybe with steeper grades. His comment on
relcine makes sense in this regard.  Probably there are kinesthetic gains in
power generated, conrtrol of the trikes attitude, visibility, and so on.

Nice trike Julian.  Informed by automobile designs, but quite different.
Looks you are on to something new, different, and nice.  Weight down -
nicely done.

A few sequences were actually shot on high speed motor drive (5 frames a
second) that look even more exciting. One thing that makes it easier than a
non suspension trike to ride like this is that each wheel 'landing' is soft.
