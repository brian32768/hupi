<PRE>On a recent trip, the touring company dropped our GS tandem off the roof of  
its van.  We were able to make it ridable, but it is definitely tweaked,  with 
some scrapes as well.  The trike has about 2000 miles on it, and is  about 3 
years old, with 5 S&amp;S couplings.
 
Anyway, we have new tandem on order, because we don't feel we can rely on  
this one to take us across the USA.
 
I would like to donate this trike to a charity in the Los Angeles  area.  I 
think an institute that works with the blind could make great use  of it.   
With a sighted captain, a blind stoker could have a lot of  fun.  The trike would 
be fine for day trips. Maybe Ronald MacDonald  house?
 
We would be grateful for any suggestions or connections to a legitimate  
charity venue.  Any thoughts?
 
Thanks, Keith in Los Angeles
