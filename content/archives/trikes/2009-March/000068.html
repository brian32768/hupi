<PRE>Last week I covered the description of the frame and seat, and said that I
was about to start some serious testing. So what did that testing involve -
and what were the results?


Since Chalky's major purpose in life is to be a touring machine, the first
major testing was to load up the beast. Not having yet built the rear
carrier, I used the one from my Air 150 recumbent trike - this fitted
straight on. 

I then attached two Arkel RT40 panniers and loaded them and the carrier with
no less than 43kg of water, contained in plastic bladders and a plastic
container. The load of 43kg is a LOT - I expect my normal touring load to be
under 30kg, so 43kg represents a 30 per cent overload. 

The test course was out of my workshop onto the front yard (a 60mm step),
across the bumpy yard and then around the bitumen cul de sac on which I
live, running at times onto the bumpy dirt verge. 

But I didn't get as far as the bitumen - an ugly sound occurred from
underneath and I found that the front of the rear suspension arm had spread
a little, allowing one of the two bearing carriers to pop off the bearing. I
added a brace to tie the front of the rear suspension space-frame together,
then went testing again, still with the 43kg extra load.

This time all seemed fine over the bumps.

Throwing the machine around (two wheeling, full steering lock at speed, hard
braking) showed that the extra 'touring' weight was located higher than
desirable: the trike rolled a fair bit and, moreover, could be provoked into
lurching with the weight transfer. Clearly, the borrowed carrier was
positioning the loads higher than they needed to be, so making the correct
carrier became a priority. However, how would the machine handle at speed,
even with the loads mounted so high?

I rode some local roads - very steep and bumpy bitumen. At speed over long
wavelength, low amplitude bumps, the trike could develop a corkscrewing
motion - the lack of roll damping, and the lack of front suspension damping,
making themselves felt. 

Under front-wheel braking, even with the touring load (but worse without
it), the rear suspension extended abruptly - more rebound damping was
needed. 

But these were about the only dynamic deficiencies.  

Over sharp bumps the ride comfort was extremely good. With the heavy load,
tyre pressures needed to be high (otherwise tyre scrub, especially of the
back tyre, occurred in really hard cornering), but the steering was good and
there was none of the twitchiness that could characterise the Air 150
running similar loads.

The next test was to ride the flat cycle paths and roads of the Gold Coast,
pulling a trailer with my four year old son Alexander in it. I used a
Chariot Cougar 1 child trailer; Alexander weighs 19kg. The trailer draw bar
was attached to the rear wheel of the trike, not the suspended frame. 

In this form the trailer towed well, but at full speed, the direct
connection of the draw-bar to the rear wheel could be felt to be steering
the trike a little. That is, any yaw of the trailer was directly transferred
to the rear wheel. The ~3kg downforce of the drawbar also effectively added
to the unsprung mass, giving a poorer rear wheel ride, especially over
short, sharp bumps. 

The trailer obviously needed to be connected to the main (suspended) frame,
not the wheel.

After this ride, the next day I had a slightly sore neck and shoulders - the
seat was a bit too reclined for my best comfort.

So this testing showed that needed were:

.	a new towbar
.	a new carrier
.	less reclined seat
.	more rear damper rebound damping


I revised the rear spring and damper mounts to position the seat in a more
upright position. This also placed more of the mass between the front
wheels. I refilled the damper with more viscous oil. 

I then went testing. Both because of the more forwards weight bias and the
more upright seat (in which I felt more comfortable), I found I could throw
the machine around quite phenomenally. I haven't yet measured max lateral
acceleration but I would think it's the highest of any recumbent trike I
have ridden. 

In fact, to get it up on two wheels and hold it there I found quite
difficult. 

However, by swerving dementedly back and forth I could throw it from being
up on two wheels on one side, to two wheels on the other side, alternating
back and forth, one side of the front suspension compressing hard each time
a wheel came back to earth.

This is obviously immensely hard on the structure of the trike - and
something failed!

The rearwards mount for the front suspension - through which all the
anti-roll forces are fed - started to crush the main tube and the braze weld
to fail. I'd thought that the long length of the brackets would spread the
load sufficiently - but that was not the case.

More work needed!

Hi Julian,
 
Thanks for the data elsewhere on your static deflection being about 40 -
50%.  I wonder how much loading the air springs take to reach 100%?  
 
[I am damned if I know! When I first tested them on the bench I thought they
had a rising rate. But subsequently they don't appear to, except perhaps
over the very, very last part of the travel. Having said that, if set
correctly in pressure and motion ratio, you never bottom them out - I don't
run bump stops at all. I was carrying test loads of 45kg on the back of the
machine today, with air pressure suitably revised. ]
 
 
You seem to have a useful refinement on the practise of using soft springs
and tall rubber bump stops.  How much do the bags cost?  
 
[Cost varies enormously depending on where you live - they're cheap in the
US, but I can't give you a price. Here in Australia my first lot were
AUD$300 each, but after I saw the US price I got a VERY much cheaper local
deal and bought a bunch of them at the same time.]
 
With a rising rate spring, you are protected from resonance on washboard
surfaces except during acceleration, because the resonant frequency
increases with amplitude.  If you should wish to add some damping, a nice
spandex sleeve over the Firestones should manage to rub somewhere. 
 
[Interesting idea]
 
I don't understand how you sometimes get different caster angles on each end
of the front axle.  I'd see if if you were using two traditional style
links, and twisting the axle beam in between them as is often done, but on
this layout, the kingpins seem to move together, in my mind.
 
[yes, you're right. (Thanks, I can change the AutoSpeed story before it's
published!).]
 
I don't think there is any reason to bother with niggling niceties of
negative camber unless a tire tread is wide enough to be disadvantaged by
running at a slight angle.  Tires derived from bicycles have much in hand in
this regard.  The simplicity and lightness of solid axles has kept them
current in some branches of racing continuously.  On the front end, though,
they are subject not just to shimmy, but the original, grandaddy Axle Tramp,
which tears the steering wheel from a driver's hands, and leaves alternating
crescents of rubber on the road, like a giant's footsteps.  This can be set
off by a pebble on a smooth road, and involves the gyroscopic couple of the
wheels as the axle rotates in roll, lifting the front end.  The cure was
simply to reduce the stiffness of the steering linkage between the wheels,
which is usually handy for clearance, too, so people forget how important it
can be.
 
Kudos for keeping the gussets out of a location where they only look right,
bother the air, and add weight, and for minimizing the forces on the
springs.  Structure should always have leverage on its side, unless the
deflections can be useful.
 
Best,
Bob Stuart
 
An organization which maintains an image of perfection will find itself
unable to even be good.
