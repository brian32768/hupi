<PRE>Before I built our greenspeed GTEs we tried every seat angle we could 
find, and settled on 43 Deg.
 This may not be the most aero of positions, but its comfortable and 
gives a good view.
 I found the more laid back positions gave me a sore neck as my chin was 
as low as I could get it (if I relaxed I was looking at sky)
 This is the opposite of wedgie touring (relax and your staring at the 
road).
 
Cheers

 &gt; Just a diversion from all the suspension action: it's apparent that
 &gt; people like a wide range of seat angles. Some trikes are really laid
 &gt; back and others are much more upright. Julian's looked very upright
 &gt; compared to my favoured position, but now he calls it too reclined!
 &gt;
 &gt; What do people like, and can they say why? I always liked seats to be
 &gt; very laid back, but there's been talk of the best hill-climbing
 &gt; positions being more upright, from the 2-wheel world.
 &gt;
 &gt; I've often dreamed of an on-the-fly-adjustable linkage to adjust the
 &gt; seat to suit both climbing and flat country...
