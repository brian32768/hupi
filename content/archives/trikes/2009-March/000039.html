Interesting thoughts.

Why I ask is because I want a trike that can take bad roads fairly well. In addition to Julians project I want to be able to take loose stuff like gravel, sand and snow on the road as well. That is why I design with delta as configuration - it may roll easier on loose ground because it is only one front wheel that turns and scrubs in the loose material - on a tadpole there are two of them possibly making it harder to push a tadpole through sand and snow.

Vel&#246;mobiel.nl built a &quot;SUV&quot;-quest with 27&quot; wheels. It had suspension and was said to roll easier at low speeds than the ones with 20&quot; wheels, I have no quantitative data though and it did breake spokes with a strong rider in it. Also recumbists using two-wheelers often report that a recumbent with large wheels rolls and rides much better.

As I understand, one of the theories is that the smaller wheel has a steeper angle to the bump than the larger one. Hence a larger wheel rides better with lower rolling resistance on real roads. Testing on rollers may show different result but that is not interesting to me, it is the real situations that counts.

So, maybe a small suspended wheel will roll equally as well or superior to a  large one without suspension? Julians results may point in that direction regarding differences between his iterations. The problem is loose material. Maybe it can be compensated with using larger tyres? I can imagine that still a large diameter wheel is easier to push through a layer of snow, it rides more on that snow pressing it down than pushing through it like a smaller wheel would to to a greater extent.

What do you think? I am really interested in a trike that rides well in winter conditions and I experience my current unsuspended tadpole trike is hard to push through snow layers on the road.
