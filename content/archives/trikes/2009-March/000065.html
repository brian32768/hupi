Hi Julian,
 
Thanks for the data elsewhere on your static deflection being about 40 -
50%.  I wonder how much loading the air springs take to reach 100%?  
 
[I am damned if I know! When I first tested them on the bench I thought they
had a rising rate. But subsequently they don't appear to, except perhaps
over the very, very last part of the travel. Having said that, if set
correctly in pressure and motion ratio, you never bottom them out - I don't
run bump stops at all. I was carrying test loads of 45kg on the back of the
machine today, with air pressure suitably revised. ]
 
 
You seem to have a useful refinement on the practise of using soft springs
and tall rubber bump stops.  How much do the bags cost?  
 
[Cost varies enormously depending on where you live - they're cheap in the
US, but I can't give you a price. Here in Australia my first lot were
AUD$300 each, but after I saw the US price I got a VERY much cheaper local
deal and bought a bunch of them at the same time.]
 
With a rising rate spring, you are protected from resonance on washboard
surfaces except during acceleration, because the resonant frequency
increases with amplitude.  If you should wish to add some damping, a nice
spandex sleeve over the Firestones should manage to rub somewhere. 
 
[Interesting idea]
 
I don't understand how you sometimes get different caster angles on each end
of the front axle.  I'd see if if you were using two traditional style
links, and twisting the axle beam in between them as is often done, but on
this layout, the kingpins seem to move together, in my mind.
 
[yes, you're right. (Thanks, I can change the AutoSpeed story before it's
published!).]
 
I don't think there is any reason to bother with niggling niceties of
negative camber unless a tire tread is wide enough to be disadvantaged by
running at a slight angle.  Tires derived from bicycles have much in hand in
this regard.  The simplicity and lightness of solid axles has kept them
current in some branches of racing continuously.  On the front end, though,
they are subject not just to shimmy, but the original, grandaddy Axle Tramp,
which tears the steering wheel from a driver's hands, and leaves alternating
crescents of rubber on the road, like a giant's footsteps.  This can be set
off by a pebble on a smooth road, and involves the gyroscopic couple of the
wheels as the axle rotates in roll, lifting the front end.  The cure was
simply to reduce the stiffness of the steering linkage between the wheels,
which is usually handy for clearance, too, so people forget how important it
can be.
 
Kudos for keeping the gussets out of a location where they only look right,
bother the air, and add weight, and for minimizing the forces on the
springs.  Structure should always have leverage on its side, unless the
deflections can be useful.
 
Best,
Bob Stuart
 
An organization which maintains an image of perfection will find itself
unable to even be good.
