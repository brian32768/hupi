<PRE>I was sure i wawnted a very reclined position when i bought my GTO and was
midly disappointed it wasn't longer and lower, but I don't feel that way at
all 7 sears or so later.

No equivocation: I like the E seat on my GTO.  Because it is a bungee'd mesh
seat it is very compliant.  You can push here and there from butt to
shoulders and create many configurations on the fly (can you do that with a
hard seat?).  So it is a simple thing to get more recline or sit more
upright - as long as the X seam you create works for there particular
situation.  I suppose that the actual angle of recline is not changing very
much, but it feels like large changes, and all seem useful.

I will tighten the back area by forcing my rear to sink and use this more
upright form when on a climb, and I tend to slouch and slide my butt forward
on long easy flats.

I think the GS E seat is a master piece. 43 degrees paid off big time IMO.

I also have a couple 2 wheel bents.  The Linear has a lot of seat adjustment
and I have been able to try out a more reclined position with it.  I think I
breath better sitting upright.  I have good breathing habits when working
hard and if my head is inclined forward it is obvious my ability to
ventilate is decreased.  I definitely have more total force when upright and
lean forward for hard pushing on steep grades (also seen on the 2 wheel
bents).

Julian's trike is not purely a road bike.  His target road mix tends to
rougher than most of us ride and maybe with steeper grades. His comment on
relcine makes sense in this regard.  Probably there are kinesthetic gains in
power generated, conrtrol of the trikes attitude, visibility, and so on.

Nice trike Julian.  Informed by automobile designs, but quite different.
Looks you are on to something new, different, and nice.  Weight down -
nicely done.
