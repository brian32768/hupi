Alex Moulton pointed out that with suspension, a tire could have a  
lighter casing because it was protected from bottoming out.   
Suspension pioneer Dan Henry ran the lightest track tires on the  
road.  Going over bumps, suspension is clearly superior, because the  
energy that goes into throwing the whole trike up is seldom recovered  
on the return to earth, whereas a suspended wheel works like a roller  
cam follower, and conserves energy.  (minus the shock absorber tax,  
and it's own weight, etc.)
The classical literature is based on steel wheels, and shows an  
inverse relationship between diameter and rolling resistance.  Double  
the diameter gives half the resistance, because there is less  
deformation.  On the road, the effect of bridging small holes, and  
rising slower over bumps is also important.  Narrow tires also have  
important aero benefits.
However, with pneumatic tires, what really matters is how much the  
tread scrubs on the road as it is forced to conform to it, and the  
hysterisis within the casing as this happens, and a long contact  
patch is not always optimum.  Unfortunately, much testing has been  
done on small rollers, which mask the effect of wheel diameter, so  
the data are inconclusive.  On a non-tilting wheel, the radial-belted  
tire construction as pioneered by Michelin is clearly the biggest  
improvement available, but most of the valuable test results are  
proprietary, and radial options rare.  I'm tempted to just get the  
lightest available tires, sand the tread off, and replace it with a  
multi-groove or timing belt, inside out.  The casing would be good  
for more pressure that way, but the belt might not stand it.
Suspension has no effect on breaking trail, at which a trike is  
always at a disadvantage compared to single or dual-track machines.   
Trikes also match the tire tracks of other vehicles poorly, so they  
break more trail and run on softer surfaces.  Having the center wheel  
more lightly loaded can average out better where ruts are a factor,  
but then you want 2 or 3WD.  On an electric hybrid, that's easy.   
Where snow turns to icy lumps, the usual suspension factors apply.
Wheel position, front or rear, has no effect on rolling resistance,  
except insofar as the load on it shifts with acceleration or  
braking.  If a more lightly loaded wheel &quot;floats&quot; while others dig  
in, you could make the others wider, but the pressure the tire exerts  
on  a soft surface is pretty much the same as the air pressure  
inside, so unless you are starting off with different casing sections  
and pressures, there should be little difference.
On soft surfaces, a large-diameter, narrow tire shows to advantage  
just as is the case with steel wheels, because once again, both the  
tire and the road are of more or less equal stiffness.  You must  
compress the roadbed until it can sustain the pressure, but with a  
long contact patch, you ride on it longer, instead of compressing yet  
more roadbed to the sides.

Best,
Bob Stuart

Kudos to Julian, and thanks to my UPS, which saved 90% of this message.
