<PRE>Hi Julian,

Thanks for the data elsewhere on your static deflection being about  
40 - 50%.  I wonder how much loading the air springs take to reach  
100%?  You seem to have a useful refinement on the practise of using  
soft springs and tall rubber bump stops.  How much do the bags cost?   
With a rising rate spring, you are protected from resonance on  
washboard surfaces except during acceleration, because the resonant  
frequency increases with amplitude.  If you should wish to add some  
damping, a nice spandex sleeve over the Firestones should manage to  
rub somewhere.

I don't understand how you sometimes get different caster angles on  
each end of the front axle.  I'd see if if you were using two  
traditional style links, and twisting the axle beam in between them  
as is often done, but on this layout, the kingpins seem to move  
together, in my mind.

I don't think there is any reason to bother with niggling niceties of  
negative camber unless a tire tread is wide enough to be  
disadvantaged by running at a slight angle.  Tires derived from  
bicycles have much in hand in this regard.  The simplicity and  
lightness of solid axles has kept them current in some branches of  
racing continuously.  On the front end, though, they are subject not  
just to shimmy, but the original, grandaddy Axle Tramp, which tears  
the steering wheel from a driver's hands, and leaves alternating  
crescents of rubber on the road, like a giant's footsteps.  This can  
be set off by a pebble on a smooth road, and involves the gyroscopic  
couple of the wheels as the axle rotates in roll, lifting the front  
end.  The cure was simply to reduce the stiffness of the steering  
linkage between the wheels, which is usually handy for clearance,  
too, so people forget how important it can be.

Kudos for keeping the gussets out of a location where they only look  
right, bother the air, and add weight, and for minimizing the forces  
on the springs.  Structure should always have leverage on its side,  
unless the deflections can be useful.

Best,
Bob Stuart

An organization which maintains an image of perfection will find  
itself unable to even be good.

</I>&gt;<i> Front Suspension Design

</I>&gt;<i> When looked down on from above, Chalky's front suspension is shaped  
</I>&gt;<i> like the
</I>&gt;<i> letter 'T'. The top of the 'T' is a solid axle that joins the two  
</I>&gt;<i> front
</I>&gt;<i> wheels, while the upright of the 'T' points towards the back of the  
</I>&gt;<i> machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Solid (beam) axles are widely regarded as being very low tech -  
</I>&gt;<i> suitable
</I>&gt;<i> only for agricultural machines like trucks. However, the use of a  
</I>&gt;<i> beam axle
</I>&gt;<i> in this application actually results in a very light-weight design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The upright of the 'T' is a torsion tube. It is pivoted at its base  
</I>&gt;<i> such
</I>&gt;<i> that the wheel axle can rise and fall, but twist (eg when the body  
</I>&gt;<i> rolls) is
</I>&gt;<i> resisted. That is, the torsion tube's pivot point is a horizontal  
</I>&gt;<i> axle, with
</I>&gt;<i> its axis at right-angles to the length of the car.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To prevent the wheel axle moving laterally (ie by bending the  
</I>&gt;<i> torsion tube),
</I>&gt;<i> a Watts Link is placed at the mid-point of the beam axle. This  
</I>&gt;<i> prevents the
</I>&gt;<i> axle from moving sideways, while still allowing free vertical  
</I>&gt;<i> movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firestone model 4001 rolling-lip airbag springs are located a  
</I>&gt;<i> little inboard
</I>&gt;<i> of the 16 inch wheels. These air springs are light in weight, have no
</I>&gt;<i> stiction, can be easily optimised via internal pressure for  
</I>&gt;<i> differing load
</I>&gt;<i> carrying conditions, and can be mounted without the ends needing to  
</I>&gt;<i> stay
</I>&gt;<i> parallel through the full suspension movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This apparently simple suspension design is actually quite complex  
</I>&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;<i> way it works. Let's take a look.

  Balance of original trimmed to pass the size filter here.
