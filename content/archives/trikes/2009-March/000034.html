<PRE>Yes, the progression from double wishbones to semi-leading arms to a beam
axle has been an interesting learning experience. 

I am not backing away from that at all - at least I HAVE been able to learn!
Current system has best ride and handling, and easily lowest weight, of the
three different designs I have built.

Note: an equal gain in learning is the adoption of the Firestone airbags.

Hello Julian,

lower and lighter, very good to enhance performance of a trike!

I am impressed by your work. At the beginning you were very determined about
that a very advanced suspension was needed for good ride quality. So I was
surprised when you launched the semitrailing arm front end, and now a beam
axle! It gets worse and worse... get me right! =) I really like your
approach. And this is a kind of basic science that we need.

I grew up with beam axle rear ends on cars (european brand). Watt link was a
way to get it better, though I never built one myself. 

I may look closer to your design for a rear end of a delta trike that I plan
to build.
