Front Suspension Design

When looked down on from above, Chalky's front suspension is shaped like the
letter 'T'. The top of the 'T' is a solid axle that joins the two front
wheels, while the upright of the 'T' points towards the back of the machine.


Solid (beam) axles are widely regarded as being very low tech - suitable
only for agricultural machines like trucks. However, the use of a beam axle
in this application actually results in a very light-weight design. 

The upright of the 'T' is a torsion tube. It is pivoted at its base such
that the wheel axle can rise and fall, but twist (eg when the body rolls) is
resisted. That is, the torsion tube's pivot point is a horizontal axle, with
its axis at right-angles to the length of the car. 

To prevent the wheel axle moving laterally (ie by bending the torsion tube),
a Watts Link is placed at the mid-point of the beam axle. This prevents the
axle from moving sideways, while still allowing free vertical movement. 

Firestone model 4001 rolling-lip airbag springs are located a little inboard
of the 16 inch wheels. These air springs are light in weight, have no
stiction, can be easily optimised via internal pressure for differing load
carrying conditions, and can be mounted without the ends needing to stay
parallel through the full suspension movement.

This apparently simple suspension design is actually quite complex in the
way it works. Let's take a look.


.	Two-Wheel Bumps

Over two-wheel bumps (eg a speed hump), the front wheels rise and fall
together. That is, the wheel travel and the spring travel are the same (ie a
1:1 motion ratio). The spec'd travel of the air springs is 3.6 inches (but
in this front application I run them at about 3.8 inches), so over a
two-wheel bump, the maximum front suspension travel is 3.8 inches. 

Over this type of bump, the torsion tube acts just as a suspension member -
it doesn't twist. The Watts Link ensures the axle rises and falls without
any sideways movement.

Steering castor varies with wheel movement, with the castor increasing as
the suspension compresses.

.	One-Wheel Bump

Over a one-wheel bump (the vast majority of bumps - let's imagine a stone on
the road) a single wheel rises. 

Because the axle is supported at the opposite end by the other wheel, and
because the spring is mounted inboard from the rising wheel, and (finally)
because the torsion tube can twist (the inertial mass of the rider resists
being rotated, so the torsion tube twists instead), the compression of the
spring on a one-wheel bump is less than it would be for a two-wheel bump of
the same size. 

Therefore, compared with a two-wheel bump, the spring rate is effectively
lower, and the maximum travel is potentially higher - probably at least 6
inches.

In addition to the air spring, the torsion tube also resists the one-wheel
bump (remember, it acts as an anti-roll bar, and anti-roll bars resist
one-wheel bumps). One-wheel bumps attempt to cause some sideways movement of
the axle, but this is prevented by the Watts Link. When passing over a
one-wheel bump, the castor angles of the two front wheels no longer remain
the same. 

.	Cornering

When cornering, the body rolls. 

Resisting this is the air spring on the outer wheel and also the
longitudinal torsion tube. The spring has a slightly rising rate (it gets
stiffer as it is compressed more) but the torsion tube is linear in its
torsional behaviour. 

It's in cornering that the Watts Link is subject to its greatest forces,
with its action stopping the axle being pushed sideways. 

.	Dive

The suspension sees dive much like a two-wheel bump - the spring rate is
effectively higher than it is for one-wheel bumps. 


Other Characteristics

.	Steering Lock

Another characteristic of this suspension system is not in its behaviour but
in its shape - there is a lot of room for steering lock to occur.

.	Spring Motion Ratios

As implied above, the spring motion ratios are kept low. Compared with
motion ratios where the spring moves far less than the wheel, this approach
reduces bending stresses in the suspension arms. In the case of the air
springs, it also allows a lower inflation pressure to be used (giving better
headroom to the max allowable pressure, and so also permitting the machine
to cope with bigger load variations). 

.	Lightness

This suspension design uses about 25 per cent less tube than the Air 150's
semi-leading arm design.  The front suspension arm, complete with Watts Link
and rear bearings, weighs 1.7kg. With the two air springs, this rises by 700
grams for a total of 2.4kg.


Shortcomings

The leading, torsion tube, beam axle with Watts Link design also has some
shortcomings. 

Firstly, this suspension design doesn't have a dynamic negative camber
increase on bump - that is, the outer loaded wheel does not adopt negative
camber during cornering. 

But, in fact, it actually does! 

This is achieved not by the suspension but by the steering, that runs a lot
of castor and so automatically develops neg camber when steering lock is
applied. Furthermore, as the outer spring is compressed in cornering, so the
castor (and therefore neg camber) increases. 

It's impossible to have a beam axle and have track change with suspension
travel, so once a beam axle was decided upon, track-change damping as an
option went out the window. Damping on Chalky will either be via hydraulic
damper(s) - or no damping used at all. Initial testing indicates that
dampers may not be needed (in part because the natural frequency of the
suspension is so low, and so it is less easily excited by short-spaced
bumps.)

Having the steering wheels on the one axle also has the potential to give
bad steering shimmy, a problem that often occurred in cars of the 1920s and
1930s equipped with solid front axles. (It also can occur in unusual bicycle
designs.) However, shimmying always seems to be able to be overcome, either
by revising stiffness of bushes (etc), or by changing the steering stiffness
and/or geometry. I also wonder if shimmy of those old cars wasn't
exacerbated by the zero scrub radius, low castor angles and positive camber
then often adopted. 

The roll centre of the suspension is low. This was required for packaging
purposes, but it also means that the amount of body roll that occurs for a
given cornering force is higher than it would be if the roll centre was
further above the ground. 

Finally, the pitch centre is also low - which could cause dive problems when
braking (but at least dive is resisted by both springs) and allow rear
suspension extension, again when braking.

Fair enough.  I was also wondering about the joint at the bottom of the
front suspension arm, which appears to permit only vertical movement.

When in a single-wheel deflection, it would seem that there would need
to be some amount of torsional deflection of the suspension arm (on the
order of 10 degrees either direction at full bump if my math is right).

I also noted that this prototype does not have an anti-roll bar, though
from my observation above I would guess that it is fairly resistant to
roll as-is.

&gt;<i> Front suspension is unique: leading arm, torsion tube, beam axle with

I'm interpreting this to mean that both of these issues are addressed by
using the main tube of the 'T' as a torsion spring, can you elaborate
more on the front suspension design?
