<PRE>Amateurs with lots of money are a rare breed these days - it's nice to 
see one occasionally. And if they know anything about composite 
engineering so much the better. Their target market (style over 
substance) is actually the crowd who could most afford it. What an irony 
if that market lifted the bar on trike sales and prices...

I remember hearing a carbon fibre tube boom snap with a deafening crack 
at an HPV challenge back in the 90's - that would be a very expensive 
noise on this trike!

When/if I reach a 3rd-iteration prototype and have conceits of 
production-readiness, I'll give it to Moz to test, and inject a dose of 
reality.

Best,
G.
