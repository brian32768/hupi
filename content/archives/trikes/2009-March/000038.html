</I>
One problem is that somehow you have to allow for the extra weight of
the large wheels, and the extra weight of the trike required to cope
with the larger forces from those wheels. A trike with 700c wheels is
an interesting beast to build, and the lightest one I recall seeing
was over 20kg (it was unsuspended).

A long time ago Ian at Greenspeed published a letter or notes on their
experience shifting from a 26&quot; rear wheel to 20&quot;. From what I recall
he mostly focussed on the smaller wheel meaning shorter frame members,
and both those things meaning lighter tubing could be used, giving a
surprising reduction in weight as well as better wheel rigidity. My
experience with a 27&quot; wheel quad at high school was that it destroyed
wheels with enthusiasm even when ridden carefully (it had a Cortina
bench seat so it wasn't really a speed machine).

So the reduction in rolling resistance would have to be dramatic to
compensate for the disadvantages. With a bike many of these problems
are vastly reduced if not eliminated, so the question is very
different.
