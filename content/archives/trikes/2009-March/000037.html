</I>&gt;<i> One inflamed debate is that of wheel size. A large wheel is said to give less drag on rough surface because it does not go as deep in the bumps as a small wheel. I can imagine that a suspension on a small wheel can do the same thing as a large wheel without suspension - but I really don't know. Does suspension even out the differences between small and large wheels in this respect? What is your opinion or experience about this?

Alex Moulton seemed to think small wheels with suspension were the 
equivalent (or superior) of 700c without. I don't know how much (if any) 
quantitative data he had to back that up, though.
