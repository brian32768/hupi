One option might be the 4&quot; fat tyres used on chopper bikes that are
now available fairly cheaply. I have a pair for my quad and on sand
they work quite well - lower ground pressure so they float rather
than sinking into the sand. For snow/ice you'd probably want to put
studs through them.

You will need the special rims for those tyres, which means an extra
set of wheels. so perhaps also look at trials wheels and tyres
(they're often 388 rather than 405 rims) but there's a wider
selection of tyres available.
