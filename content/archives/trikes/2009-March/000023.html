Very lovely machine, but the cost puts it in the rarified air of those who can actually afford to buy (not rent occasionally) a Farrari, Bently, etc.

I noticed that the designer seems to have every indication of being an industrial designer, with furniture, trike, motorcycle/scooter, and sculture.  If he has an industrial design background then his trike design makes even more sense to me.

I wonder though why he goes to all the trouble of making a 100% carbon fiber highly engineered frame, add exotic, custom, semi custom, or just extremely &quot;high end&quot; components, make a custom adjustable seat, have two frame sizes, yet not make it as light as possible.  The machine appears to be a speed/performance machine, though he says it is what it is.  With the weight restriction (regardless of the 300% safety factor he says it has), I'd think it would be usable as a light touring machine.  

Personally I find it beautiful, very interesting as a design project, but otherwise a very impractical machine, price wise.  I hope he finds a way to reduce cost enough to get significant sales, though in the current US (and world) economy, maybe only the rich will be able to afford such a trike.

I ride an Organic Engine's Triclops, now a few years old (around 5 or 6), which was somewhat expensive only due to my having customizations on the basic factory model.  But it still rides great, is still fully adjustable, can haul stuff too, and is as much fun today as it was when I first got it.  I may get another trike at some point, but for now my old standby still does the trick.  But again, man, what a cool machine that carbon beauty is.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes but it is a beautiful work of art, besides looking very functional. I will never have the money for one but I certainly do admire it.
