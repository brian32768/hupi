Just a diversion from all the suspension action: it's apparent that 
people like a wide range of seat angles. Some trikes are really laid 
back and others are much more upright. Julian's looked very upright 
compared to my favoured position, but now he calls it too reclined!

What do people like, and can they say why? I always liked seats to be 
very laid back, but there's been talk of the best hill-climbing 
positions being more upright, from the 2-wheel world.

I've often dreamed of an on-the-fly-adjustable linkage to adjust the 
seat to suit both climbing and flat country...
