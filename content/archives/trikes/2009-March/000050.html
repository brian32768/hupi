<PRE>Whether you're lifting an enitre wheel and trike out of a &quot;hole&quot; or lifting 
an entire wheel and compressing suspension, it's still energy loss.  A 
larger diameter wheel with all else being equal would be more efficient 
because it drops less.

Hi again,

I see that you use small wheels.

One inflamed debate is that of wheel size. A large wheel is said to give 
less drag on rough surface because it does not go as deep in the bumps as a 
small wheel. I can imagine that a suspension on a small wheel can do the 
same thing as a large wheel without suspension - but I really don't know. 
Does suspension even out the differences between small and large wheels in 
this respect? What is your opinion or experience about this?
