<PRE>I have no opinion on rolling resistance per se - I have never done any
measurements of it and, to be honest, I don't really care much anyway. 

However, I am very interested in ride comfort from different sized wheels.
The 20 inch Greenspeeds clearly ride better than the 16 inch Greenspeeds.
When I found that out I resolved to use only 20 inch wheels on my designs.
But the Air 150 rode so incredibly well (especially when loaded for touring)
that I realised I could trade off a lot of ride comfort and still be happy.

Therefore for packaging reasons (ie the size of the disassembled package) I
went this time to 16 inch wheels, and kevlar banded tyres. I expected a
harsher ride but at this stage in my testing, ride comfort is actually
better (lower suspension pivot height on front helps), but there's a little
more high frequency vibration on coarse surfaces. 

I do not agree with the idea that wheels should be limited in droop so that
they don't 'catch' in holes - I again run about 40-50 per cent static
deflection (ie about half the travel used up when the trike is loaded - this
can easily be adjusted with the airbag springs). 

With decent suspension, I think that even 14 inch wheels would be fine.

Hi again,

I see that you use small wheels.

One inflamed debate is that of wheel size. A large wheel is said to give
less drag on rough surface because it does not go as deep in the bumps as a
small wheel. I can imagine that a suspension on a small wheel can do the
same thing as a large wheel without suspension - but I really don't know.
Does suspension even out the differences between small and large wheels in
this respect? What is your opinion or experience about this?

/Bruno
