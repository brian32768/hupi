It's a joke, right?

It looks just like any other amateur first attempt at a recumbent
trike, albeit one with some design flair and made of carbon fibre.
That actually seems to be the target market - people who want it to
look nice, rather than those who want to go fast or carry anything.
It's not particularly elegant, light or streamlined, and it doesn't
appear to have any way to carry more than a wallet and cellphone.

That said, I'd love to test one... mostly because if some 102kg guy
has had a real go at it I'd like to know if I can meet the challenge.
Looking at it I suspect that heavy stop-start riding would see the
end of it within a Mm or two. But it would be fun to find out.
