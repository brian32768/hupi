Fair enough.  I was also wondering about the joint at the bottom of the
front suspension arm, which appears to permit only vertical movement.

When in a single-wheel deflection, it would seem that there would need
to be some amount of torsional deflection of the suspension arm (on the
order of 10 degrees either direction at full bump if my math is right).

I also noted that this prototype does not have an anti-roll bar, though
from my observation above I would guess that it is fairly resistant to
roll as-is.

I'm interpreting this to mean that both of these issues are addressed by
using the main tube of the 'T' as a torsion spring, can you elaborate
more on the front suspension design?
