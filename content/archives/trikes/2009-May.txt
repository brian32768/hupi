I live in Ormond Beach, Fla. just next to Daytona, the Motorcycle capital of the world, or so they say.  About a month ago during "Bike Week" I noticed a lot more trikes.  But what interested me was so many now are add-ons.  They actually have 3 wheels in the back.

 

I have 3 recumbents, a Kettwiesel, a Gold Rush and a Vision Metro.  For some time I have wanted to convert my Vision to a Trike.  However the conversion kits I found available did not provide for proper gearing.  

 

Getting older I am having more problems clicking in and then getting started again at stops.  So I though why not training wheels.  Seeing the 3 wheeled motorcycles gave me the idea to try it.

 

First I found a 2 child bike trailer for sale.  I took it and removed everything but the lower frame and wheels. I then narrowed it by three inches. Then attached it to my Metro after much thought and the help of a friend.  It took several modifications of our ideas but today after changing some shims ----- IT WORKS!!!!

 

I only road it around the block today so it has not been road tested.  It rides great going straight.  Going around corners it feels like it is going over so no fast turning.  So for $45 for the used trailer and $12 for some aluminum I have another trike .. I think.  

 

I now have to put some miles on it around the neighbor to get a final opinion or to make any modifications.  Anyway it has been fun.  I would be glad to send a picture to anyone wanting one.  I am also open to any ideas on other ways to accomplish the same thing or ideas on how to improve what I have built.

Today I road about 3 miles around the neighborhood.  It rides fine except when you want to turn.  It then becomes rather unstable and of course wants to lift the outside wheel.  So as of now it is good as long as I go straight or very slowly around corners

When I made it I narrowed the frame by 4 inches, from 32 to 28 inches.  That may be part of the problem.  I will expand it back to 32 inches.  However, I am wondering if since it has a middle drive wheel if the bike thinks the rear wheelbase is only 14 inches.  Anyone have any ideas?  Also the outboard wheels are 2 1/2 inches behind the drive wheel.  Could this contribute to the problem?

Any ideas freely  accepted. 

Thanks,

Ed Logan

Hello Ed

The problem with your setup is how tall your bike is. Note how much  
lower your Kettwiesel is. That is how trikes keep from being tippy.

Ideally, you should rig it up so that the "training wheels" can be  
raised once you get under way and lowered when you plan to stop.

The alternatives are to make the wheelbase of the training wheels  
awkwardly wide or to ride very slowly while turning. It is
a simple matter of physical realities.

The offset of the outboard wheels should not be significant.

Happy experimenting!

Allan

A trike is only stable while (simplistic view) the Centre of Gravity 
(CofG) is acting within the triangle formed by the 3 wheels - when you 
go in a straight line, the CofG acts downwards (and a bit backward when 
you accelerate/a bit forward when you brake (under heavy breaking, it 
is possible to ground the chainwheel on some trikes)).  When you 
corner, the CofG acts to the outside - and the faster you are going and 
the sharper you are turning, the more to the outside, until the inside 
wheel lifts and, if you do not straighten, the trike flips.

So, you need the seat as low as possible, and (on a delta trike) the 
rear wheels not too far back and as wide apart as possible - the 
Kettweisel (the only delta trike I am familiar with) has the rear 
wheels just behind the seat and is remarkably stable - at a cycle 
centre for disabled people I help at, there are 4 Kettwiesels, and is 6 
years there has only been one accident on a Kettweisel (as far as I 
know) when a carer completely lost the plot when it came to steering 
and instead of following the track round a bend, went straight on and 
ended up in a stream - even here the Kettweisel stayed upright (though 
the carer was VERY wet!). There are a wide variety of clients including 
school kids who sometimes ride the Kettweisels with great enthusiasm, 
and the only problem is the need to replace the rear tyres regularly as 
a result of over enthusiastic braking.

Without seeing a picture of your machine, and knowing it is
a coversion from a SWB, I'd suggest the most likely causes
of it tipping too easily are :-

1. CG too high.
2. Track too narrow.
3. CG too far farward.

You may need to learn to be a acrobat, like the riders of racing
upright trikes and really lean into the corners!

Oner fairly easy fix may be to use smaller wheels!

Hi Ed


When you mentioned that turning the bike the outside wheel is lifted, it reminded me of the Chameleon trike that is on the Stites Design website http://www.stitesdesign.com/wrap_hpv.html The back wheels remain fixed on the ground and the seat pivots.

I'm not sure if this would help with your design but it is another element to think of.

Hi Ed,

Your steering geometry, may not be suitable for a vehicle that doesn't lean over.  It seems to me that delta trikes have a shallow steering neck angle and considerable fork rake.

I want to thank everyone who responded to my request for ideas.  I was so interested in how motorcycles had converted to trikes by adding outboard wheels that I really didn't stop to analyze if it would work on a recumbent bike.  I just went to work.  However, I learned a lot and had a lot of fun.  So now I will convert the frame and wheels into a trailer.

I built a wooden low racer a couple of years back that was a blast to ride and fun to build.  Maybe I can use the plans from Atomic Zombie's DeltaRunner Recumbent trike and build it out of wood.  http://www.atomiczombie.com/product-deltarunner.htm

Again, thanks to all.

GRR, Kettwiesel, Vision Metro and now a new trailer.

Me too Fran (and all):

I'm pretty good at text parsing -- if for technical reasons the archives 
can't be made available through the current ihpva or other hosting servers, 
I would be happy to try my hand at making them available some other 
searchable way.  It's possible I could rethread and reload them as email, or 
at least make them into web pages on the site.  If desired, I could mask the 
original email addresses, to avoid spam, etc.

Cheers,

Kevin Atkins
