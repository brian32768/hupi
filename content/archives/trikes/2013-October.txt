So...

I know about the Greenspeed X4 Rail HPV for garden railways, but has
anyone adapted a tadpole trike to a standard 4'8&1/2" railway?

Isn?t there a section of the IHPVA World Championships for rail vehicles? 
I?m sure I saw footage at one point - and I?m sure they were ?standard? gauge (?real trains?).
Was it at one of the Swiss events? 
Cheers,

     I have one of the original review Wiz Wheelz-Terra Trike 3.6 tadpole trikes.  I wanted to hang it to free up floor space. Rather than hang from the rear wheel with all the weight of the built up trike on the rear rim, I put up two hangers and hung the trike by the front wheels.  With a Zipper "Chopper" fairing on their three point mount and all the accessories on the trike and rear rack, it puts a lot less stress on the rims to hang from two rims rather than one.  Fortunately the tires on my trike are right at 32 inches center to center and with the wall studs 16 inches on center (16 inches center to center) I was able to anchor the Terra Trike wall mounts into studs on both sides.  With an eight foot wall in the garage, the six foot long trike with accessories hangs just fine.  I roll the trike back to the wall with front facing away.  Lift to vertical, turn to face the wall, place wheels close to the wall, slide to the left and lower to hang.   To remove I lift slightly, slide to the right, turn half way around and set the trike down facing away from the wall.  No need to remove anything and ready to ride at any time.

Wow, very nice elegant solution and very clear description of the
solution and procedure.  It even addresses the challenge of dealing with
a front fairing without scratching it.  Thank you!

I wouldn't be concerned for the rear rim as you are.  It is just not that
much weight.  Consider a Rhino Lite rim in a touring two wheeler.  A 240lb
rider and 60 lb of gear (as a Clydesdale this sounds reasonable) evenly
distributed is 150lb.  There is nothing inherently different about hanging
rather than resting on the wheel, except the touring bike has dynamic
loading that goes higher.

A 20 inch wheel is waaaay stronger.  My Greenspeed GTO weighs about 50lb
when I am not riding it.

I say just pad the thing you hang it from and be done.

I used to use a row of standard folding wall-mounted bike racks in my garage. These folded when not in use, when down they had a padded ?U? projecting into the garage space at maybe a 20? spacing. The crossmember of the trike sat on the arms nose towards the ceiling with all three wheels resting against the wall.

I haven't tried to hang my spouses trike, but I wouldn't worry about hanging it by one wheel.? The stress on a rim, while hanging staticly, is nothing compared to the dynamic forces, while riding.? You might even find that hanging it by one front wheel works and saves you from trying to engage two wheels in hooks, at once.

I like this idea ! Thanks.  It seems like it would avoid banging the front gear ring on the ground and also be easier in general.   I'm going to give it a try.

Never one to take the "easy" way out, I went to my local Chinese Tool Store (aka Harbor Freight Tools) and bought one of their 440# capacity electric lifts.  At the time I had a Leitra and I built a flat platform out of plywood with chains and eyescrews attached so I could roll the trike onto the platform, attach 4 rings to the hook, and proceed to elevate the trike overhead.  I forst did this in the Automotive Shop of the high school where I taught.  Later I did this in my garage at home where I was able to raise the trike above my wife's minivan in between roof trusses 24" on center.

After selling the Leitra, I kept the lift (not the platform) and have stored my unfaired Taiwanese trike overhead using bungee-like cords with hooks attached to all 3 wheels.

We have since moved and I have taken the lift with me but have yet to install it -- too many other demands with the new house.

Subject: [trikes] Fighting rust inside steel tubes
In-Reply-To: <mailman.1.1382630402.2702.trikes@hupi.org>
References: <mailman.1.1382630402.2702.trikes@hupi.org>

I once hung my Greenspeed tadpole by its rear wheel . . . and was 
chagrined to find a slow leak of brownish water come dripping out of the 
main tube. Clearly the result of riding in a few too many rainstorms.

So a head's-up (though I should have expected it already): It may not be 
a bad idea to periodically take the trike apart, dry it out fully, and 
coat the tubes with a rust preventative. Your LBS wrench should have 
some ideas of how to apply the stuff.

You might even find that hanging it by one front wheel works and saves you from trying to engage two wheels in hooks, at once.
