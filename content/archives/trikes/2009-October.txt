25hz,

I would love to see the links to the quad dominant articles.  My flat fee
never hurt, but my knees were deteriorating as a consequence.  Inserts are
nearly a cure for me.  I wear them cycling and for every day use.

I don't know if quad dominant is the chicken or the egg, but it is in the
mix.  Exercises helped me also. An odd illio-tibial band stretch seems
important.  IT band should not be banjo string tight as mine became.
