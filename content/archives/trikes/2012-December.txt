Has anyone had any experience with heated gloves? The older I get, the 
colder my fingers get whenever it's below freezing. And since I ride 
throughout the winter, I spend a lot of time with frigid digits.

Any help will be appreciated.

I use Gerbing gloves, both for my motorcycle (12V) and my trike (7V). Not cheap but worth every penny. I hate cold hands (and so does The Madam).
