<PRE>No replies this time, that is odd.

I have a couple hundred miles on the ELF now.   I can do my commute and it
isn't bad at all.  I can average about 21.5mph for the 24 mile trip.  This
is with my husbanding resources, both mine and the batteries.  I get 14
miles from one allegedly 9Ah battery.  I believe with more fitness I will
be able to average 23mph. Part of it will be learning how to use the
batteries best.  I have some power to spare, but I am making sure I don't
run out.  It is much too heavy for unassisted pedaling on inclines.

I really do want some shorter cranks, I just can't spin 175mm ones as well
as I like.

I like it, I can get where I need to go quickly enough, it takes off at
lights and crest hills so much better than I can do on a non-assisted
xxcycle.  The exercise is at a really good level.  I can maintain a good
level of work and I don't blow up on hills.  I am more liable to over
extend on slight downhills where I turn the transmission all the way up and
work as hard as I can for the cadence.  But, I can rest and use the motor,
then work some more.

I am pretty happy with it.  It does what they say. If you are hearty you
can do more.

There are some fragility issues with bodywork, but any HPV has to work at
the edge of durability to keep weight down.

I have ridden at night, and the wind screen was to reflective of the
interior and ground and I have a hard time seeing the road.  But I made a
dash board that does the trick.  I have already started depending on it for
towels, a hat, a flashlight, and a water bottle.

&gt;<i> HI all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I finally have my ELF and some time to mess with it.  I thought y'all
</I>&gt;<i> might like to hear a little about it.  I can't be to revealing because I
</I>&gt;<i> signed an NDA and got a deal to do beta testing (log comments essentially).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I said some things that were probably based on old information from a
</I>&gt;<i> website that needed cleaning up, and from comments by people who probably
</I>&gt;<i> should have been more circumspect or silent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> here's  what I said at first:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I think I can really make good use of one.  My commute is 23.5 miles each
</I>&gt;<i> way.  More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if that
</I>&gt;<i> is at full, electric only, speed.  But, it should be fine with a legs and
</I>&gt;<i> battery power.   It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall current
</I>&gt;<i> in two hours.  So I can easily get to work and back.  It will go a lot
</I>&gt;<i> faster than 20mph with leg power.  I might maintain 25mph or more for the
</I>&gt;<i> trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter trike.
</I>&gt;<i>  It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.  I don't know if it is geared
</I>&gt;<i> for higher.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still think I will be able to make the commute, but I will have to
</I>&gt;<i> regain some fitness.  Yesterday I went shopping and to a brewery for a
</I>&gt;<i> beer.  The first leg I averaged 21.7mph, hit 34.4mph on one hill, then I
</I>&gt;<i> moseyed around for a little while socializing, bought a gallon of juice,
</I>&gt;<i> and 4 lb of popcorn, and headed home.  Final average speed was 19mph.  14
</I>&gt;<i> miles total.  Seemed like I worked pretty hard.  The trike weighs 120lb and
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently just under 260. I had an extra battery I did not use
</I>&gt;<i> (13.4lb), and jug of water.  I have made some other shorter ride, one at
</I>&gt;<i> night.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The comment about 30 miles without pedaling, is not something I can get.
</I>&gt;<i>  Maybe a small person in flat country, a best case scenario.  I see claims
</I>&gt;<i> like that are completely absent t from  the website now.  I can't see
</I>&gt;<i> anything they are saying that I would disagree with now.  I think it is all
</I>&gt;<i> the claim it is.  But less than I was claiming.  I heard I would recharge
</I>&gt;<i> in 2 hours, but the charger they gave me took twice that.  I am not sure of
</I>&gt;<i> the state of charge after my ride.  I believe it is a 10Ah battery LiFePO4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is stoutly made and not light. So far I think it seems like a very good
</I>&gt;<i> first attempt.  It rides quite nicely and felt very confident at 30+mph.
</I>&gt;<i> Some times it cuts off hard (going down as fast as possible), one time I
</I>&gt;<i> was cruising at 25mph and still getting some help, I think because the
</I>&gt;<i> acceleration was low?  It won't give much help unless I gear it differently
</I>&gt;<i> or hack something.  I have had to revise my hopes for a 30mph commute down
</I>&gt;<i> a lot., BUt maybe I can average 22 fairly soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Earlier Bob Stuart made some comments back channel and I thought you all
</I>&gt;<i> might be interested in them and how I find the ELF in that regard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BS:
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you think it will go faster with leg power?  The booster cuts out,
</I>&gt;<i> leaving you on your own over 20 MPH, and probably unable to maintain 21.
</I>&gt;<i>  You'd need a major downhill to see 40.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MR:Right on the money.  But I think I can keep it up above 21.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BS:
</I>&gt;<i> I see seven videos to choose from, and no contrary claims for speed.  If
</I>&gt;<i> it is fast, they'd brag, not hint.  These things are usually very hackable.
</I>&gt;<i>  The 20 MPH limit is sometimes imposed by a jumper wire that can be moved
</I>&gt;<i> according to market.  As long as you are visibly pedaling, the police
</I>&gt;<i> usually have something else to worry about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MR: I think it can be done with  a PC.  (Kelly Controls)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  My guess would be that without a booster, you would not be able to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain the speed you get from a plain bicycle.  Given how easy
</I>&gt;<i> streamlining is, I'd expect to get at least a third more speed from any
</I>&gt;<i> rainproof enclosure, so to me, adding power is like throwing hardware at a
</I>&gt;<i> software problem.  Legally, it is the only way to cruise over 20.  However,
</I>&gt;<i> the first thing I'd want to change is the motor control.  A separate switch
</I>&gt;<i> makes a pedelec feel like a woefully underpowered regular vehicle.  A
</I>&gt;<i> pedal-force multiplier, OTOH, can use the same power that makes you a
</I>&gt;<i> frustrated motorist and make you feel like a superman on pedals.  At these
</I>&gt;<i> power levels, that gets more important, as your own contribution otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> feels insignificant, and you don't even get your exercise motivation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MR:I am doing OK with the thumb accelerator, but the idea of a pedal
</I>&gt;<i> switch is interesting.  I would need an override for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't want to feel as if you are riding an exercycle on display in an
</I>&gt;<i> awkward little cart, disrupting traffic.  All the green points available to
</I>&gt;<i> man don't make that look cool.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MR: Well, it is an exercycle to me...but I am not cool.  This isn't an
</I>&gt;<i> awkward cart though, it is a pretty good trike.  I have a good route, low
</I>&gt;<i> density, 45mph limit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BS: At these price levels, you also want to check on durability and
</I>&gt;<i> serviceability,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MR: So far I am pretty happy with it.  It is well built.  Maybe some trim
</I>&gt;<i> component issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BS: and ask yourself if you will be able to put up with the drum-like road
</I>&gt;<i> noise amplification over the long haul.  Try to get a decibel reading, and
</I>&gt;<i> ponder the enormous health and productivity gains realized by efforts to
</I>&gt;<i> quiet down offices.  Would you be safe with noise-canceling headphones on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MR: It isn't noisy enough that I can remember except on rough pavement.
</I>&gt;<i>  IT is doorless and that seems like a goo compromise.  The breeze is OK for
</I>&gt;<i> moderate temps that I have seen, side winds aren't an issue so far, and it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't sound like being in a barrel or anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BS:
</I>&gt;<i> Your numbers don't add up.  The power required at 30 mph is double to
</I>&gt;<i> triple what you need at 20.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MS: I am in total agreement, now.  Maybe with some hot rodding and shorter
</I>&gt;<i> cranks... The ride is half down hill, half uphill, so maybe I can make up
</I>&gt;<i> some time on the downsides.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bob also brought up lighting controls, ELF has an OK handle bar switch for
</I>&gt;<i> headlamps, turns,LEDs, and a horn relay so these switches see little power.
</I>&gt;<i>  May be OK wait and see.  Brake lights from a disc brake mounted switch
</I>&gt;<i> (have not looked close at that)  I think I want a dash to reduce reflection
</I>&gt;<i> from below.  Some black fabric can do that. And, I just like more forward
</I>&gt;<i> light so will do more there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's all for now.  I just wanted to correct some things I said that were
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect or dated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for all past and future comments.
