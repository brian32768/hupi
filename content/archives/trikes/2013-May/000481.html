</I>&gt;<i> level of work and I don't blow up on hills.  I am more liable to over
</I>&gt;<i> extend on slight downhills where I turn the transmission all the way up and
</I>&gt;<i> work as hard as I can for the cadence.  But, I can rest and use the motor,
</I>&gt;<i> then work some more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am pretty happy with it.  It does what they say. If you are hearty you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HI all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I finally have my ELF and some time to mess with it.  I thought y'all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might like to hear a little about it.  I can't be to revealing because I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signed an NDA and got a deal to do beta testing (log comments
</I>&gt;<i> essentially).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I said some things that were probably based on old information from a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; website that needed cleaning up, and from comments by people who probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should have been more circumspect or silent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here's  what I said at first:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I think I can really make good use of one.  My commute is 23.5 miles
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way.  More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is at full, electric only, speed.  But, it should be fine with a legs and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; battery power.   It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall
</I>&gt;<i> current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in two hours.  So I can easily get to work and back.  It will go a lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; faster than 20mph with leg power.  I might maintain 25mph or more for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter
</I>&gt;<i> trike.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.  I don't know if it is geared
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for higher.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still think I will be able to make the commute, but I will have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regain some fitness.  Yesterday I went shopping and to a brewery for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beer.  The first leg I averaged 21.7mph, hit 34.4mph on one hill, then I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moseyed around for a little while socializing, bought a gallon of juice,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and 4 lb of popcorn, and headed home.  Final average speed was 19mph.  14
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; miles total.  Seemed like I worked pretty hard.  The trike weighs 120lb
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am currently just under 260. I had an extra battery I did not use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (13.4lb), and jug of water.  I have made some other shorter ride, one at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; night.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The comment about 30 miles without pedaling, is not something I can get.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Maybe a small person in flat country, a best case scenario.  I see
</I>&gt;<i> claims
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like that are completely absent t from  the website now.  I can't see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything they are saying that I would disagree with now.  I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the claim it is.  But less than I was claiming.  I heard I would recharge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in 2 hours, but the charger they gave me took twice that.  I am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the state of charge after my ride.  I believe it is a 10Ah battery
</I>&gt;<i> LiFePO4.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is stoutly made and not light. So far I think it seems like a very
</I>&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first attempt.  It rides quite nicely and felt very confident at 30+mph.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some times it cuts off hard (going down as fast as possible), one time I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was cruising at 25mph and still getting some help, I think because the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acceleration was low?  It won't give much help unless I gear it
</I>&gt;<i> differently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or hack something.  I have had to revise my hopes for a 30mph commute
</I>&gt;<i> down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot., BUt maybe I can average 22 fairly soon.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Earlier Bob Stuart made some comments back channel and I thought you all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might be interested in them and how I find the ELF in that regard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why do you think it will go faster with leg power?  The booster cuts out,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leaving you on your own over 20 MPH, and probably unable to maintain 21.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  You'd need a major downhill to see 40.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MR:Right on the money.  But I think I can keep it up above 21.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see seven videos to choose from, and no contrary claims for speed.  If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is fast, they'd brag, not hint.  These things are usually very
</I>&gt;<i> hackable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  The 20 MPH limit is sometimes imposed by a jumper wire that can be moved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; according to market.  As long as you are visibly pedaling, the police
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usually have something else to worry about.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MR: I think it can be done with  a PC.  (Kelly Controls)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  My guess would be that without a booster, you would not be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintain the speed you get from a plain bicycle.  Given how easy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; streamlining is, I'd expect to get at least a third more speed from any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rainproof enclosure, so to me, adding power is like throwing hardware at
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; software problem.  Legally, it is the only way to cruise over 20.
</I>&gt;<i>  However,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the first thing I'd want to change is the motor control.  A separate
</I>&gt;<i> switch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes a pedelec feel like a woefully underpowered regular vehicle.  A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pedal-force multiplier, OTOH, can use the same power that makes you a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frustrated motorist and make you feel like a superman on pedals.  At
</I>&gt;<i> these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; power levels, that gets more important, as your own contribution
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feels insignificant, and you don't even get your exercise motivation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MR:I am doing OK with the thumb accelerator, but the idea of a pedal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; switch is interesting.  I would need an override for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You don't want to feel as if you are riding an exercycle on display in an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; awkward little cart, disrupting traffic.  All the green points available
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; man don't make that look cool.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MR: Well, it is an exercycle to me...but I am not cool.  This isn't an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; awkward cart though, it is a pretty good trike.  I have a good route, low
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; density, 45mph limit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BS: At these price levels, you also want to check on durability and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; serviceability,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MR: So far I am pretty happy with it.  It is well built.  Maybe some trim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; component issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BS: and ask yourself if you will be able to put up with the drum-like
</I>&gt;<i> road
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; noise amplification over the long haul.  Try to get a decibel reading,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ponder the enormous health and productivity gains realized by efforts to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quiet down offices.  Would you be safe with noise-canceling headphones
</I>&gt;<i> on?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MR: It isn't noisy enough that I can remember except on rough pavement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  IT is doorless and that seems like a goo compromise.  The breeze is OK
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moderate temps that I have seen, side winds aren't an issue so far, and
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't sound like being in a barrel or anything.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your numbers don't add up.  The power required at 30 mph is double to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; triple what you need at 20.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MS: I am in total agreement, now.  Maybe with some hot rodding and
</I>&gt;<i> shorter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cranks... The ride is half down hill, half uphill, so maybe I can make up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some time on the downsides.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bob also brought up lighting controls, ELF has an OK handle bar switch
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; headlamps, turns,LEDs, and a horn relay so these switches see little
</I>&gt;<i> power.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  May be OK wait and see.  Brake lights from a disc brake mounted switch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (have not looked close at that)  I think I want a dash to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> reflection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from below.  Some black fabric can do that. And, I just like more forward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; light so will do more there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's all for now.  I just wanted to correct some things I said that
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incorrect or dated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for all past and future comments.
