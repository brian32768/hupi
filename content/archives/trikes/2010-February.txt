Tom,
I just saw it! I think you should have that "passenger" seat tied to your bohinie and allow all of us legitimate trike riders to take turns kicking it as you walk a gauntlet line.

Tom,

I'm an "older" rider and would much prefer a recliner.  To aid in egress from the trike a spring loaded extraction mechanism would also be something to consider.  I applaud your eco- and economy minded solution to the plethora of much more costly passenger trikes as well!

just noticed on that other trike/bent site, as i am excluded from posting; like i really care, someone whining that no one waves or speaks to him while riding or at a stop light while sitting on a diamond frame.  most of us have ridden long enough that we no longer desire to be noticed.  for crying out loud i'm out for a training ride and gasping for air is a full time occupation.  

and as for rodies waiving to me 90% of the time they initiate it.  for those who crave the wave get over it. nobody loves ya baby!!
