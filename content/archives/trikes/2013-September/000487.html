<PRE>After many years of avocation (work more than I care to count) I have a
version of a reasonable Tilting trike system or TTW. It works mainly as a
tadpole but would work as a delta also. 

 

My concept is a machine where you are a non tilting trike at low speed and
you are a virtual bicycle at high speed. In short you take off from a trike
transform to a enhanced bike and land back into a trike as a cycle.

 

This does not mean much unless you ride it. Video may help a little. I rode
Ice and Veloteknik suspended trikes at  the Midwest recumbent rally and see
and feel the type has advanced quite a bit. I think my TTW would compete
price wise if commercialized IMHO. The solution is a much simplified version
of the APAX. I will post a link to it if there is enough interest here.

 

Anyway I am canvassing to see if there is any imagination interest in this
concept at this time. It could work in velomobile and a natural for e- 

Bikes all challenging fields in themselves. The old saw of the TTW is to
combine the best of bike and trike dynamics for a net marketable gain. 

 

Best regards,
