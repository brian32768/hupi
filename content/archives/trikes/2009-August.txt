Thanks, Giles, for the description. Riding just like a two-wheeler is not very interesting to me, in that case I can ride a two-wheeler and save weight. However a system that can be locked is interesting. I have ridden a two-wheeler and notice that stop and start takes a lot of time because of balancing and clicking in and out of the SPD, while on the trike, I just go and can put all the effort in braking and accelerating. 

I believe that a slightly rising linkage combined with a disc brake for extra locking can be very interesting and add advantage over other designs. The system you describe that is rising near the center and then falls is very interesting. Are there any descriptions on how to build this or other rising linkages?

I have got a "conventional" velomobile. There are only a handful of these in my country (Sweden). I need something less conventional - the tadpole has got too much weight on the front wheels in combination with too little on the driving wheel, so it is hard to push through soft material. A delta is better in that respect, I believe, and a FWD leaning delta may work better too.

Each trike was built by people who extrapolated the dimensions themselves. 
Any other additions to them will be done the same way.  None of this is 
cookie cutter, it's all custom, but simple to do.  I didn't make a rack, I 
made a tailbox.

Here's an example of tilting with a "rising" linkage.

My main concern is an every day vehicle that is practical but at the same time not too slow or heavy and that is not too heavy to pedal on soft ground. It is really hard to beat an ordinary upright bike in that respect.

I've seen them with just a parallelogram linkage, which makes them handle just like a bike when unlocked. The advantage over a bike is that you can lock it when riding slowly - some have a brake disc that lets you lock it in any position for cambered roads etc.

But you can also make a "rising" linkage, which means the trike falls towards the centre and tends to stay upright. Too much rise is bad though because you have to force it into a corner by leaning strongly and/or countersteering. I have a teacher friend here in Qld who has had his school build a rising leaning delta for Pedal Prix, and he has reported it handles very nicely (I've not ridden it yet). It rises for the first few degrees of lean from the vertical, and then falls in the normal parallelogram fashion. It's a glass monocoque, and faired quite tightly so there's no real ability to lean it by moving your body weight.

So many interesting things to build, so little time (I've invested a lot of time in a conventional tad with fairing now - funny to describe it as conventional :-)

Depending on the design, there's sometimes room for cargo between the back wheels.

The one I've seen has the usual parallelogram linking the two rear 
wheels. Instead of the frame just pivoting at the centre of one of the 
horizontal members, it has a cam that rolls along it. The shape of this 
cam determines how the weight rises. I can't find a decent drawing of 
the setup, unfortunately.

Some really good info at http://www.jetrike.com/prior-art.html on 
different designs that have been tried. I like the one that can be 
ridden down stairs and still stay upright :-)

Message-ID: <6fa3617a0908200924l51e001aan203af33f93ad4857@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

It may be my first post here but a quick scan of the archives shows friends,
acquainted a long time ago and more recently.

The tilting delta I showed at the MHPSC is my second and the first I've
built based on the original Magic leaning trike.  I've owned the Magic since
about '99 when I "inherited" it from the designer, my mentor.  It is a
simple design and when the rear toe-in is adjusted properly it is capable of
very tight turns.  Some may remember it in the parking lot at the Ford
Proving Grounds turning 12 ft circles around small groups of people at near
45 deg lean over.  Note that the 1-hour race results are nbt wholly
indicative since I had just arrived that afternoon and did not get a chance
to fine tune the rear wheel alignment before the mass start.  By Sunday, I
had the alignment and thus the handling mostly in hand.

For those who haven't already seen it, here is a video of the original in
action.  I'll try to get video of the new trike up soon.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdSLRD_2vzc

As you can see, the new trike is considerably lower.  So low that I was able
to change the rear track from 20" on the down to just over a foot.

The advantage of a tilting delta over a bike is during cornering.  I know it
sounds counter-intuitive, but the extra contact patch at the rear allows the
machine to hang in there when a two-wheeler will begin to over-steer.  The
disadvantage compared to a tadpole is that it is still possible to lose the
single front contact patch.  I suppose the ideal cornering vehicle would be
a leaning quad.... but I haven't yet worked out the details for such a
machine.

I didn't see a final weight on the site, but the first post with the
trike on 3 wheels indicated he was at 15kg and hoping for ~20kg total.
