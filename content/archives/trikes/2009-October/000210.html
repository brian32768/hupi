<PRE>25hz,

I would love to see the links to the quad dominant articles.  My flat fee
never hurt, but my knees were deteriorating as a consequence.  Inserts are
nearly a cure for me.  I wear them cycling and for every day use.

I don't know if quad dominant is the chicken or the egg, but it is in the
mix.  Exercises helped me also. An odd illio-tibial band stretch seems
important.  IT band should not be banjo string tight as mine became.

</I>&gt;<i> cadence is just how we measure it.  If your foot speed on the short cranks
</I>&gt;<i> is as slow as on the long ones, your knees will hurt more because your lever
</I>&gt;<i> arm is shorter.  Short cranks MIGHT help your knees, even with too low of a
</I>&gt;<i> cadence because they bend your knee less.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bottom line, is you need to spin at 80 to 100 for long cranks, and
</I>&gt;<i> obviously the cadence will be higher with shorter ones.  Especially if you

</I>&gt;<i> don't spin enough.  So keep spinning.  My knees are busted up too, and aside
</I>&gt;<i> from all the benefit spinning, short cranks and oval rings have provided, I
</I>&gt;<i> recently stumbled across a few pages talking about the evils of being &quot;quad
</I>&gt;<i> dominant&quot;.  I present all the symptoms of slightly knock kneed, knees
</I>&gt;<i> together when I stand up from sitting, popping knees, rolled ankles, flat
</I>&gt;<i> feet, etc.  I've been doing some simple exercises (about 4 minutes a day at
</I>&gt;<i> lunch) to cure it and the improvements are fast and obvious.  I'll see if I
</I>&gt;<i> can track down the site again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  i'm calling in the pros.  this has probably been discussed more than the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> price of milk and butter but now it has bitten  me in the butt.  i've read
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the press that shorter cranks make spinning easier.  that being said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that for the first time i am having knee issues while wearing knee braces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and am wondering if these shorties are causing the knee pain when i want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crank like i do on longer ones. the knee braces work well on my stratus and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other trikes that i have owned.  i'm finding that if i don't spin i'm in for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a long day. i also find that if i do spin and do it all day prolonged spin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results in the muscle on the inside of my thigh fatiguing rapidly.
