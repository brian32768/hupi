Fran, my thoughts and condolences to you. What an especially sad thing  
for a parent to have to go through.
 From reading your stories here, I feel that you're a truly strong  
person and that somehow you'll get through it. Maybe riding can be the  
light at the end of the tunnel.

Best wishes.

Nelson

Subject: [trikes] testing suspension trike on rough trail
Message-ID: <001701ca7bcc$1684fec0$438efc40$@edgar@bigpond.com>

Hi Folks,
 
After about a 9 months' hiatus I am again back on my self-built suspension
trike. (Hiatus due to moving interstate, changing jobs, etc.)
 
Details on my trike at www.autospeed.com - search under 'Chalky' - there's a
7 part series that covers its full development. Since that series I have
added front dampers to go with the Firestone airbags (I've always used a
rear damper). 
 
Today I went on a very rough dirt trail that follows the railway line out of
Bungendore (New South Wales, Australia). You can see a pic of the trike on
the trail at
http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/Chalkyontrail.jpg
(with other photos of the trike development at
http://s638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/ )
 
The photo doesn't really do the trail justice - estimated 15 per cent
ascents, washaways (where creeks have crossed the trail and removed much
dirt, leaving behind rocks), steep descents, one very quick black snake,
some beautiful birds, lots of large rocks as big as a man's fist (fallen
from the railway's ballast), etc.
 
I rode with about 10-12kg of extra load - 3 litres water, RT40 Arkel
panniers with lunch and Arkel Tailrider with tools.
 
I was mightily pleased with the trike's performance: no failures, no
punctures (I think the suspension massively protects the tyres), excellent
handling on really treacherous surfaces, excellent ride, appropriate
physical effort. 
 
My front Watts Link scraped perhaps 5 times (need to look at this) and the
rear derailleur scraped perhaps 10 times (not much I can do with 16 inch
wheels and the required gear range - except use an internal gear hub with
more than the current 3 speeds). One front damper also has a glisten of  oil
on its shaft - perhaps a weep past the seal caused by overly high
instantaneous internal pressures on the really big bumps. 
 
Did about 10km on really rough dirt and then the return 10km on the (nice
and smooth!) bitumen road. Tomorrow I'll inspect the (prototype) frame for
cracks and abrasions.
 
Regards,
 
Julian Edgar

The springs are Firestone rolling lip airbags. The choice of this springing
medium is covered in detail at
http://www.autospeed.com/cms/A_108591/article.html . I think that airbags
are superior to any other springs for an HPV. The dampers are separate and
use oil. They are based on Yamaha R1 motorcycle steering dampers. 
 
With carrier, three bidons and pedals, weight is 24kg. (Trike also has
all-wheel brakes and 81 gears.)  
 
Maximum all-up test weight has been 159kg (ie trike at 24kg,  rider at 90kg
and test load at 45kg). This pic shows two wheel testing at full load -

You do some remarkable work. What is the empty weight of the trike at this
point?
 
Also, did you consider using an elastomer suspension instead of the oil
shocks? I ask because I have the last ICE Explorer made. I had it done with
the rear suspension which was a Cane Creek shock but all of Trice's new
models use elastomers.

Actually, to answer in more detail  the question about using elastomers as
springing media, I don't like them for these reasons:
 
If the wheel travel is to be sufficient, elastomers require high motion
ratios in the suspension (that is, a large wheel travel for a small spring
deflection). This in turn creates problems in terms of gaining spring
linearity over a decent range of wheel travel, and means frame and
suspension arm loads are high (sometimes unbelievably high). It also means
that any change in the spring rate (eg by the elastomer changing its loaded
length) results in a big change in ride height. 
 
Elastomers are also not easily adjusted for change in loads. 
 
On the other hand, elastomers have two major advantages over other
approaches - low cost and light weight. Some elastomers also have internal
damping - but (and it's another story), I'd suggest that this is not very
effective. 
 
I like rolling lip airbags because they are relatively light (lighter than
steel springs, for example); are very easily altered in pressure to maintain
ride height, irrespective of load; have no stiction; are easily used with
low motion ratios; and have a linear rate that becomes non-linear only near
max deflection (a characteristic that works really well). They also don't
need rose-joints either end - ie the spring ends don't need to stay in line
and parallel. 
 
Their disadvantages are high cost (but that depends where you source them!),
the need to hold their length captive, and a higher weight than some other
springing media (eg elastomers).

Julian Edgar

I've seen sketches of bicycles and motorcycles, with hubless wheels, for years, but it always seemed to be a solution, looking for a problem.  Given the high side loads on trike hubs and spokes, this could actually be a solution, to a problem.

Certainly, you couldn't ride on anything but a hard surface, with their prototype and not above 2.4mph but they are a bunch of engineering students, not trike riders.  The trike has a ton of other problems too (no sweep back of cross member, right brake exposed etc.).

I can see using rim mounted ring style disk brakes, like some Honda motorcycles in the 80's, to deal with brakes.  Perhaps a shaft drive, with a pinion gear working on the enclosed edge of the wheel.

It isn't a show stopper - the rear sprocket.  A different rim that allows
some more clearance is possible.  As we know from our low trikes the chain
down close to the ground is not that big a deal, just not that close.
Nothing says you have to use rimless on the back if you have them on the
front.

I know the wheel bearings wouldn't last long around here.  Navigating 20cm deep puddles is common, around here, in winter months.

It isn't a show stopper - the rear sprocket.  A different rim that allows some more clearance is possible.  As we know from our low trikes the chain down close to the ground is not that big a deal, just not that close.  Nothing says you have to use rimless on the back if you have them on the front.

Well, my Trice XL and Explorer only have ground clearances of 8.2cm and 17.8cm respectively, so I imagine 20cm puddles could get uncomfortable.

Well, my seat is usually higher, than the puddles.  The trick is having enough speed to get through, without pedaling or splashing one's self.

Hi Folks,
 
Went for a ride the other day on prototype suspension trike. 
 
A last minute change of plans (a major bushfire in the area I'd intended to
go to) meant I went straight over the Great Dividing Range on what turned
out for much of the distance to be a fire trail through a national park.
(From Hoskinstown to Braidwood, New South Wales.) 
 
With the longer trip in mind I was packed for 4 days of self-supported
touring, including 15 litres of water, food, spares, etc - 39kg of stuff. 
 
Was very tough - only about 20 kilometres for this section but very steep,
rough, and often wet and slippery dirt. Camped overnight. 
 
I didn't expect the road to turn out to be a fire trail (had poor map and no
phone reception for nav) and I certainly didn't expect it to be so deserted
- no one passed me for 18 hours or so. So I was a bit disconcerted by the
difficulty and lack of other people. Knowing what I now know, I would do it
again, either in the company of others or with an epirb (even a sprained
ankle would have been very dangerous). 
 
Blew seals in all three suspension dampers (need to do more work on the
damping) but had no punctures and no other failures. With 16 inch wheels,
the rear derailleur was at times dragging in the mud - not good. Am now
developing new damping system.

Nice pictures Julian,

It looks like a fun adventure!  We have taken our tadpoles on nasty 
trails like that, but it is difficult.  We have been looking at Ketts 
for offroad and sticking to onroad with our non-suspended tadpoles.

I am looking forward to your next tests!

Hi Julian,

Are the damper seals replaceable?  If you want to stick with the 16" rear wheel, maybe an internal hub would suite better.

I am currently experimenting with the air springs being used as fluid
displacers. In this approach the miniature Firestone airsprings are filled
with water. The displaced water moves through tubes to an accumulator tank
where the water bears against a rubber diaphragm pressurised by air. 

This approach allows suspension interconnection and also allows damping
valves to be placed in the interconnection lines. It is very similar to the
1970s BMC Hydragas system, except using air pressure rather than nitrogen
pressure. 

Damping can be very easily driver adjusted, ride height can be easily
adjusted, and damping can be configured to remain constant in rate with
differing loads. 

I have chosen to interconnect the front wheels, reducing roll stiffness
(roll stiffness is provided only by a leading arm torsion bar) but giving
potentially soft one-wheel bump performance. When going hard, the damping is
manually adjusted upwards to provide a 'sports' suspension performance.
After experimenting with a variety of approaches, I am using simple taps in
the fluid lines to allow simultaneous adjustment of bump and rebound
damping. 

I am using commercially available accumulators, normally used on boat
pressurised water systems. In my machine the max air pressure is only 30
psi; the accumulators are rated to 120 psi. Each accumulator weighs about
400g; including water the total weight of the suspension springing/damping
system is about 3kg. 

So my system comprises two front air springs filled with water,
interconnected and then joined to a pressure tank with adjustable taps on
these interconnecting pipes. At the rear, a single accumulator tank and
displacer are used, again with an interconnecting tube with adjustable tap. 

My problems now are in getting my lash-up plumbing to seal properly, but
first results look promising. At least there are no sliding seals in this
system!

Julian Edgar

Hi Julian,

Are the damper seals replaceable?  If you want to stick with the 16" rear
wheel, maybe an internal hub would suite better.

Hi Folks,

Went for a ride the other day on prototype suspension trike. 

A last minute change of plans (a major bushfire in the area I'd intended to
go to) meant I went straight over the Great Dividing Range on what turned
out for much of the distance to be a fire trail through a national park.
(From Hoskinstown to Braidwood, New South Wales.) 

With the longer trip in mind I was packed for 4 days of self-supported
touring, including 15 litres of water, food, spares, etc - 39kg of stuff. 

Was very tough - only about 20 kilometres for this section but very steep,
rough, and often wet and slippery dirt. Camped overnight. 

I didn't expect the road to turn out to be a fire trail (had poor map and no
phone reception for nav) and I certainly didn't expect it to be so deserted
- no one passed me for 18 hours or so. So I was a bit disconcerted by the
difficulty and lack of other people. Knowing what I now know, I would do it
again, either in the company of others or with an epirb (even a sprained
ankle would have been very dangerous). 

Blew seals in all three suspension dampers (need to do more work on the
damping) but had no punctures and no other failures. With 16 inch wheels,
the rear derailleur was at times dragging in the mud - not good. Am now
developing new damping system.

this on going drama of the off-road trike could only happen between folks who refer to that small island off the coast of france as the mother country.  since the invention of the dune buggy in our country we no longer refer to the 18th century as the period of profound mechanical invention and technical marvel.
