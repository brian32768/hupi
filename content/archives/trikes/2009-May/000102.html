<PRE>Today I road about 3 miles around the neighborhood.  It rides fine except when you want to turn.  It then becomes rather unstable and of course wants to lift the outside wheel.  So as of now it is good as long as I go straight or very slowly around corners

When I made it I narrowed the frame by 4 inches, from 32 to 28 inches.  That may be part of the problem.  I will expand it back to 32 inches.  However, I am wondering if since it has a middle drive wheel if the bike thinks the rear wheelbase is only 14 inches.  Anyone have any ideas?  Also the outboard wheels are 2 1/2 inches behind the drive wheel.  Could this contribute to the problem?

Any ideas freely  accepted. 

Thanks,

Ed Logan
