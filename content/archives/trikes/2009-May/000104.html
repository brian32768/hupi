</I>A trike is only stable while (simplistic view) the Centre of Gravity 
(CofG) is acting within the triangle formed by the 3 wheels - when you 
go in a straight line, the CofG acts downwards (and a bit backward when 
you accelerate/a bit forward when you brake (under heavy breaking, it 
is possible to ground the chainwheel on some trikes)).  When you 
corner, the CofG acts to the outside - and the faster you are going and 
the sharper you are turning, the more to the outside, until the inside 
wheel lifts and, if you do not straighten, the trike flips.

So, you need the seat as low as possible, and (on a delta trike) the 
rear wheels not too far back and as wide apart as possible - the 
Kettweisel (the only delta trike I am familiar with) has the rear 
wheels just behind the seat and is remarkably stable - at a cycle 
centre for disabled people I help at, there are 4 Kettwiesels, and is 6 
years there has only been one accident on a Kettweisel (as far as I 
know) when a carer completely lost the plot when it came to steering 
and instead of following the track round a bend, went straight on and 
ended up in a stream - even here the Kettweisel stayed upright (though 
the carer was VERY wet!). There are a wide variety of clients including 
school kids who sometimes ride the Kettweisels with great enthusiasm, 
and the only problem is the need to replace the rear tyres regularly as 
a result of over enthusiastic braking.
