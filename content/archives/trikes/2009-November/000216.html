<PRE>&gt;<i> Guys,
</I>&gt;<i> A few years ago, I bought Rick's trike plans ( and the up-date).  
</I>&gt;<i> Downloaded them on my pc , had intended to print someday.
</I>&gt;<i> Pc crashed, wrote to Rick and explained what happened. Asked for  
</I>&gt;<i> free copy of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HE NEVER REPLIED!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Resent same letter last week, still NO REPLY!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have any of you been in touch with him? Is he still kicking? Who  
</I>&gt;<i> owns the company now? How do I get in touch for an answer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,      Leo Roderick Guajardo, 11                     in  
</I>&gt;<i> Dallas.

Leo,

Sorry about the communication problem.  If anyone wishes to email me, do so
at trikesrcool at yahoo.com or rhorwitz at hellbentcycles.com. It's been
several years since I've participated in the IHPVA list, so I don't monitor
this venue frequently. I try to respond to all my emails, but sometimes
these messages can get caught in my spam filter and I never see them.

Hellbent Cycle Works is still alive and well, but Hellbent Cycles Inc has
been dissolved.  At the moment, I sell only recumbent trike plans and have
recently released the Mk III plans that add the last features found on the
Spitfire, including a larger 26&quot; rear wheel, segmented frame and red lines
to the plans for constructing it out of steel.  I have delegated my parts
and supplies to Frank Takacs at <A HREF="http://www.gottrikes.com,">http://www.gottrikes.com,</A> as Frank is an
excellent machinist and is also an accomplished Designer/Engineer as well.  


Best regards,
 

Rickey M. Horwitz
Hellbent Cycle Works
