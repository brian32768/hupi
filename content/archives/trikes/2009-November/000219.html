Subject: [trikes] 304 MILES-39 DAYS VS 7.5 HOURS









My tour was 304 miles. Just 8 miles from  Natchez(another state) 39 days
counting about 6 rain days and then 7.5 hours by car. I had to cut my trip
short as my son in law is drawing his lasts breaths as I write this. His
kidneys are already shutting down. He lives next door to me and is dying
from pancreatic cancer. He is only about 58 and I don't think it has sunk in
yet for me. I got home yesterday afternoon after driving a U Haul van with
my trike and trailer in it for 7.5 hours. I would rather pedal for 39 days.
I was in Ferriday La and was to get my bottom bracket fixed yesterday in
Natchez but instead had to come home. 
 
I thought I would be sleeping in my tent every night but finally got smarter
and have slept on church pews, on the floor of a preachers office, in the
large fellowship buildings at Baptist churches, behind churches in my tent,
on a front porch in pouring rain for 2 days, in the woods 2 days hiding in
pouring rain, in a church members house, in an old parsonage that is now a
youth building, in the yard of a drunk after being refused the yard of an
Assembly of God church and 2 churches put me up in motels,In a little
apartment like house next to a church.. When one fellow found out why I was
riding he paid for me to stay in an rv park in the rv section. My only
campground with the elite. I did stay in a Natl forest but it was on the
hiway and I was the only one there.  I am going around to different Baptist
churches and asking if I can give my testimony. Now I am in my warm bed
until at least the 10th of Dec. If my sons test results for colon cancer
come back positive I guess I will stay here and take care of him and my
grandson. I hope its not because I can be ready to roll in a matter of
minutes. I will go thru my stuff and change some out and add some and had
just sent some home. I almost beat it home.
 
My bottom bracket is slightly loose or whatever. It skips a space or bumps
or whatever you call it. I don't know how to fix it so will have to go to a
bike shop and let them. Is it hard to do or need special tools? I could try
and save me some $$. I spent it all on a van to come home. Over $450.
Ohhhhhh that is so painful. I will have to get back too so will spend more
in a couple week. Might have to get a job on the road to support my habit. I
also had all the spokes in 1 wheel come loose at the same time and that
stopped me in my tracks when I found out. After sitting on the hiway from
9:30 am til 3 pm help finally arrived. I was so glad to see them too. 
 
I have been on hwy 84 just 80 miles or so  east of Waco Tx since I started
this trip. I have stayed on this road all the way. Driving home I am glad I
didn't take the route I had thought about as the roads are so sorry. 
 
Kelly, yes the P-style (female pee cup) is an absolute necessity. That is
the best thing ever invented for us ladies to go potty on the road. 
 
I can't wait to get back out on the road. I could live there forever if I
had someone to talk to at the end of the day. Being alone all the time is
not my thing. I really love this riding tho. 
 
I will probably some time in the future write a better version of this trip
but right now its time to go start cooking for tomorrow. Happy Thanksgiving
to all. Fran
