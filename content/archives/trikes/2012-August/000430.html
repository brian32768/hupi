It might be worth it to take it to a local shop that services trikes if you 
 have one nearby.  Bleeding is no fun!!!

Message-ID:  &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/trikes">502D0346.4010905 at zalonoffice.com</A>&gt;
Content-Type: text/plain;  charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;; Format=&quot;flowed&quot;

The other day, after a fairly  short 10 mile ride on my GTO, I noticed a 
chafing on my bottom, in the  center, just above my sit bones. And the 
next morning, after scratching  the area (because it had become itchy), I 
discovered that my underpants  were extremely bloody. I have previously 
felt chafing in the same spot,  but it never was this bad, and it never 
before bled.

I may have an  explanation for this unpleasant condition: a year ago, the 
elastic that  held the mesh seat in place broke, and I repaired it with 
some bungee cord  I purchased from a sports shop. However, I don't think 
I did a great job:  the mesh eventually folded over itself in a couple of 
places, INCLUDING  EXACTLY WHERE THE CHAFING OCCURRED. A photo of the 
seat (showing the  wrinkling) is attached.

Has anyone else had the same problem? For the  time being, my &quot;cure&quot; is 
to cover the seat with some yoga mat rubber  material . . . and it seems 
to have worked. And my next venture is to just  purchase a new mesh seat. 
But I'm curious to see if anyone else has had  the same  problem.

Yes, and the solution for me was to re-apply the seat  mesh paying much
more attention to both getting it crease-free on top and  making sure there
wasn't anything poking up under the seat (I had a cable  tie in a poor
location and the ~1mm edge was annoying me). With one trike I  ended up
adding ties between the front of the mesh and the seat supports to  stop
the mesh sliding up over time. I didn't bleed from it  though.

With my rotovelo I've redone the seat padding to match the  curve of my
back better (it's easy to stuff extra foam under the supplied  pad), and
now that I've done that I'm thinking about putting a lower back  pad
between the mesh and shock cord on my next mesh seat. It won't be  as
effective as reshaping the seat supports, but it's a lot easier to  do.

Personally, I feel the need for a gap  between the back and the base of a 
seat.  The GS seat does not work for  me at all. If I felt the need to try to 
make it work, I would think about  trying to make the mesh into two pieces; 
back and base.

I found it was easier to  just lace those parts separately. It's very easy
to pick a dividing point  and end up with a knot at the front of the seat
and another at the top. I  found that was especially useful on more upright
seats where the force on  them is quite  different.
