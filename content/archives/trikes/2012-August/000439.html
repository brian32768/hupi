<PRE>I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem with Dura-Ace
9-Speed bar end shifters.

Story follows:
Have had my Greenspeed-GTO since 2005.  In 2010 the rear shifter was
replaced after replacing all the other rear drive components. I purchased
the shifter from a LBS (Inside Out Sports) and got it adjusted to shift OK
without too many problems.    I find that with recumbents the adjustment of
the shifter is a real pain because you cannot turn the crank and see what
is happening at the cogs at the same time -- maybe someone has a solution
for this -- I have thought of a mirror, a video camera or a small motor to
slowly turn the crank.

So, after about 50 to 100 miles of riding with everything going well the
shifter suddenly lost its indexing.  I decided to fix it after letting is
sit for a few months over the hot summer we have had in NC.  When I removed
the shifter I noticed that the plastic cover was cracked and when fully
removed the small circular indexing plate fell out in two pieces.  This
seems to explain why the indexing failed.  I went back the to the LBS and
asked if there was any warranty.  They were not too encouraging about a
warranty and did not have a new set in stock.  So I ordered a new set from
Amazon. The box and parts from Amazon appeared to be genuine Shimano.  I
found with this unit that I could not find an adjustment that would allow
good shifting for both small and large cogs.  I removed the chain and
looked at the alignment at each index point and found that the derailleur
was not stepping correctly.  Also noticed that the shifter seemed to have
10 index points rather than 9.   After several attempts to see if there was
some compromise adjustment I gave up.

 Then decided that since I did not really know what indexing Shimano was
using, I would setup a fixture to try to find out.  Clamped the shifter in
a vise and connected a short piece of housing and ran a cable which was
suspending a weight of about 8 lbs.  The value of 8 lbs was found by using
a spring scale to pull on the shifter cable with no chain -- I found that
it took about 8-10lbs to move the derailleur and about 5 lbs to hold at a
fixed position.  Then clamped a small pointer on the cable and marked the
index points with a fine pen.  I was surprised to find that there really
were 10 index points and that there was noticeable hysteresis when shifting
in opposite directions.  The inner steps were about 0.1&quot; but the end steps
were about 0.15&quot;.  Gave up and thought about changing to SRAM Grip-Shift,
but would have to change the derailleur also.

Then about a week after contacting the LBS they said they had a new set of
shifters for warranty replacement. The first thing I did was to setup the
new shifter in the fixture I had made to compare the indexing of the unit
from Amazon.  This new shifter looked much better. The hysteresis was much
smaller and there were 9 index positions.  I still saw that the indexing at
the end points was larger at the ends.  About 0.15&quot; for 9-8 and about 0.13&quot;
for 1-2.  I guess this is a design feature.  So, installed this unit and
after a bit of fiddling with the adjustment was able to get shifting to
work well.

Has anyone had a similar experience?  I have always expected very high
standards from Shimano.
