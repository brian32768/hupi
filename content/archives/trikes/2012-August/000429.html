<PRE>Hi Jules,

I had a similar problem with the carbon seat on my Evo-K, but this was fixed by drilling a hole in the seat so there was no material pressing against the rub spot...
And then improved by adding a ventisit cushion.

&gt;<i> The other day, after a fairly short 10 mile ride on my GTO, I noticed a chafing on my bottom, in the center, just above my sit bones. And the next morning, after scratching the area (because it had become itchy), I discovered that my underpants were extremely bloody. I have previously felt chafing in the same spot, but it never was this bad, and it never before bled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I may have an explanation for this unpleasant condition: a year ago, the elastic that held the mesh seat in place broke, and I repaired it with some bungee cord I purchased from a sports shop. However, I don't think I did a great job: the mesh eventually folded over itself in a couple of places, INCLUDING EXACTLY WHERE THE CHAFING OCCURRED. A photo of the seat (showing the wrinkling) is attached.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone else had the same problem? For the time being, my &quot;cure&quot; is to cover the seat with some yoga mat rubber material . . . and it seems to have worked. And my next venture is to just purchase a new mesh seat. But I'm curious to see if anyone else has had the same problem.
