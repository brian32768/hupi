<PRE>The other day, after a fairly short 10 mile ride on my GTO, I noticed a 
chafing on my bottom, in the center, just above my sit bones. And the 
next morning, after scratching the area (because it had become itchy), I 
discovered that my underpants were extremely bloody. I have previously 
felt chafing in the same spot, but it never was this bad, and it never 
before bled.

I may have an explanation for this unpleasant condition: a year ago, the 
elastic that held the mesh seat in place broke, and I repaired it with 
some bungee cord I purchased from a sports shop. However, I don't think 
I did a great job: the mesh eventually folded over itself in a couple of 
places, INCLUDING EXACTLY WHERE THE CHAFING OCCURRED. A photo of the 
seat (showing the wrinkling) is attached.

Has anyone else had the same problem? For the time being, my &quot;cure&quot; is 
to cover the seat with some yoga mat rubber material . . . and it seems 
to have worked. And my next venture is to just purchase a new mesh seat. 
But I'm curious to see if anyone else has had the same problem.
