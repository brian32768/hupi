Yes, and the solution for me was to re-apply the seat mesh paying much
more attention to both getting it crease-free on top and making sure there
wasn't anything poking up under the seat (I had a cable tie in a poor
location and the ~1mm edge was annoying me). With one trike I ended up
adding ties between the front of the mesh and the seat supports to stop
the mesh sliding up over time. I didn't bleed from it though.

With my rotovelo I've redone the seat padding to match the curve of my
back better (it's easy to stuff extra foam under the supplied pad), and
now that I've done that I'm thinking about putting a lower back pad
between the mesh and shock cord on my next mesh seat. It won't be as
effective as reshaping the seat supports, but it's a lot easier to do.
