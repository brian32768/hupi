<PRE>Thanks to all for the responses and  the info.

The pedal stick sounds like a good solution.

Thanks for reminding me of the Sheldon Brown site -- with all the people
the world could do without, why did he have to pass-away?

The bent rider online info showed this is not an uncommon problem.  Sorry
to see that the 9-speed Dura-Ace is obsolete.

I do not remember too well,  but I think I tried to put the shifter in
friction mode when indexing broke, but it did not work well.   Really like
indexing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem with Dura-Ace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 9-Speed bar end shifters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Story follows:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have had my Greenspeed-GTO since 2005.  In 2010 the rear shifter was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replaced after replacing all the other rear drive components. I purchased
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the shifter from a LBS (Inside Out Sports) and got it adjusted to shift OK
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without too many problems.    I find that with recumbents the adjustment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the shifter is a real pain because you cannot turn the crank and see what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is happening at the cogs at the same time -- maybe someone has a solution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for this -- I have thought of a mirror, a video camera or a small motor to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slowly turn the crank.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, after about 50 to 100 miles of riding with everything going well the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shifter suddenly lost its indexing.  I decided to fix it after letting is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sit for a few months over the hot summer we have had in NC.  When I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the shifter I noticed that the plastic cover was cracked and when fully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removed the small circular indexing plate fell out in two pieces.  This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to explain why the indexing failed.  I went back the to the LBS and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asked if there was any warranty.  They were not too encouraging about a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> warranty and did not have a new set in stock.  So I ordered a new set from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Amazon. The box and parts from Amazon appeared to be genuine Shimano.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> found with this unit that I could not find an adjustment that would allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good shifting for both small and large cogs.  I removed the chain and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looked at the alignment at each index point and found that the derailleur
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was not stepping correctly.  Also noticed that the shifter seemed to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 10 index points rather than 9.   After several attempts to see if there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some compromise adjustment I gave up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Then decided that since I did not really know what indexing Shimano was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using, I would setup a fixture to try to find out.  Clamped the shifter in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a vise and connected a short piece of housing and ran a cable which was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suspending a weight of about 8 lbs.  The value of 8 lbs was found by using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a spring scale to pull on the shifter cable with no chain -- I found that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it took about 8-10lbs to move the derailleur and about 5 lbs to hold at a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixed position.  Then clamped a small pointer on the cable and marked the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> index points with a fine pen.  I was surprised to find that there really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were 10 index points and that there was noticeable hysteresis when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shifting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in opposite directions.  The inner steps were about 0.1&quot; but the end steps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were about 0.15&quot;.  Gave up and thought about changing to SRAM Grip-Shift,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but would have to change the derailleur also.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then about a week after contacting the LBS they said they had a new set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shifters for warranty replacement. The first thing I did was to setup the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new shifter in the fixture I had made to compare the indexing of the unit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from Amazon.  This new shifter looked much better. The hysteresis was much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smaller and there were 9 index positions.  I still saw that the indexing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end points was larger at the ends.  About 0.15&quot; for 9-8 and about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 0.13&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for 1-2.  I guess this is a design feature.  So, installed this unit and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after a bit of fiddling with the adjustment was able to get shifting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone had a similar experience?  I have always expected very high
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standards from Shimano.
