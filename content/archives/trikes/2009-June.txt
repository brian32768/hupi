Does anyone have any experience riding both trikes? Is there a difference in speed that could be noticed?? Would one be much faster for touring then the other??

Thanks Fran

At a given weight it is the engine that counts. A light delta would be
faster in some circumstances than a heavy tadpole, or vice versa.  It is
less important for extended flat rides.A bad fit - too large or too small
for the driver - would be trouble.  The smaller you are physically, the more
interest you should have in a lighter weight cycle regardless of # wheels or
their arrangement.

There are more high quality tadpoles to choose from, but there are good
deltas. Anura by Greenspeed may be the lighter weight side of deltas.

Ultimately, if you want to ride faster you need to practice in an an
organized manner.   If you ride the same distance three times in a week at
roughly the same speed, you will be able to add a few more miles or mph the
4th ride.  My PT doc told me any hard work we do is an insult to our body if
we only do it once or twice a week.  At one time I ramped up pretty fast
riding 2 or 3 times midweek with a single long ride on the weekend.

There is no way around this, but on the other hand, if you do the work, you
get the reward.  Regularity is a guaranteed source of positive results.

Yeah - 3 times/week is the rule...
I've noticed in the past that exercising twice per week seems to  
maintain fitness, three times a week is needed to increase it.

No opinion on speed (I ride tadpoles, so am biased towards tadpoles) 
but for touring, luggage carrying on a delta can be an issue - on a 
tadpole there is (normally) space above the rear wheel for a rack on 
which it is relatively easy to load full touring gear (including 
camping gear), while on a delta it is much harder - unless it is a load 
carrying machine with a load platform behind the seat - when the trike 
will be intrinsically heavier and so slower anyway.  I have done 
several long tours ( 1,500 to 2,000 miles) on my Greenspeed or my Trice 
XXL with all the luggage on the rear rack.  I have even done shorter 
(500 mile) tours with camping gear on the rack on my Trice Micro, but 
that is probably beyond the reasonable load for the rack on the Micro.  
I have also done long tours on my Greenspeed or my Trice XXL with my 
trailer, where loading luggage is much less of a problem - in fact my 
main problem then is carrying too much - I have returned from Holland 
with 40 extra maps or with 20 or more bottles of beer - the 'hill' out 
of the North Shields (Newcastle upon Tyne) ferry terminal, which is 
normally easy, can be very difficult after several weeks in Holland 
where 'hills' are usually only 2 or 3 metres climb to cross a dyke.

I have ridden Kettwiesels with no luggage, and cannot say I noticed any 
speed difference either way compared to riding my tadpoles with no 
luggage.

Fran, I have always found tadpoles faster than deltas.  But now that I am older and have great difficulty getting out of tadpoles I ride my Kettwiesel and before that my Greenway.  Having said that, except for my Windcheeta the difference was only 1 to 2 miles an hour.  Also now that I have gotten older (70 next week) I find I am not that fast on anything.  10-12 on the Kett, 12-14 on the Gold Rush and 11-13 on my Metro.  So I have quit worrying about speed and just ride along and enjoy the scenery.  My mileage has dropped from 100 miles/wk to 80 but I have quit sweating it.  

My advice, ride what feels best to you, don't worry about the speed and enjoy the ride.

To have an equal chance to safely avoid a sudden road hazard, or  
other surprise on tour,  the delta has to be physically larger, which  
will make it slower.  It is also poorly shaped for a good streamlined  
enclosure.

I have a Greenspeed GT3 (tadpole) and a Hase Kettwiesel (delta). The GT3 is slightly faster downhill because it has a more reclined seat, hence better aerodynamics. The Kettwiesel is slightly faster uphill because it has a more upright seat, hence better use of muscles. Overall, it's not enough to make any difference. 

If you want to go fast, get a strong motor. A fast rider on a slow bike will beat a slow rider on a fast bike every time.

When the fast rider rides a slow bike
does the rider arrive first? Sounds painful.

On the other hand, a slow rider on a fast bike sounds dangerous.

No doubt there are plenty of fast Tadpole Trikes on the market.  As  
for a fast Delta, don't forget the RANS Trizard.  Very interesting  
design and I find it to be competitive speed wise with some pretty  
quick Tadpole Trikes.  All the Trizard needs is a good pair of  
aerodynamic fenders on the rear wheels.  They could look cool, add  
speed and keep your elbows from inadvertently contacting the wheels  
while riding.

For what it's worth, I find that on average, I am at least 2 mph  
faster on a fast, two wheeled recumbent.  Something like a Bacchetta  
Corsa or a RANS Force 5.

Heard a rumor that Bacchetta is working on a long wheel base, Tadpole,  
leaning design Trike?  Could be fun!

One more thing, while we are talking about speed.  When you enclose  
the Trike, like a Greenspeed Glyde, Go-One, Quest or any of the other  
Velomobiles on the market, that's where it starts to really get fun.   
On flat terrain it's hard to believe the speeds you can get up to  
without much power input.  As soon as the road heads down, it's  
amazing!  On long climbs, electric assist would be nice ;^)

On my last visit to the RANS headquarters in HAYS Kansas, I saw a cad  
drawing of a Trizard with a full body.  Very nice looking design, it  
even had a little wing like spoiler on the back with solar panels on  
it for?  As an aircraft manufacturer, RANS certainly has the  
production capability and knowledge to produce an awesome, light  
weight Velomobile, no doubt about that in my mind.  If offered, I'd  
order one tomorrow!

Has anyone ridden or even seen a Glyde? And has anyone taken any photos

We have a Kettwiesel, some Anuras, and we have temporary possession  
of a Sun X3 and have recently arranged for a couple of Sun EZ-3's to  
get to some folks who needed them, with us trying them out on the  
way.  Our tadpole collection includes a Greenspeed GTO and some Cab- 
Bikes.  We have rented several other tadpoles for multi-day tours  
(Catrike, GT-3, Scorpion) and test-ridden a lot of others.

I don't really notice a difference in speed, but our physical  
conditioning has changed (improved) over this time, and of course the  
amount of luggage varies a lot.

It's true that it's easier to transport luggage with the standard  
racks on tadpoles, but the new Anura rack will hold one standard  
pannier, and we have been using a trailer behind the Kettwiesel.

In the last week, I've ridden to work on both the Greenspeed GTO and  
an Anura.  It really feels much better in traffic to be a little  
higher up on the delta.

We have been happy touring on trails with the tadpoles, but on roads  
with traffic, we really prefer the deltas.  Besides, you can hook the  
deltas together.

I've seen one but not sat in it let alone ridden it (come on, they
know me), and the interior is nothing special. I don't know if they've
sold one yet, but I expect it's only a matter of time. I have photos
somewhere that I can dig out, give me a while.

Do you have specific questions?

It doesn't seem like many people tour on deltas.  The Anura seems quite 
untested on tours, and lately I have read complaints about the Ketts not 
being durable enough for touring.

The tadpoles usually seem to be faster downhill and into a headwind.  
Uphill they seem similar.  On soft surfaces I am much slower on a 
tadpole.  

With that said, I don't think the speed differences are significant. 

I do plan to try a Kett or Anura on tour, I just haven't decided which one.

Hi
To the persons with hase delta trikes, keitts, has anyone used the hase
factory electric assist on their trikes and how do you like it? Or have you
heard of anyone that has done it?
Also, if not has anyone installed Heinzman electric on front wheel and
results. Have still not dealt with doing the electric assist. Really need to
do it because of physical problems. But know it is expensive and want to do
what works the best and is durable, Plus I have to find a person
knowledgeable to help install in NE USA

Thanks Judy

My best experience in adding electric assist to delta trikes has been
to install a good hub-motor in the front wheel.

Given the light wheel loading on the front of most deltas, are there problems with the wheel slipping under power, or does the weight of the motor negate that?

The weight of the motor certainly helps. In most occasions of regular
road use where you need assist there is no problem. If accelerating in
sand it will likely slip somewhat, or when climbing a hill with
gravel. Again, with most road use there is no issue at all. I haven't
electrified all models of delta trikes though, just some upright
trikes and my own homebuilt recumbent delta and a Sun EZ3. The
simplicity of a hub motor installation makes it a very attractive
option compared to other alternatives.

Hi, I forwarded the request for electric motors to my friend here because I knew he had, had one and here is his response. Maybe it will be helpful to some wondering. Fran

Subject: electric assist hub motor



this is walt at wkennethw at hotmail.com and a friend sent me a copy of your information request about hub motors.? let me tell my experiences and maybe it will help in your decision.? at 15 or 20 pounds?the hub?motor does hold the front wheel down enough to give you traction you need and pulls you straight, though your steering is changed and the weight of the motor makes the wheel flop to what ever side you steer but i overcome that ok.? i bought one, had a heavy duty tube and tire put onto the wheel, had?the hub motor?installed, loved it and it lasted 3 months. i was told no warrantees when things went sour. later i was told batteries don't last long time, that you can't leave them out in the cold or pull to much weight, or draw them down to much. i was told mine were shot in the spring and bought new batteries $145.? still not work.? was told my charger was shot.? a new one cost me $75. still not work, was told the controller was burnt out because i have my wife's ez-3 hooked onto my usx and burnt out the controller, so a new one was bought for $95, and still not work.? was told the thumb switch may be bad 
and was told the motor might have something burnt out in it.? i gave up and i stopped the cash flow and removed the motor and rest of the parts. 
?
wife and i are handicapped due to age, also arthritis for me and stroke for her so the want of a motor assist.? if i pedaled with it i got almost 2 hours on a charge.
?
if i were getting a hub motor again i would figure a complete new one each spring. $300 to $500 each for a few months of ease.
?
our friend and editor 'wo' of the errc magazine found and sent information to me about hub motor problems. in a nutshell the hub motor is designed for a 2 wheel bike and a 175 pound rider though many tell you different to sell them.? found that you cannot drain the battery down below a certain level and no gage was included in?my package to know when?i exceed that point.? found batteries don't last long, found you can't start up without pedaling first, found on long hills there is to much draw of power unless you pedal hard with it and not throttle it up to hard.? 
?
i then was talked into putting a gasoline motor on my usx to help pull us and our trikes with accessories and loaded panniers, totaling out at 600 pounds, up our hill and on the level when tired.? i found a man who worked out of his garage installing bike gas motors, and one was put on my usx, it was to powerful, the job was to sloppy. the welds were not safe, the motor power curve is at high=2
0of speed, over 20 mph plus, in one test of the throttle it shot me up to over 30 mph and tried to pull the front wheel to the right during full acceleration, and was way to loud.? with the extra added controls, all?run by hand,??the brakes, shifters, clutch, throttle and brakes really keeps your hands busy and unsafe. pedaling the usx with the clutch disengaged still made the engine chain to axle revolve, creating friction against pedaling when traveling with motor off so you can't run through the gears.? the motor is coming off and i have hired a man to weld my usx frame back that the engine installer notched out.
?
if i was ever to use a gasoline motor again it would need to be with a reduction gear box so you could have a real small, low rpm, well muffled, ?quiet motor and have the power needed at a slower speed like 10 to 20 mph.
?
i found that lightfoot recumbents of montanna makes a bike trailer with a gas motor under it which will push you up the hills and ease your traveling when the trailer is loaded.? i would someday like to try one of these out or talk to folks that have one.
?
all is not lost though as i found you can have your small front cassette gear ring removed and a smaller one put in its place, then you can pedal up steeper hills with? much less effort,?though at only half speed in that range.
?
i have a sun ez-3 usx, my favorite, a sun ez-3, my wife's, much easier to pedal, lighter,?
and just bought a sun x-3 sx, to be my solo traveling recumbent in hills as well as on the?level.? ? wife and i go on health rides, errands, and pleasure rides.? on the usx i have a arnold adapter coupling so i can hook the front forks of wife's ez-3 into the coupling and off we go.? when she gets tired of pedaling she rest while i pedal us along.? this works out great for? handicap folk as well as in crowds of people as well because i can control the speed and steer through the crowds.? we ride right up to the super market to get groaceries, parking in hash marked areas, so we not walk so far across the parking lot that we are tired out in the store.
?
hope i have helped you,



Walt Wermuth

My understanding is that all of the 'first production' Glydes should  
be ready in August. I've got one on order but was too late to be in  
the 'first batch' so have first seat in the 'second batch'.

I assume you've seen the Glyde news page here: http://greenspeed.com.au/Glyde.News.html

I have to admit to curiosity about this.   But my mind goes to all the
things that could be wrong about it.

A decent hub motor for trike assist should not be as heavy as
15-20lbs. More like 10-14lbs would do the trick.

Batteries are certainly important. Heavy (old-tech) Sealed Lead Acid
batteries do require some care and cannot be expected to last more
than about one season. Much more suitable Lithium batteries are now
widely available and will give reliable (and lightweight) power for
many seasons.

Your constant failures and replacements point to the possibility that
your electric component vendor may not have the experience you seek.
It is really important to understand the systems available and the
intended use and to match them accordingly. In some cases trying to
save a few dollars leads to a lot of heartache.

Yes, each part of the system could potentially fail at some time,
including batteries, controller, throttle, charger etc. The hub motors
themselves rarely fail. To ensure reliability again it is important to
match the right components to the requirements. I have set up many
(hundreds?) of customers with good, reliable systems. Not all have
been perfect at all times but in every case after-sales support has
been paramount. Make sure your vendor understands what they are doing
and can give support and reliable repairs or phone support when/if
required.

I am sorry that your system did not work out. In just about all cases
though the electric option is WAY more reliable and efficient (and
quiter/cleaner) than the gas alternative. There are simply far fewer
components to give trouble. They are however somewhat harder to
understand for someone who has spent a lifetime getting used to the
parts of internal combustion vehicles. Amps and Watts are simply less
visible than spark plugs and gasoline.

Some years ago I saw a Kettwiesel with a front wheel hub motor - the 
battery was mounted just behind the front wheel under the main tube 
(mounted fore and aft so it did not stick out and interfere with the 
pedals) - with modern batteries the weight is less, but it would still 
help.

When riding an unassisted Kettwiesel I rarely notice wheel slippage - 
though when riding the front of two linked Kettwiesels with the rear 
rider not really pedaling, the front wheel definitely skips from side 
to side when climbing steep hills - this is not really a problem as 
speed is very low in this situation.

We've been seeing these "Transformer" bikes at German and Dutch bike  
shows for 3 or 4 years now -- first a single prototype, then a pre- 
production model, and then what was promised to be a commercial  
version.  I'm not even sure that this one is from the same builder or  
builders.  There has been a lot of interest from recumbent enthusiasts.

Low, streamlined recumbents cut through the killer headwinds on the  
splendid bike paths between north German, Danish, and Dutch cities,  
but when you get into most towns in Europe, you really don't want to  
be that low.  A lot of folks just keep two bikes (or more) for the  
different kinds of riding, but what if you are riding across country  
and into a city?

This truly does answer a question that real cyclists are asking --  
just not very often in the US.

I have designed and ridden both, plus I've ridden fair number of the
different designs and makes.

I think it is really like asking which is faster, the orange or the apple.

There are a number of things which govern the speed of a trike,
roughly in this order.

1. Fitness of the rider.
2. Aerodynamics (drag co-efficient x frontal area)
3. Weight
4. Rolling resistance (mainly tyre design and performance)
5. Ease of control.
6. Rider comfort.
7. Mechanical efficiency.

Of course it will depend on what order of magnitude we are looking at
in the range of variables, but this is an indication of the range of each
variable, and its effect on performance that I have noticed....

The main point is that the layout is not the main feature of the trike.

Does anyone have any experience riding both trikes? Is there a difference in speed that could be noticed?? 
Would one be much faster for touring then the other??

Thanks Fran

Don't leave us hanging Ian.   Which is it, the Orange or the Apple?

My GTR is orange, please say orange!

Has anyone tried an Anura with a front hub motor yet?  Can it be done 
with 16" wheels?  I would assume the Anura might do better than the Kett 
with the rider position being further forward (on slippery roads anyway).

No problem fitting a hub motor to the front.

See. www.greenspeed.com.au/Anura.power.side.1200.jpg 

You just need to choose a front motor with a disc brake mount.

This is a Bafang motor, see :-

www.greenspeed.com.au/Anura.front.1200.jpg

I did not encounter any traction problems, and AFAIK the customer
has been quite happy with the conversion.

The dropouts look pretty sturdy to me. The bafang motor is not powerful enough for breaking it anyway, I guess, however spinout can always be an issue in case the nuts does not hold up to vibrations and forces. Looks great with a flange nut... I use Nord-Lock washers for my hub motor (FYI not bafang on Anura, and a lot more power) and Nord-Lock seems to be a good choice in order to keep things in place, I would not trust other types of lock washers. Does the nut come with the Bafang motor, and what lock washers do they use?

Generally, mounting a hub motor at front on a delta sounds like a good idea. Small wheels are even better, as you get more torque from the hub motor that way and generally can use a smaller motor. Well, the motor does not deliver more torque, but you get what I mean. You just have to see that the speed is right so that the bike/trike does not become too slow for your needs. The speed of the motor can be controlled by several ways, either by its construction electrically, or by gearing inside the hub (in case it is a geared hub motor), or by voltage applied. The right choice requires knowledge and insight about electrical motors and batteries ratings etc.

Have people tried one of the motors that drives through the gears (like 
Cyclone, or the Elation here is Australia)? Seems that would take a lot 
of the essential compromise out of using a hub motor, esp. on a vehicle 
that naturally used a wider speed range than a conventional bicycle. My 
own experience with hub motors, and that of others I've talked to, is 
that they're almost never in the right gear - they're either overrunning 
or struggling.

Well, the motor does not deliver more torque, but you get what I mean. You just have to see that the speed is right so that the bike/trike does not become too slow for your needs. The speed of the motor can be controlled by several ways, either by its construction electrically, or by gearing inside the hub (in case it is a geared hub motor), or by voltage applied. The right choice requires knowledge and insight about electrical motors and batteries ratings etc.

This might be the ideal snow and ice trike.  I tried a recumbent 2-wheeler with a hub motor in the front wheel and regular pedal power in the rear, and it was great on ice.  It climbed up an icy hill with that all-wheel drive.  An Anura with both rear wheels powered (which is terrific on icy hills anyway) and then with a hub motor in front ought to be unstoppable.  

Would it be possible to have a front wheel built for an Anura with the hub motor, but to switch out?  I could imagine putting it on (with a studded tyre) for winter use, and taking it off for nice-weather riding.

Yes, Giles, I've found putting the motor through the gears is more
efficient, and gives you a much wider speed range.

However there is a temptation to use the extra power to increase
one's top speed, as well as having assistance with the hills, and
this conciderably shortens one's range! Simply because the power
requirement varies as the CUBE of the speed.

For details of my set up, please see :-

Yes, the Anura has 75% of its weight on the two rear drive wheels,
and this is why it is so good on ice. The latest hub motors are what
they call "non-hall sensor" which means they only have a three wire
connection, which makes it easier to have a plug close to the motor,
and makes removal easier. So it would be easy and quick to swap
the powered wheel for a plain wheel.

I have tried both through gears (Cyclone) and hubmotor. With a motor through the gears you can get the job done with much less power and a much smaller and lighter motor, but it is harder to mount and the gearing and chain takes away some of the efficiency. 

Direct drive hub motors are nice because they are very quiet, easy to mount and use, reliable and they are very efficient at the sweet spot which can make up for the lower efficiency at lower speeds. 

The best of two worlds is probably geared hub motors. They make use of a reduction gear inside to get higher torque and/or a lighter motor for the same power. At the same time, they get a bit less peak efficiency because of the gearing. 

It is often best to keep the speed near the average speed that one tends to use. If that is 25 km/h, for example, I see no use of a hub motor that tops out at 50 km/h, and a hub motor that is good at maintaining 25 km/h and that is selected properly will probably be ok for most situations. But you will need a larger and stronger hub motor to compensate for a through-the-gears system.

Most that complain about electric assist expect it to behave like a moped or motorbike and not as an assisted bicycle. To, me, that is not assist anymore.

... the most awsome application was using Cyclone (through the gears and with saggy batteries so 15-25 A yielded a power of around 200-300 W) on a velomobile. The small wheels on a velomobile makes it less useful on tracks with bad surface, but the assist, in spite of low power, makes all the difference. Tracks that I very reluctantly use with pedal only was enjoyable with assist. The more even power from the assist makes it possible to climb tracks uphill that is so steep and with such dirt that you would normally just stop midway spinning while pedalling. With just a touch of assist, the velomobile flies up that impossible hill...

Subject: [trikes] replacement for Bion-X
Message-ID: <2a9f18440906221312r6327015bwf3eaf507d2386b9@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X.  I
installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago for my
wife.  I got what info I could from internet sources to make a decision.  No
one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time.   I was
encouraged that I had made the right decision  when I saw that Wizwheelz
offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but now I
don't see this option on their web site.

Problems are:
The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is disconnected.
Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8 minutes to
reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using the
throttle when running too slow.   Recently, got into mode running at 18mph,
and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.

Like about BionX
1. It is a complete system.  Not too difficult to install on the TT-3.6 --
even though it was never designed for this.
2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster riders.

Do not like about BionX
1. Heavy.   Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy.   Weight bias to
rear.
2. Poor customer service from the factory.  They mostly do not answer e-mail
inquiries.
3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20" wheel the space between rim and
motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire pump.
4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
4. See problems above.

Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering the
distance.  The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the problem
remains.  I think the battery was replaced twice.  A new motor was sent with
26" wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20" rim.

I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time ago. I
believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
customers had problems.  After a while the Bion-X factory became too
difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this message
after I had already purchased one.

I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
problems with BionX.  I seem to be the only one experiencing the system
"lock-up" problem.

I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the drive-train of
the trike without doing a lot of custom work.   I realize that with these
systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub.  Also, most
likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you can with
a hub motor.  Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.

Considering you spent good money for a BionX system and it is still in
warranty I strongly suggest having the system made "as good as new" by
BionX.

Your dealer should be able to have the warranty wheel come back in the
same size as your own. If you have laced a 26" wheel into a 20" hub
you have a speed problem as the 20" version and the 26" versions have
different RPM characteristics.

Based on your description of the problem I strongly suspect a problem
not in the wheel but in the control console. Some systems made about
the time you bough yours have experienced similar problems. It might
even require having the whole system (motor, battery and control
console) components sent back to BionX for evaluation and repair.

This system is too much of an investment (and too good a system) to
remain on the shelf. At least if you have it repaired you can recoup
some of your investment if you choose a different system because it is
in high demand and holds its value well.

It will be hard to find a more suitable system or a lighter system
that your PL-350 (though there are some light ones available none have
quite the "package" of the PL-350). One challenge to overcome might be
how/where you mounted the batteries. This can affect overall trike
balance and/or handling.

If your dealer (always your first step) is not able to resolve these
issues under warranty please feel free to send me your serial numbers
off-list and I will see what I can do regarding BionX service
replacements.

Cyclone is one. I have not had one but have only heard good things about 
it. There may be others similar, that drive the BB axle or the chain 
directly just below it. You keep all the gears or at least the ones at 
the rear hub :-)

Juergen and Giles

Thanks for the replies.

I believe that the Control Head unit has never been replaced.   I did sent
it back to the dealer with the battery in one of the various exchanges, but
they sent the same one back.

You are correct about the 26 vs 20 hub motor setup.  I did lace it up after
discussing with the dealer (apparently he did not know this would be a
problem).   I can't remember the details, but it operated very strangely --
so I changed back to the old motor and then the dealer finally sent the
correct 20" wheel and motor assembly.

My wife had such a bad experience with the BionX system on a recent trip
that she said to remove it from the trike.  But after the first ride without
it, she realized that as troublesome as it is; it is better than no assist.

I don't know what to think about the warranty now.  Since it has been about
1.5yrs since the original purchase, I figured the warranty was gone.
Perhaps since it has never worked properly, I can use that argument for
extending the warranty.

I mounted the battery transversely, immediately behind the seat on the
frame.  Considering my wife's riding style I don't think that weight
distribution is a problem.  Mounting the battery on the top of the boom
seemed to be too obtrusive and the ground clearance underneath the boom did
not look adequate.  I have seen a WW Tour with the battery mounted on the
back of the seat and to one side, but I did not like this because the CG was
higher and offset compared to what I had done

I will contact the dealer again, and see what can be done first.  I
suggested a few times to the dealer to do a full system change-over, but
they never agreed to this.

I will admit that when the BionX operates properly, it is a worthwhile
system.

The BionX warranty is 2yrs on the system and 1yr on the battery. I
suggest pressing the dealer for a full system review/replacement
because if he didn't replace the console and it is still acting up
obviously the system isn't fixed. When working correctly it is a great
system.

I have had the failure you have reported and it was traced to a faulty
control console.

They need to contact BionX service to obtain a Return Authorization.

What bike/ trike to you have the BionX installed on?  Do you also have the
PL-350?

I have again contacted the dealer -- hope he responds...

We were the Bionx distributor for Australia, but after having a number 
of problems, we stopped buying and selling them.

We had problems with the motor casings - three broke.
Also had problems with the battery packs and the consoles.

In fact we have six motors left, but only one working console
left, after the rest were given to customers with console problems.

The main problem we had with Bionx is they failed to answer 
our emails for service after the 2nd casing broke.

So I would suggest that the problem is in your console.

I've been using the Cyclone motor as power assist on my own trike,
and it has worked very well see GS Newsletter 11 for details.

However after one battery failure and a visit to Taiwan, the next
time I ordered, they claimed that they were out of stock, and 
"The price will be much more when you order less than 
30,000USD each time from now."

So we ordered the motors from another supplier, who gave much 
better service, and we now have some laser cut brackets for fitting.

I think if you wanted to keep using the Bionx, and can't get another 
console, it might be worth trying a different controller, as the Bionx
is the only system which provides regeneration. It is also quite
easy to re-program the console for different wheel sizes, or to
disable the speed governor. I've ordered a couple of consoles via 
my USA distributor, who also claims their service is poor.....

They have some electronics in the motor, some in the battery pack 
and some in the console. So it might be possible to relpace the lot with
a much simpler type of controller.

I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X.  I
installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago for my
wife.  I got what info I could from internet sources to make a decision.  No
one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time.   I was
encouraged that I had made the right decision  when I saw that Wizwheelz
offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but now I
don't see this option on their web site.

Problems are:
The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is disconnected.
Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8 minutes to
reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using the
throttle when running too slow.   Recently, got into mode running at 18mph,
and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.

Like about BionX
1. It is a complete system.  Not too difficult to install on the TT-3.6 --
even though it was never designed for this.
2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster riders.

Do not like about BionX
1. Heavy.   Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy.   Weight bias to
rear.
2. Poor customer service from the factory.  They mostly do not answer e-mail
inquiries.
3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20" wheel the space between rim and
motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire pump.
4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
4. See problems above.

Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering the
distance.  The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the problem
remains.  I think the battery was replaced twice.  A new motor was sent with
26" wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20" rim.

I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time ago. I
believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
customers had problems.  After a while the Bion-X factory became too
difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this message
after I had already purchased one.

I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
problems with BionX.  I seem to be the only one experiencing the system
"lock-up" problem.

I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the drive-train of
the trike without doing a lot of custom work.   I realize that with these
systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub.  Also, most
likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you can with
a hub motor.  Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.

My wife is looking for a power assist velo for negotiating some steep hills
on her commute.  (We have pretty much given up on adding anything to her
GTC.)  Lightfootcycles has some nifty coroplast shells made to fit their
deltas.  For power assist they use Bionix but also a proprietary chain drive
that, because of recent negative comments about Bionix, looks more
interesting.

Has anyone any experience with this?

Interesting that they are using an external controller for the Cyclone motor.

The normal Cyclone controller within the motor limits the amps to 30 amps.

The company who supplied us with the motors, and used the motors on their
own trikes, said that with heavy use, the motor magnets de-magnatized.
I have not had any problems with de-magnatization, but I've only
been using the internal controllers and 24 volts (max 26.5 volts) which
restricts to input to about 800 watts.  

If you want power assistance on your GTC, I would suggest the German
Hienxmann hub motor which can be bought in a number of different 
gear box and and power configerations.

We are now working on a dedicated assited trike, using the Cyclone motor
with automatic transmission.

Heres a letter in response to some I have sent to Lightfootcycles. Some might be interested in his experience with motor assists. Fran

Fran,

??????????????? We at Lightfoot are not using the Cyclone motor any more.? ?We used Cyclones (their entire system) for several years with only a few dysfunctional motors (10%-15%) that we replaced, but 85%of the last batch of Cyclones that we bought failed.? In every case, the internal controller fried.? Many failed within the first few weeks.? We expect the remaining 15% to fail in the near future.? This has been a very costly and damaging ordeal for us, and was no fun for our clients.

?

??????????????? We did not continue with Cyclone motors because previously, when we started having 60-70% percent battery failures with the Lithium Ion battery they provided (every order we received would have a new kind and configuration of battery, with no forewarning of the change, and no explanation of what the new battery was or how to handle it), our contact in the company accused us of abusing the batteries, saying; ?don't act like a kid throw the toy on the ground when you angry. abuse the batteries and say is no good, why this only happen to your batteries?? No=2
0refund!? We were locked into that motor, and though we did not any longer order batteries from them, we did order more motors.? When the last batch started failing catastrophically, however, we fully expected the same reaction and lack of satisfaction from Cyclone, so took the financial hit and started looking for a different solution.

??????????????? 

??????????????? We tried the very inexpensive Golden hub motor and could not ever get our first sample to work, despite a lot of time spent going through the rat?s nest of wiring over and over.

?

??????????????? We used to use the Heinzmann, and had good luck with a majority of the units.? Too many units, however, were problematic.? ?Customer service was so poor at the service center, and troubleshooting so desperately difficult, that we became tired of disassembling and packing up entire systems and sending the whole kit and caboodle out and waiting for weeks and weeks to have it repaired and not being able to get a human on the line when we called to find out why our system (our customer?s system) was still AWOL.? Our Heinzmann experience was a major reason why we have been steadily looking toward a modular system, one without non-serviceable parts, one that we can troubleshoot from a distance in concert with our client, and which can be rep
aired with the insertion of a single module.

?

??????????????? We have been using the BionX, and had good customer service from them when we had problems; problems happened fairly often, but not horribly so.? Our main issue has been that the systems we ordered in December still aren?t here in June.

??????????????? 
??????????????? Though we looked for a hub motor as a simpler-to-install or lower-cost option, we also wanted to stay with a chain drive system for people with heavy duty needs and/or serious hills to deal with.? None of the hub motors can climb like our chain drive units do, though there are big ol? 1000+ watt hub motors out there (Crystalite) that can move a single person on a bike up a hill pretty darn well.



??????????????? Cyclone?s specification is only one version of a nice little motor that can be made in a number of configurations.? The version we are getting is proving to be much more robust.? It has allowed us to stay with the shiftable chain drive system.? It allows us to use a programmable, external controller, which in turn allows us to use almost any kind of battery.? If it turns out in the long term that we have issues with the motor, then, because our system is now modular and programma
ble, we can change out motors with little effort, and with a lot less hassle for our customers, who will now have a system that can be maintained and upgraded for a very long time.? 

?
