<PRE>The UK/EU limit for electric bikes is also 200W, but that's the limit for
bikes that legally count (for almost all purposes) as pedal bikes, and can
be ridden without insurance, without a driving test or licence, etc..
It that the same in Australia?

200W is closer to an elite athlete's average power output than a typical
cyclist, so _if it was used efficiently_ would already be pushing the limits
of being an &quot;assist&quot; rather than an electric powered vehicle.
(Though electric assist bikes can't keep that power output up for anything
like, say, the whole of a Tour de France stage.)

But if a &quot;useful car-replacement&quot; can e.g. carry four people like a typical
car, it's going to need a sizeable motor, not just an assist. Many people
do use cars for journeys that could sensibly be done by bike, and in some
cases an assist might encourage that, but that replaces some fraction of
car journeys rather than really being a replacement for a car.

Getting light electric vehicles on the road legally is much trickier, but
having car-replacements legislated as cars doesn't seem unreasonable.
