is there some law in the usa
against a 4-wheeled thing that looks like a sports car,
but weighs only 100 lb ?
why do you suppose that is?

thank you for pointing out
where I needed to clarify myself;
I meant a dual-use motor-assisted hpv;
it is the motor assistance that causes problems;
there are many laws concerning safety
but they don't apply to motor bikes,
so to skirt the safety laws
a motor-assisted hpv needs to stay like a motorbike
-- not fully enclosed,
and not more than 3 wheels .
. freedom means being able to buy a
fully-enclosed 4-wheeled sports car
that weighs only 100 lb
-- one I can pedal on flat ground in a school zone,
but then run a motor to keep up with 35mph zones .
. trikes interest me only because they
support velomobile designs
<A HREF="http://amerdreamduh.blogspot.com/p/velomobile.html">http://amerdreamduh.blogspot.com/p/velomobile.html</A>
and they can provide high stability
even in high winds .
. just looking at the organictransit models
made feel as if I was going to flip over!
. if people would keep their cars under 100lb,
there wouldn't be any need for licenses or insurance .
