<PRE>Zitat von &quot;Michael Ross&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/trikes">michael.e.ross at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> The 60W panel currently being put on the OT ELF doesn't weight a half a
</I>&gt;<i> kilo.    They are working on sourcing a 120W panel, slight better, and some
</I>&gt;<i> what longer and wider as I understand it.  If that doubles  which is not an
</I>&gt;<i> entirely unreasonable wish for the future, you really have something.
</I>
We had an electric scooter (with 48V 20Ah LiFe pack) Scooter range 40km, battery pack replaced after some month /warranty, 2nd pack dead after 20 months. Costs for battery, shipping, handling etc around Euro 1180 ( Dollar 1550) The scooter did 7600 km, now add the charging costs and one replaced charging unit (90 Euro)  
&gt;<i>From an ecological view charging the vehicle from plug means coal, oil, gas, atomic plants as energy source plus conversion and line losses; would be interesting how much oil has to be burnt for a full charge of the pack..
</I>
&gt;<i> 60W is fine to charge fully during a work day if the sun is bright.  But
</I>&gt;<i> you would need to plug in overnight if commuting.  For my commute the cost
</I>&gt;<i> of plugged power would be $0.10 versus $5 to put gas in my car.  Wear and
</I>&gt;<i> tear comparison is bound to be better as well.  Not bad.
</I>
Yes nice, but it would not drive the trike..
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Incorrect charging will indeed cause problems with Li cells, but it is also
</I>&gt;<i> possible to do it correctly.
</I>
Not with trickle charging Li batteries..
