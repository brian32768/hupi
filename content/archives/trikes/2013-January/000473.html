<PRE>Zitat von &quot;Michael Ross&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/trikes">michael.e.ross at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> You like to make provocative statements.  I must ask you to defend them a
</I>&gt;<i> bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;From an ecological view charging the vehicle from plug means coal, oil,
</I>&gt;<i> gas, atomic plants as energy source plus conversion and line losses; would
</I>&gt;<i> be interesting how much oil has to be burnt for a full charge of the pack.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that the $0.10 or so I have to pay for a kilowatt hour really is
</I>&gt;<i> the cost of the power - plus some profit.  The local utilities are not in
</I>&gt;<i> the habit of giving their product away for free.
</I>
They dont, but you and I do - paying taxes. Each and any state is sponsoring his energy sources, not only for solar, wind but there were going billions of taxpayers money into atomic plants, coal and oil..

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&gt; 60W is fine to charge fully during a work day if the sun is bright.  But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you would need to plug in overnight if commuting.  For my commute the cost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of plugged power would be $0.10 versus $5 to put gas in my car.  Wear and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tear comparison is bound to be better as well.  Not bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes nice, but it would not drive the trike..&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't understand your comment.   The battery pack holds 480Watt
</I>&gt;<i> hours so a kWh ought to charge it
</I>  Its called solar-electric and this is, ahem, misleading because it runs from plug and not from solar on the trike..

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I am not following your thought process here.  I am not sure how you
</I>&gt;<i> mean trickle charging.
</I>see:

-----------------------snip
It is important to note that trickle charging is not acceptable for lithium batteries. The Li-ion chemistry cannot accept an overcharge without causing damage to the cell, possibly plating out lithium metal and becoming hazardous.

&gt;<i> There is a charge controller used to properly manage battery charging.
</I>&gt;<i>  Perhaps this is different from whatever you mean by trickle charging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is pretty clear that Li batteries can be charged so that there are no
</I>&gt;<i> problems. Why do you think it is not possible for this system to do
</I>&gt;<i> likewise?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or are you just saying that the OT people must be lying?  You should have
</I>&gt;<i> some valid basis for that other than opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you privy to the specifications of systems implemented on this machine?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you aware of some technological reason why they cannot be charged
</I>&gt;<i> correctly from a solar cell, whether it be 60W, 120W, or 240W?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MIke
