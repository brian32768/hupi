<PRE>The new laws in Oz will affect some bike shops, and the people
importing from Europe will love them. But the people importing from
China/Asia don't care because they don't follow them. It's easy to buy
a &quot;bicycle&quot; here that has a 400W motor, throttle and decorative
pedals. For under $1000. Spend a bit more and you often get something
with less power (and smaller but still entirely imaginary chance of
being prosecuted).

The real issue is the IC powered ones, with poorly made two stroke
engines bolted to poorly made bicycles. People ride them on the
off-road shared paths with no regard for basically anything. The
problem is getting worse because, again, they're being brought in and
sold cheaply as bicycles.

Michael Ross said:
&gt;<i> Yeah, I remember how the helmet laws cut bike ridership in OZ by 80% or so.
</I>
50%, ish. Death rate went up to compensate though, so we have fewer
deaths but the remaining cyclists have a greater chance of dying.
Numbers today are greater than before helmets, just because cycling
numbers are growing pretty darn fast.

&gt;<i> Do they actually enforce stuff there?
</I>
Some things, yes. Helmet laws, for example. Power assist laws they
don't even try because it requires training to be able to tell (and
even then it really requires a lab test). With the electric ones I can
sympathise, most of them are &quot;one less car&quot; and many motors are &quot;X
watts at Y volts&quot; so who really knows anyway.



One useful thing with the rule change is that it makes power assisted
velomobiles much safer. Having more power but cutting out at 25kph
means that stuff like the Trisled Avatar will be less able to reach
the 80kph or so on the flat that a fit rider with 200W power assist
should be able to manage. Of course, they're now more likely to be
pulled over to check :)

One of <A HREF="http://hupi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/trikes">Ben at Trisled</A>'s concerns is that a US-legal 500W motor could
easily push his velomobiles to speeds they're not really designed to
crash at. He's more about &quot;200W gets you 50kph&quot; because that's what a
reasonably fit cyclist should be able to put out unassisted.

Luckily the linked vehicles are built for the other end of the speed
spectrum :)
