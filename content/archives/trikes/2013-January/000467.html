Over 200W and it has to be registered. Impossible with any sort of 
bicycle-based device, and even with the right gear it's a 
legal/engineering minefield. On the plus side, there are well-defined 
pathways for getting EV conversions registered, so the law is being 
sensibly administered there.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> like, say, the whole of a Tour de France stage.)

</I>&gt;<i> But if a &quot;useful car-replacement&quot; can e.g. carry four people like a typical
</I>&gt;<i> car, it's going to need a sizeable motor, not just an assist. Many people
</I>&gt;<i> do use cars for journeys that could sensibly be done by bike, and in some
</I>&gt;<i> cases an assist might encourage that, but that replaces some fraction of
</I>&gt;<i> car journeys rather than really being a replacement for a car.
</I>
By &quot;useful car replacement&quot; I meant something that could carry you and 
some shopping without compromising handling and braking. Weather 
protection (e.g. a velo) would be a definite plus.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting light electric vehicles on the road legally is much trickier, but
</I>&gt;<i> having car-replacements legislated as cars doesn't seem unreasonable.
