</I>&gt;<i> They dont, but you and I do - paying taxes. Each and any state is
</I>&gt;<i> sponsoring his energy sources, not only for solar, wind but there were
</I>&gt;<i> going billions of taxpayers money into atomic plants, coal and oil..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure I know all that.  And a gallon of gas really costs $15 .  No argument
</I>there.

I was talking about my own cost.  I will get payback in pretty decent time
if the thing functions as planned.  it will cost me about $0.10 to charge
it once by wall current and if I park it on a sunny day while I work it
will charge just fine for free.  Compare that to my gas cost to drive my
car of about $5 at today's prices give or take a bit.


  Its called solar-electric and this is, ahem, misleading because it runs
&gt;<i> from plug and not from solar on the trike..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Please don't get snotty, there is no reason for that.  You read something
into this that I never said.
But, it IS solar and electric, if you plug in some times, and you leave it
in the sun other times, it will charge either way.

It is has a 60W cell right now.  And it is set up to be plugged in as the
main source of power.  If you park it for 7 hours they on a roughly
1000W/m^2 day you will get a full charge (we get 1300W/m^2 but it probably
averages out lower depending on what you define as a day for averaging).

60W cell, that clearly will not work as the sole source if you ride beyond
30miles plus whatever is offset by pedaling.   OT thinks that 240 watts
from a mounted solar cell is possible in the future.  At that rate you
would only need wall power it it is overcast.  That seems like a reasonable
statement to me.  There is already room for a 120W panel on it.


&gt;<i> &gt; Again, I am not following your thought process here.  I am not sure how
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mean trickle charging.
</I>&gt;<i> see:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.powerstream.com/li.htm">http://www.powerstream.com/li.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries">http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
By your definition then, the OT ELF is not trickle charged.  It is a
controlled charge.  There should be no problems letting the sun charge
it because the process is manged to keep the batteries healthy.

If I ever said it was trickle charged (I do not believe I did), then I
misspoke.


&gt;<i> -----------------------snip
</I>&gt;<i> It is important to note that trickle charging is not acceptable for
</I>&gt;<i> lithium batteries. The Li-ion chemistry cannot accept an overcharge without
</I>&gt;<i> causing damage to the cell, possibly plating out lithium metal and becoming
</I>&gt;<i> hazardous.
</I>&gt;<i> snip---------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I absolutely agree.  I never said otherwise.
</I>

&gt;<i> &gt; There is a charge controller used to properly manage battery charging.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Perhaps this is different from whatever you mean by trickle charging.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is pretty clear that Li batteries can be charged so that there are no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems. Why do you think it is not possible for this system to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likewise?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or are you just saying that the OT people must be lying?  You should have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some valid basis for that other than opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you privy to the specifications of systems implemented on this
</I>&gt;<i> machine?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you aware of some technological reason why they cannot be charged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correctly from a solar cell, whether it be 60W, 120W, or 240W?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, nothing to say here, I guess.

Again:

&gt;<i>  &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
