<PRE>You like to make provocative statements.  I must ask you to defend them a
bit.

&quot;From an ecological view charging the vehicle from plug means coal, oil,
gas, atomic plants as energy source plus conversion and line losses; would
be interesting how much oil has to be burnt for a full charge of the pack.&quot;

I suspect that the $0.10 or so I have to pay for a kilowatt hour really is
the cost of the power - plus some profit.  The local utilities are not in
the habit of giving their product away for free.

&quot;&gt; 60W is fine to charge fully during a work day if the sun is bright.  But
&gt;<i> you would need to plug in overnight if commuting.  For my commute the cost
</I>&gt;<i> of plugged power would be $0.10 versus $5 to put gas in my car.  Wear and
</I>&gt;<i> tear comparison is bound to be better as well.  Not bad.
</I>
Yes nice, but it would not drive the trike..&quot;

I really don't understand your comment.   The battery pack holds 480Watt
hours so a kWh ought to charge it

That provides 30 miles of assistance (I am not sure how that is portioned
out pedal work vs battery work).  I believe this is already proven.  They
have been built and tested.  So on what basis do you challenge this?

&quot;&gt; Incorrect charging will indeed cause problems with Li cells, but it is
also
&gt;<i> possible to do it correctly.
</I>
Not with trickle charging Li batteries.&quot;

Again, I am not following your thought process here.  I am not sure how you
mean trickle charging.

There is a charge controller used to properly manage battery charging.
 Perhaps this is different from whatever you mean by trickle charging.

It is pretty clear that Li batteries can be charged so that there are no
problems. Why do you think it is not possible for this system to do
likewise?

Or are you just saying that the OT people must be lying?  You should have
some valid basis for that other than opinion.

Are you privy to the specifications of systems implemented on this machine?

Are you aware of some technological reason why they cannot be charged
correctly from a solar cell, whether it be 60W, 120W, or 240W?

Regards,

MIke
