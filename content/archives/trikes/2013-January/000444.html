<PRE>I wonder how parking in motorcycle parking spots, would go over with motorcyclists/bylaw officers. &#160;It would be too difficult to get into bicycle cages, like I use at work.

Hi all,

Long time, not write.

I hope SWMBO will go along with this and let me buy one and be a beta
tester for them - an ELF from Organic Transit, made nearby in Durham NC:

There isn't anything really new about it, but they have combined what is
out there nicely.

I think I can really make good use of one.&#160; My commute is 23.5 miles each
way.&#160; More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much time.

This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if that
is at full, electric only, speed.&#160; But, it should be fine with a lets and
battery power.&#160;  It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall current
in two hours.&#160; So I can easily get to work and back.&#160; It will go a lot
faster than 20mph with leg power.&#160; I might maintain 25mph or more for the
trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter trike.
It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.&#160; I don't know if it is geared
for higher.

Happy nNew Year,

Mike
