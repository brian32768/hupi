<PRE>Hi all,

Long time, not write.

I hope SWMBO will go along with this and let me buy one and be a beta
tester for them - an ELF from Organic Transit, made nearby in Durham NC:

There isn't anything really new about it, but they have combined what is
out there nicely.

I think I can really make good use of one.  My commute is 23.5 miles each
way.  More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much time.

This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if that
is at full, electric only, speed.  But, it should be fine with a lets and
battery power.   It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall current
in two hours.  So I can easily get to work and back.  It will go a lot
faster than 20mph with leg power.  I might maintain 25mph or more for the
trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter trike.
 It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.  I don't know if it is geared
for higher.

Happy nNew Year,

Mike
