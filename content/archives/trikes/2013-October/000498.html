<PRE>Never one to take the &quot;easy&quot; way out, I went to my local Chinese Tool Store (aka Harbor Freight Tools) and bought one of their 440# capacity electric lifts.  At the time I had a Leitra and I built a flat platform out of plywood with chains and eyescrews attached so I could roll the trike onto the platform, attach 4 rings to the hook, and proceed to elevate the trike overhead.  I forst did this in the Automotive Shop of the high school where I taught.  Later I did this in my garage at home where I was able to raise the trike above my wife's minivan in between roof trusses 24&quot; on center.

After selling the Leitra, I kept the lift (not the platform) and have stored my unfaired Taiwanese trike overhead using bungee-like cords with hooks attached to all 3 wheels.

We have since moved and I have taken the lift with me but have yet to install it -- too many other demands with the new house.
