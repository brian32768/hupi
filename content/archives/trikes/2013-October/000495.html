<PRE>I used to use a row of standard folding wall-mounted bike racks in my garage. These folded when not in use, when down they had a padded &#8216;U&#8217; projecting into the garage space at maybe a 20&#8221; spacing. The crossmember of the trike sat on the arms nose towards the ceiling with all three wheels resting against the wall.

Cheers,

&gt;<i>    I have one of the original review Wiz Wheelz-Terra Trike 3.6 tadpole trikes.  I wanted to hang it to free up floor space. Rather than hang from the rear wheel with all the weight of the built up trike on the rear rim, I put up two hangers and hung the trike by the front wheels.  With a Zipper &quot;Chopper&quot; fairing on their three point mount and all the accessories on the trike and rear rack, it puts a lot less stress on the rims to hang from two rims rather than one.  Fortunately the tires on my trike are right at 32 inches center to center and with the wall studs 16 inches on center (16 inches center to center) I was able to anchor the Terra Trike wall mounts into studs on both sides.  With an eight foot wall in the garage, the six foot long trike with accessories hangs just fine.  I roll the trike back to the wall with front facing away.  Lift to vertical, turn to face the wall, place wheels close to the wall, slide to the left and lower to hang.   To remove I lift slightly, slide
</I>&gt;<i> to the right, turn half way around and set the trike down facing away from the wall.  No need to remove anything and ready to ride at any time.
