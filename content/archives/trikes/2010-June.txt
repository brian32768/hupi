Although my TerraTrike 3.4 has served me well for seven years, I have the
7-year itch.  There are a few features or options I would like to have that
weren't available when I snagged the TT.

In no particular order, here are some features lacking from the TT.  (I have
already added some to my TT, but would like them straight out of the new
trike box.)  Please add to this list your own pet gripes.  By the time this
thread dies I hope something will take shape that is commercially available.

1.  Fixed seat: Mine is set at about the same standard angle as my wife's
GTC and never gets reset.  And it creaks and wobbles from old age - the
trike, that is.

2.  Sturdy idlers:  Those original equipment delrins lasted about 2 weeks.
Got the TerraCycle versions and no problems since.

3.  Easy to remove front wheels:  The TT takes a 24mm wrench.  I much prefer
the GTC simple hex removal.

4.  Built-in mounting options: I like the GS post system, for example.

5.  Easier-to-mount fenders if a rack is also present.  TT owners know what
I am talking about - at least if you have an earlier model.

6.  Wider gear range - or at least more granny gears:  The 17-92 gear-inch
range barely cuts it at times.  I don't race, but I spin out at around
27-28mph going downhill.  At the low end, some of the hills around here are
real killers.  The GTC has a 3x hub that is pretty nice, but I'm not going
to sink that much cash into the TT at this point.  Give it to me as an
option on a new trike and I won't squeal so much.

7.  Less twitchy steering.  When I hit 35mph it gets squirrely; at 40 it is
terrifying.  And that is after aligning the wheels - a real pain, by the
way.  I never really have confidence that I have done a good job.

8.  Less brake steer: the hills again.  At high speeds, the brakes require
extraordinary skill to avoid swerving all over the road when slowing.  (I
know, I know.  I shouldn't be going that fast.  But let those among you
without sin cast the first stone.)

Anyway, I would like to hear about your dissatisfactions or trikes you have
used that take care of some of these problems.  Or maybe you have the
perfect trike already?

Thanks,
Larry

Well, my homebuilt had nice steady steering and no brake steer.  The 
handgrip travel was about 4X greater than is common on trikes for the 
same amount of turning.  I used long levers, and a large turning 
circle.  I made U-turns and T-turns the same as I would in a car.  Both 
front brakes worked from the same handgrip, and the steering had 1/2" 
positive scrub radius with a bit of toe-in.

BTW, I used to get a dozen messages a day from lists like this.  Has 
everybody moved to Facebook?

Hey,
      Sounds to me like you need an ICE "T" :-)

I have a Trice Explorer .... earlier relative of the "T".

First of all  ICE give you a customer service second to none.

Second, they ain't cheap but how often are you going to buy a trike
... I have had mine for 10 years now and I don't expect to get another.  Mind 
you, David Whitman's Velomobile makes me drool.

The steering on the Explorer is great .. I have descended Hecker Pass (towards 
Gilroy .. nice surface, sweeping bends)  at over 50 mph with no problems.

The Explorer has no brake steer and will pull up straight with only one front 
brake.

My Explorer has the SRAM Dual Drive which ICE does not supply any more. 
I have a 12-36 rear cassette and a 44-34-22 front triple on a 155mm crank 
which gives me a range of 22*20/36 at the bottom and 44*20/12 for the top ... 
about 12"-74".  Being an Old Fart I find the top is sufficient .. if I am going 
that fast I dont pedal :-) and the bottom gets me up most hills.  With the 
dual drive the range goes from 9-100. I have the bar-end type gear changers( 
wouldn't change these for the worlds) and Hope hydraulic disc brakes ... if I 
do an emergency stop (like I just noticed the traffic lights are red) I can bury 
the front chainring in the asphalt.

I am sure you can get a dual drive rear wheel but you may have to get it made 
specially.  The "T" folds and you can get various quick release goodies which 
make folding a snap but of course with the SRAM drive you cannot QR the rear 
wheel.

You can get a fancy rack with the "T" and all-round fenders.  The seat angle 
is adjustable !! 

In the 10 years I have had my trike (16000 miles), I have changed out the rear 
cluster twice because of wear, the crankset once to change to 155mm from 170mm 
(spin, spin), the chain (all 2.5 standard chains ) twice (wear and new drive 
train), the front chainrings once (wear), the front and rear idlers once and 
the trackrod ends once (at 4k miles ... they were worn out .. the new ones 
have no perceptable wear after a further 12K miles) .. oh and three sets of 
tires.  All told I have spent about $1000 in 10 years .. $100 a year ain't 
bad.

cheers

I believe in keep it simple. I fillet braze with fixed seat angle brazed 
as part of the frame, steering levers directly out of steer tubes, 
single adjustable track rod, stub axles with either disc brakes or drum 
brakes. 4th last one is the newest that made it to my webpage yet...

http://trikes4all.com/recent/purple/

That has simple 24 speed der system... 28/38/48 front on 152 cranks, 
rear 13-34  on 406 wheels all around.

Everyone that rides on of mine always seem to love the steering....

I never thought I would ever want to quit my current ride: the last Trice custom Explorer that ICE ever built.  Before that, they had built a custom XL for me.  I only left that one because I needed a relatively lower bottom bracket. When the first "off the shelf" models appeared, I wasn't impressed.  

Fast forward to today, and I think these new full suspension Adventures and Sprints are as well-designed and built as any of their customs - which is saying something.  I've had both TerraTrikes (3.3) and Greenspeeds (GTO) and they're fine machines but you might want to look at these new ICE offerings. They have an awful lot going for them and they're better and 'way cheaper than what I had to pay for my customs.  I, too, am getting the itch.

Regards, Phil

I don't have a gripe list as such, but comments below, based on my 
current ride and others less fortunate :-)

Would sometimes like an adjustable seat. Must build that on-the-fly 
adjustable linkage one day...

Greenspeed make good ones. Lacking a lathe, I have always bought theirs. 
They are silent and last for ever.

At least you can easily retrofit more gearing - it's only money :-)

Have you checked its geometry out in Peter Eland's steering spreadsheet? 
What might be happening is that the toe-out increases as you get away 
from straight-ahead. Also the next item may influence.

There's no excuse for brake and bump steer - the kingpins should, when 
projected, hit the ground almost directly in front of the contact patch 
with a trail of about 1.5-2". If you get that right, the trike will be 
stable at any speed and not give you any brown stains to the trousers. 
At over 70mph my present ride is quite uneventful to steer (wouldn't 
mind suspension at that speed tho..) Greenspeed geometry is for me the 
benchmark here (usual disclaimer applies)

Conversely, I've ridden some that had vertical kingpins. Scary... The 
Windcheetah is like that, and is only saved by having linked brakes, 
which must be kept carefully adjusted to avoid pulling to one side.
(My asbestos suit is close at hand for the inevitable WC backlash...)

Best,
G.

My name is Elmo Butler and I am in Natchez, Mississippi. I will turn 64 this
year and have rode bikes for a lot of years.

I have never ridden a trike since childhood and think now is the time for a
serious trike.

I am starting my second attempt to build a trike. Back in 1998 I ordered a
set of plans from Greenspeed.

Started the build, acquired wheels and tires. SA drum brakes on the front
with a caliper on the rear for 

parking and drag on hills. 

            I then got into building an TourEasy from a pile of 4130 and
Henry James lugs. A lot of things happened

and the trike just sat there. Now I am looking at the frame and it is not
suitable. So I am going to build a new 

frame from 4130 chromo. I have a friend who is a good machinest and he is
giong to build my spindles and axels for me.

            Any suggestions are welcome.

            Elmo

Subject: [trikes] Front Derailleur Needed
Message-ID: <4C223776.403@zalonoffice.com>

*The front d?railleur (FD) of my GTO just blew up, and I was shocked, 
shocked to learn that this model FD is no longer being manufactured. The 
only ones that the distributors carry have a longer profile (on the 
inside, to keep the chain in line), but they don't work well with 
44-tooth middle chain rings. My local wrench says that my options are to 
switch out my current 44-tooth CR for a 39, which will work just fine 
with the new d?railleurs; or go on eBay, where the old-style FDs may 
still be available.

Before I do that, does anyone know where I can find a new (or almost 
new) FD that would work on my GTO? The parts numbers would be:

105: FD 5503
Tiagra: FD 4403

Thanks,

Jules

Hi Elmo,

It sounds like you have a good start, with a set of Greenspeed plans, wheels, brakes and some building experience.  Why do you think it's "not suitable"?

Thunderbolt plans are still available, for free or Spitfire, can be bought, but I find I spend almost as much time creating my own plans, as I do building.

Other than for shipping/demounting, I'm unclear why it matters how the front wheels remove.  When changing tires or repairing a flat, I just put the trike onto it's side and have the wheel at a nice working level.

Subject: [trikes] New trike?

Although my TerraTrike 3.4 has served me well for seven years, I have the
7-year itch.  There are a few features or options I would like to have that
weren't available when I snagged the TT.

In no particular order, here are some features lacking from the TT.  (I have
already added some to my TT, but would like them straight out of the new
trike box.)  Please add to this list your own pet gripes.  By the time this
thread dies I hope something will take shape that is commercially available.

1.  Fixed seat: Mine is set at about the same standard angle as my wife's
GTC and never gets reset.  And it creaks and wobbles from old age - the
trike, that is.

2.  Sturdy idlers:  Those original equipment delrins lasted about 2 weeks.
Got the TerraCycle versions and no problems since.

3.  Easy to remove front wheels:  The TT takes a 24mm wrench.  I much prefer
the GTC simple hex removal.

4.  Built-in mounting options: I like the GS post system, for example.

5.  Easier-to-mount fenders if a rack is also present.  TT owners know what
I am talking about - at least if you have an earlier model.

6.  Wider gear range - or at least more granny gears:  The 17-92 gear-inch
range barely cuts it at times.  I don't race, but I spin out at around
27-28mph going downhill.  At the low end, some of the hills around here are
real killers.  The GTC has a 3x hub that is pretty nice, but I'm not going
to sink that much cash into the TT at this point.  Give it to me as an
option on a new trike and I won't squeal so much.

7.  Less twitchy steering.  When I hit 35mph it gets squirrely; at 40 it is
terrifying.  And that is after aligning the wheels - a real pain, by the
way.  I never really have confidence that I have done a good job.

8.  Less brake steer: the hills again.  At high speeds, the brakes require
extraordinary skill to avoid swerving all over the road when slowing.  (I
know, I know.  I shouldn't be going that fast.  But let those among you
without sin cast the first stone.)

Anyway, I would like to hear about your dissatisfactions or trikes you have
used that take care of some of these problems.  Or maybe you have the
perfect trike already?

Thanks,
Larry

Well now, I'll join in. I'm a Greenspeed guy, but I have to admit I've never ridden any other trike. My first GS was a GT-5 - a folder with a 40-degree seat back. I liked it a lot; no complaints, even riding in the Berkeley hills and East Bay streets.

Then I upgraded to an X-5 folder, with a 30-degree seat back, which I now prefer - better aerodynamics. On a trike, i don't mind a high bottom bracket. relative to seat height. On both trikes, I found the Gator hydraulic brakes excellent - zero maintenance in 5 years. Downhill at 50 mph once, on a city street, was terrifying. My normally effortless steering, at that speed, swerved widely with the slightest touch. Brake steer, on my GS, does happen, of course, when using unequal force to one side or the other - but it is not difficult to steer dead ahead while braking equally with both sides. I've never really desired suspension, either. The trikes jolts with every unevenness in the pavement, but the sling mesh seat effectively isolates my body from the vibrations.

I recently installed a Rohloff 14-speed rear hub, with new double Q-rings up front - 53t and 39t, I believe. That set-up seems to work well, although the manners of the new transmission take some getting-used-to. If I had unlimited money to spend and space in my workshop/garage, I'd try a Catrike Speed, and maybe an ICE Q.

Happy riding to all!

I have also been wondering if I was ejected from the list.  Almost no posts
for a few months.  I was heavily involved with the list while choosing my
TT3.4 and have been mostly lurking ever since.

Interesting stuff.  It seems like gearing, steering and braking are the
common interests - the last two of occasionally life-saving importance.  One
responder (who chose to remain anonymous) told me about becoming airborne at
high speed and heading toward a truck.  He is a big fan of brake steer which
saved him after landing.  I just want to more easily negotiate downhill
curves and slow down when I am going too fast without swerving into oncoming
traffic.

I seem to remember Trice marketing the Ts, but their website doesn't refer
to them at all.  Just Adventure, Sprint and Vortex.  All of them are
folding.  Does that mean that these are all progeny of the Ts?  They are
certainly cheaper than I remember.  What happened to the old rigid frame
models?  Too expensive to sell?  There must have been some compromises made
to bring the price down so much.  Any ideas?

I know that GS has great engineering.  My wife's GS-GTC is certainly a
beauty at roughly twice the price of my TT3.4.   GS also has some relatively
inexpensive folders, but still stocks rigid frame trikes.  I really don't
need the folding feature - especially if there are compromises that result.

Perhaps have a look at the trike plans on atomiczombie.com  . Couple of 
nice ones there. A bit heavy but using CroMo would get the weight 
down.I've built a few and they rode well. Delta wolf, Stret fox and 
Warrior were the ones. They now offer a tandem that Iintend to build.

Hey,
       Adventure == T
       Sprint == Q
       Vortex == micro
These are my thoughts looking at the pictures/frames.
When in doubt, call ICE ... they  are always very helpful

Get your machinist buddy to make you a dedicated tube bender.  CrMo
doesn't bend willingly.  (hell we pay extra for just that trait), and
I have broken light duty commercial benders trying.  You will need the
bender for the seat frame bits, and the handlebars.  On my bikes, it
was all 3/4" od, and a common radius (this is pre ergo seat), so I
turned up a grooved disk from aluminum.

I used the lathe to get the bend diameter, and a V groove to deal with
most of the material, followed by a rotary table, and a ball endmill
to get a real half circle groove.  I already had a center hole, and
an additional pair of holes on a radial line (its how I mounted it to
the rotary table).  The center hole mounted the bending shoe, the
other two holes, a steel strap to hold the tubing down, and which also
served as a lug to hold the thing in my bench vise.  (my shop has yet
to emerge from my last move, so I can't provide a picture)

Looking at an example current 105 front mech here: http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=13623
Is it that big looping backplate hitting your 44 causing the problem?

The Tiagra you mention is listed as available on that site: http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=8284

As they're based in Ireland I'm sure they can manage to ship to the US...

are you aware of this attempt to sell to the triking community.  i think some monitoring is in order regarding selling on the message board.

Subject: [trikes] Front suspension
Message-ID: <AANLkTil-XXCnefWjcYTl9vMV23kyHk99HDYqcwVX1L1h@mail.gmail.com>

I was looking at the suspension options on the ICE machines.  With a mesh
seat I don't see much use for rear suspension unless you routinely deal with
cobblestones.  However, the front suspension seems like it might be of some
use during terrifying downhill trips at high speed in a tadpole.  I am
thinking of bumps, holes & debris that could catastrophically mess with
steering.  Any experience with this?

Still searching for the perfect trike.

If the steering geometry is correct, bumps and holes don't mess with
steering, even in a trike without suspension.  

Three-wheel suspension on a trike has the potential to:

- Massively improve comfort
- Provide better cornering grip over bumpy surfaces
- And, my experience, provide better cornering grip over wet surfaces

Because when the rear wheel of a trike passes over a bump the rear of the
trike moves vertically, and because when a front wheel of a trike moves over
a bump the trike moves in a combination of pitch and roll, rear bumps are
felt more harshly.


Regards,

Julian Edgar

 Hi Bill

I was one of those who commented on Bionx a while back.  I have the 350W
unit on a TT3.6 for my wife -- we have had it about 2 years now..  Sent it
back to the dealer many times. Many components have been replaced. The
problems was that it would lock-out under load and take 5 to 10 minutes to
recover.  Part of the problem no doubt was that my wife would forget to
gear-down on hills -- we do have hills in the Piedmont section of NC.
Anyway, it is much better now, due to my wife learning what can cause an
overload and likely some updated components.
She is  satisfied now, and would not want to be without it.  It does add a
lot of weight to the trike.
All of my communication was with the dealer.  I have sent e-mails to Bionx
in the past and they went into their trash folder -- I guess.
The dealer is in Salt Lake City (I am in NC) -- they had the best price at
the time.  The dealer really did try to help though they seemed to be slow
to respond at times.  Recommend you use a local dealer if possible.

Thanks for the comments, all. The two FDs are still available on eBay . 
. . and for a very nice price. I just bought a new 105 FD for $16.00 
plus shipping. But eventually, they will all be sold out. And then the 
best fix would be to change out the 44 tooth CR for a standard 39, which 
the new FDs are made to handle.

Tadpole trikes ride pretty well on bad surface, provided steering geometry is ok. You will have the least problem with the front wheels. I have even had one wheel disconnect from the steering rod at a descend at 40 km/h with no catastrophe. 

If you are going to put suspension on a tadpole trike from comfort point of view, start to look at the rear wheel.

IME a trike without suspension (ICE Q-NT) works just fine even on rough
descents. If you worry about staying in the road the rear wheel might be
your primary concern and will potentially benefit more from the closer
contact to the track provided by suspension: On a tadpole a front wheel
loosing contact does next to nothing while a sliding rear wheel results
in immediate spin. Try some power slides on loose surface. It is much
fun on frozen lakes.
