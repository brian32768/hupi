No replies this time, that is odd.

I have a couple hundred miles on the ELF now.   I can do my commute and it
isn't bad at all.  I can average about 21.5mph for the 24 mile trip.  This
is with my husbanding resources, both mine and the batteries.  I get 14
miles from one allegedly 9Ah battery.  I believe with more fitness I will
be able to average 23mph. Part of it will be learning how to use the
batteries best.  I have some power to spare, but I am making sure I don't
run out.  It is much too heavy for unassisted pedaling on inclines.

I really do want some shorter cranks, I just can't spin 175mm ones as well
as I like.

I like it, I can get where I need to go quickly enough, it takes off at
lights and crest hills so much better than I can do on a non-assisted
xxcycle.  The exercise is at a really good level.  I can maintain a good
level of work and I don't blow up on hills.  I am more liable to over
extend on slight downhills where I turn the transmission all the way up and
work as hard as I can for the cadence.  But, I can rest and use the motor,
then work some more.

I am pretty happy with it.  It does what they say. If you are hearty you
can do more.

There are some fragility issues with bodywork, but any HPV has to work at
the edge of durability to keep weight down.

Mike

I have ridden at night, and the wind screen was to reflective of the
interior and ground and I have a hard time seeing the road.  But I made a
dash board that does the trick.  I have already started depending on it for
towels, a hat, a flashlight, and a water bottle.

Hi Mike

What is the ELF like in rain? Are you keeping dry enough with the open
design of the body?

Does the front screen keep clear enough to see or do you need some sort of
wiper?

Thanks

Derryl

Hi - I am getting a second battery to help me up and over the hills - what is the steepest grade you've done in the ELF?

Thanks!

Hi Sharon,

I don't have any way to answer that with accuracy.  Here, in Raleigh and
eastward to where I live are hills, that in my current state of fitness I
would not go up them more than 5 mph.  I seem to be able to go 17 or 18 mph
over the steepest ones I have seen in my limited travels.  I don't consider
these hills to be worthy of referencing with a percent grade designation;
however, it is not what I would call flat here either.  Geologically it is
the eastern piedmont, and it truly flat eastward from where I live.   IMO
we do not have very steep hills here.  What hills I have on my commute I
can top them at 20 mph or more.

I want to get longer battery milage so I do work at a sustainable hard
pace.  I am also overweight at 6 feet tall and 255 lb (and dropping), and
carry a fair amount of gear 20 lb? And 27 lb of batteries.

You can't tell how your own use will compare given all the variables that
are likely different.

Tell me where you live, how far you want to go, how fast, and how much you
and your gear weigh, and probably most important, your level of fitness,
past cycling experience, and willingness to work hard on your ride.  Then,
I might be able to hypothesize about what you can do.

It appears that we can get larger batteries online for considerably less
that the ones the ELF was built for - batteries that fit into the battery
tray or storage box in the back.  The suppliers are all Chinese (including
those that OT is using).  There is some risk in buying from these folks.
Their webpages are often poorly translated, not very clear, and with
some conflicting information.  For instance, the battery I have ordered is
listed as 9kg in one place and 12kg in another.

I think since my current 10 and 9 Amp hour batteries are 6 kg, that a 12 kg
battery  is more likely to be the quoted 20 Amp hours rather than the 9 kg
one.  I don't have a clear idea how any of these batteries are measured, if
at all.  I am prepared to find out I really have a 15 AMp hour battery
coming, it is still less expensive.

I have heard that beta testers who do not  contribute much, or no work at
all to the ELF can get about 6 miles between charges from a 9 AMp hour
battery.  I have gotten 18 miles at an average speed of 18 to 20 mph.  If I
go faster I sacrifice distance per charge.  If I go 23 mph on average, I
get maybe 12 miles.   I am working as hard as I am able.  On a regular
bicycle I might  be able to average 11 or 12 mph on these routes.

I think this is a very practical range of mileage and speed, but you must
not over do what you have battery power to cover or you will be stuck.
 Take you cell phone, and know someone with a truck, or be conservative.

I get more from the 10 Amp hour battery I have which is apparently
significantly more expensive for the function it provides than the 9 Amp
hour ones.

We should all be sharing notes on battery prices and suppliers, as this is
the main contributor to the utility of the ELF.  On any kind of incline it
is much too heavy for unassisted pedalling.

I don't know if we should keep using the trikes list, as some people don't
like to here about electric assist.  On the other hand, there is no other
conversation here, so I am not sure why anyone would care.  There are
probably better lists and forums to join.

 Started this thread in this list because there are people here whose
opinions I really respect and trust.

Mike
