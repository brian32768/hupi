Sorry, I talked about this with Alex off-list and I should have
written everyone especially so the list admins would know details.

I have tried out GoogleGroups with other projects and don't like it. I
prefer to continue with mailman.

I intend to ramp up some projects at HuPI.org over the next months. I
am planning on moving the hpv lists to hupi.org.

I am in the process of setting up a new server for HuPI.org that can
handle more traffic. It will probably be at tektonic.net which worked
well for ihpva.org/whpva.org before I backed out of that fray.

Other than the domain name changing AGAIN... (what is this the 4th
time?) sticking with mailman should make the move relatively painless.
Archives are always a problem but they can continue to live at
bikelist.org at least for now.

Thanks Moz and Bob for offering hosting space. Thanks also to the list
admins for their continued support.

Brian

Greetings --

This mailing list "trikes at bikelist.org" is moving to "trikes at hupi.org".

The move will probably commence on Monday or Tuesday, depending on how
busy we are. When Alex (at bikelist.org) is ready, he will turn off
the list at bikelist.org so no new messages will be accepted there
(this includes commands such as subscribe/unsubscribe requests). Alex
will then send the list data to me and I will install it and
reactivate the list at hupi.org.

We're using the same software at both servers so in theory this should
be a simple move.

You don't have to do anything -- except start using the new address
after the move.
I will send another message when the list is running at hupi.org.

Sorry, but if you're on more than one 'hpv' list you will be reading
this message more than once!
