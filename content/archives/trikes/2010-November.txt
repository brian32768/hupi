Subject: [trikes] steering design question (and dreadful wheelchair
	design)
Message-ID: <7on687jla0lg24840nri0uan.1288721109648@email.android.com>

Thanks for all the replies, I've been studying the load-carrying trikes, and there does seem to be a range of different steering set-ups. I guess each has its pros and cons.

I'm aware of the various hand-cranked options, sadly that's not an option for my wife, her ME means anything but very gentle exercise is out, Iran rightly points out the downside of what is basically a rickshaw, but if it's a choice of not getting out in the fresh air, or getting out with me providing the motive power I know which one we'd choose.

As for wheelchair design, it strikes me all but the very best is at least 20 years behind bike design, and I'd love to see something very different, very modern and very efficient, perhaps someone here's up to the challenge?

Subject: [trikes] Greenspeed tandem vanishes under steam train
Message-ID: <20101125145010.GA13083@embryo.tricolour.net>


This may not be quite what you are expecting from the subject line.  :D

Most of you are probably already familiar with the antics we do up here
in Ottawa enabled by the creations of a certain list member from Ferntree
Gully...

Last Saturday HPVOoO (Human Powered Vehicle Operators of Ottawa)
participated yet again in the annual Ottawa Firefighters Help Santa Toy
Parade.  This time we had the ambitious idea of turning my Greenspeed
GTVs6 tandem with the Hammond organ trailer into a steam train in lights
for a night parade.

This was the result:
	http://tricolour.net/photos/2010/11/20/train_parade.html

And here is some of the backgrounder on how we got there:
	http://hpv.tricolour.net/train.html

	http://artengine.ca/blog/?p=1733
	http://drumbent.blogspot.com/2010/11/more-hpvooo-parade-fun.html

Some comments from the general public that got back to me indirectly
include "That's the first time downtown Ottawa has heard a real live
train horn in more than 40 years." (In a poor decision on the part of
regional planners, our "central" train station was moved about 5km away
from Parliament Hill sometime in the early 1960s.)

We've got another parade coming up this coming Saturday in a suburb
about 15km away.

Cool - a kind of retro-TRON vibe going there!!!

You are the second person to mention Tron...  It was from my teen era,
but I never really absorbed that subculture then...  After a quick
search, I now understand the reference.

The other guy seemed to be happy about that resemblance.  :)
