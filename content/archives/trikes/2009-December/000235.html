<PRE>Nice pictures Julian,

It looks like a fun adventure!  We have taken our tadpoles on nasty 
trails like that, but it is difficult.  We have been looking at Ketts 
for offroad and sticking to onroad with our non-suspended tadpoles.

I am looking forward to your next tests!

</I>&gt;<i> Went for a ride the other day on prototype suspension trike.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A last minute change of plans (a major bushfire in the area I'd intended to
</I>&gt;<i> go to) meant I went straight over the Great Dividing Range on what turned
</I>&gt;<i> out for much of the distance to be a fire trail through a national park.
</I>&gt;<i> (From Hoskinstown to Braidwood, New South Wales.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the longer trip in mind I was packed for 4 days of self-supported
</I>&gt;<i> touring, including 15 litres of water, food, spares, etc - 39kg of stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Was very tough - only about 20 kilometres for this section but very steep,
</I>&gt;<i> rough, and often wet and slippery dirt. Camped overnight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't expect the road to turn out to be a fire trail (had poor map and no
</I>&gt;<i> phone reception for nav) and I certainly didn't expect it to be so deserted
</I>&gt;<i> - no one passed me for 18 hours or so. So I was a bit disconcerted by the
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty and lack of other people. Knowing what I now know, I would do it
</I>&gt;<i> again, either in the company of others or with an epirb (even a sprained
</I>&gt;<i> ankle would have been very dangerous).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Blew seals in all three suspension dampers (need to do more work on the
</I>&gt;<i> damping) but had no punctures and no other failures. With 16 inch wheels,
</I>&gt;<i> the rear derailleur was at times dragging in the mud - not good. Am now
</I>&gt;<i> developing new damping system.
