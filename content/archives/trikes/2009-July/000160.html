<PRE>&quot; Rider comfort is a function of the seat, not the bike&quot;

Only in machines without suspension

Mr Sims:
It's not an apples to oranges comparison, both designs are easily run
through most major analytical dynamics packages. Since that package will
output the same parameters for both designs they're easy to compare on
the same merits. You know that. Saying that it's &quot;apples to oranges&quot;
only confuses the consumers and further hampers the industry. I'd like
if you stopped doing that. Also, Rider comfort is a function of the
seat, not the bike. When comparing two designs you place them on equal
footing, meaning you remove the rider from the equation in this
instance.

Fran:
Delta trikes tend to have a high CoG, combined with having less traction
up front this means they handle like an American SUV. Tadpole trikes
have a lower CoG, more traction for turning, and a better steering
geometry. Surely your race course has a turn in it?

Or maybe you'd notice that tadpole designs tend to be more recumbent,
reducing frontal area and improving Cd, which helps both top speed and
cruising calorie burn.

Hey, while I'm listing things, How about the fact that the dual front
brakes on a tadpole get the brake bias to a realistic area for safe use.

If you already own a delta, current technology may not have improved
enough since your last purchase to warrant the expenditure for a new
bike, However if it's been a few years I would definitely direct you to
a tadpole model, as delta models have no place in trike racing.
