<PRE>They might seem like they are more suitable for racing, but that's only for 
people who have never ridden them.  I race, commute, do casual rides, 
charity events and ultra rides on it.  The only thing I haven't tried is 
off-road.  With a tilt lock, the trike stays upright on it's own and andhas 
better performance in pretty much every area than any other delta or tadpole 
I've ever ridden.

Thanks for all links about leaning deltas. However they seem more suitable 
for racing than for everyday use or as &quot;touring truck&quot;. My main concern is 
an every day vehicle that is practical but at the same time not too slow or 
heavy and that is not too heavy to pedal on soft ground. It is really hard 
to beat an ordinary upright bike in that respect.

How is the riding qualities? Does it tip over when you are standing still, 
or how do you control the tilting? If it behaves like a two-wheeler, what is 
the benefit of a tilting delta? Isn't riding a two-wheeler just the same but 
with lower weight?
