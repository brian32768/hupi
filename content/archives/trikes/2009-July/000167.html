<PRE>Well, in theory that might be the case, but with the revival of some of the 
tilting delta designs, that is pretty much no longer the case.  I made a 
narrow track FWD tilting delta and it's teh fastest trike I've ever ridden 
or raced, by far.  The tilting deltas corner like a 2 wheeler with none of 
the loss associated with hard cornering on a tadpole.  They also have none 
of the stability concerns of standard deltas, and finally, with a 25&#186; seat 
angle and the rear wheels tucked in behind the seat for maximum aero 
benefit, they have a better aero profile than any conventional delta or 
tadpole out there.
My Max with a 17&quot; track:

Dennis Grelk took his FWD lowracer and made a bolt on tilting rear end for 
it.  His is very fast too.

His first bolt on rear end (just slips into the dropouts) a little smaller 
and simpler than the bolt-on I made for my python.

Then he made a smaller, neater one still with a 10.25&quot; track

Bram Smit of Fast FWD NL fame took his Munzo FWD lowracer and added a 
tilting rear end to it and it'll be another slick new addition to the HPRA 
races starting Manchester, hopefully.

There's also the Jetrike but I don't know if he's further developed it or 
was looking at performance aspects, but there's no reason for it not to 
handle as well as the others.

Finally, there's Jensen from Southern Ontario with another style of titler 
with a very simple tilting rear end mechnism.

All three lined up for the mass start 1 hour at the Ford event in MI.

The Kiwi Aaron Tate's tilter, with a mechanism like Bram's or the Jetrike.

The Aussie Timbo with a Greenspeed style tilter

There's also Rob Gillions from the BHPC with another Greenspeed style 
tilter.
<A HREF="http://www.bhpc.org.uk/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2814&amp;PN=1&amp;SID=568zdf6z6ede612f9fz85czza8765234">http://www.bhpc.org.uk/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2814&amp;PN=1&amp;SID=568zdf6z6ede612f9fz85czza8765234</A>

Thanks to Paul Sims for his inspiration with the original design from 8 or 9 
years ago.  It's an awaesome design that removes most of the negative 
aspects of tapoles and deltas and moves their speed almost to that of a two 
wheeled lowracer and makes them stick in the corners better than a bike.  I 
think if Greenspeed started making them for people, especially the trike 
races in Australia, they'd tear up the track.


&gt;<i>A tadpole will be more stable in a high speed or sharp turn.  The  presence
</I>&gt;<i> of a wheel in the vector of the original path accounts for  it.
