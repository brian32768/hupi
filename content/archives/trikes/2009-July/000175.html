&gt;<i> Thanks for all links about leaning deltas. However they seem more suitable for racing than for everyday use or as &quot;touring truck&quot;. My main concern is an every day vehicle that is practical but at the same time not too slow or heavy and that is not too heavy to pedal on soft ground. It is really hard to beat an ordinary upright bike in that respect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How is the riding qualities? Does it tip over when you are standing still, or how do you control the tilting? If it behaves like a two-wheeler, what is the benefit of a tilting delta? Isn't riding a two-wheeler just the same but with lower weight?

I've seen them with just a parallelogram linkage, which makes them 
handle just like a bike when unlocked. The advantage over a bike is that 
you can lock it when riding slowly - some have a brake disc that lets 
you lock it in any position for cambered roads etc.

But you can also make a &quot;rising&quot; linkage, which means the trike falls 
towards the centre and tends to stay upright. Too much rise is bad 
though because you have to force it into a corner by leaning strongly 
and/or countersteering. I have a teacher friend here in Qld who has had 
his school build a rising leaning delta for Pedal Prix, and he has 
reported it handles very nicely (I've not ridden it yet). It rises for 
the first few degrees of lean from the vertical, and then falls in the 
normal parallelogram fashion. It's a glass monocoque, and faired quite 
tightly so there's no real ability to lean it by moving your body weight.

So many interesting things to build, so little time (I've invested a lot 
of time in a conventional tad with fairing now - funny to describe it as 
conventional :-)
