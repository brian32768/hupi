Hi all,

Long time, not write.

I hope SWMBO will go along with this and let me buy one and be a beta
tester for them - an ELF from Organic Transit, made nearby in Durham NC:

http://www.organictransit.com/models.html

http://www.youtube.com/otvehicles

There isn't anything really new about it, but they have combined what is
out there nicely.

I think I can really make good use of one.  My commute is 23.5 miles each
way.  More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much time.

This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if that
is at full, electric only, speed.  But, it should be fine with a lets and
battery power.   It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall current
in two hours.  So I can easily get to work and back.  It will go a lot
faster than 20mph with leg power.  I might maintain 25mph or more for the
trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter trike.
 It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.  I don't know if it is geared
for higher.

Happy nNew Year,

Mike

I wonder how parking in motorcycle parking spots, would go over with motorcyclists/bylaw officers. ?It would be too difficult to get into bicycle cages, like I use at work.

is there some law in the usa
against a 4-wheeled thing that looks like a sports car,
but weighs only 100 lb ?
why do you suppose that is?

...

thank you for pointing out
where I needed to clarify myself;
I meant a dual-use motor-assisted hpv;
it is the motor assistance that causes problems;
there are many laws concerning safety
but they don't apply to motor bikes,
so to skirt the safety laws
a motor-assisted hpv needs to stay like a motorbike
-- not fully enclosed,
and not more than 3 wheels .
. freedom means being able to buy a
fully-enclosed 4-wheeled sports car
that weighs only 100 lb
-- one I can pedal on flat ground in a school zone,
but then run a motor to keep up with 35mph zones .
. trikes interest me only because they
support velomobile designs
http://amerdreamduh.blogspot.com/p/velomobile.html
and they can provide high stability
even in high winds .
. just looking at the organictransit models
made feel as if I was going to flip over!
. if people would keep their cars under 100lb,
there wouldn't be any need for licenses or insurance .

In general, if it has three wheels, it is usually considered as a
motorcycle. If it has 4 wheels, it is a car, and is subject to all the
safety regulations. Seat belts, bumpers, lights, etc.

The motorcycle and sidecar combination had to stay wedged into the  
regulations due to their continued sales after the other cyclecars  
fell out of favour.  A few countries still offer reduced taxes on  
smaller cars, but there have been no true microcars to consider.   
Also, lawmakers are neither particularly smart no worried about you.

You are all lucky in the USA - here in Australia we instinctively make 
laws against anything that is fun, interesting or useful. Since 
power-assisted bikes/trikes fall into all three categories, and also 
deprive the oil industry of much needed revenue, their manufacture here 
is a stillborn industry.

Yeah, I remember how the helmet laws cut bike ridership in OZ by 80% or so.

Do they actually enforce stuff there?  That is one of the neat things in
NC, all sorts of things run around unlicensed. I presume the coppers have
more important fish to fry. I had a scooter pace me up a hilly at 40mph+ a
couple weeks ago.  Hard to figure why that isn't a motorcycle.

Folks trundle around on public roads with there golf carts, four wheelers
are brazen.

Most people don't know electric assist when they see it.  So you could
cobble most anything together here.  It is when you try to market in volume
that it gets tricky.

They don't enforce usually. But they certainly can, even though the law 
is unenforceable at it stands. The 200 watt limit ensures electric 
assists never become useful car-replacements.

I dont' know about the USA, but in my Canadian province, this would be considered a bicycle, unless the electric assist didn't cut out by 33kmh (20mph).

I was thinking about how to park it for free, in an urban area where many on-street vehicle parking spots are metered and it wouldn't fit in most spaces available to bicycle parking. ?In Vancouver city, we also have dedicated on-street motorcycle parking spots, which are cheaper.

The law in Oz has changed recently. Already in in most states . WA and 
SA I think still to go.

The new law is the Euro standard. 250W , speed cutout at 25 kmh and 
works via pedalling. No throttle.

The new laws in Oz will affect some bike shops, and the people
importing from Europe will love them. But the people importing from
China/Asia don't care because they don't follow them. It's easy to buy
a "bicycle" here that has a 400W motor, throttle and decorative
pedals. For under $1000. Spend a bit more and you often get something
with less power (and smaller but still entirely imaginary chance of
being prosecuted).

The real issue is the IC powered ones, with poorly made two stroke
engines bolted to poorly made bicycles. People ride them on the
off-road shared paths with no regard for basically anything. The
problem is getting worse because, again, they're being brought in and
sold cheaply as bicycles.

Michael Ross said:
> Yeah, I remember how the helmet laws cut bike ridership in OZ by 80% or so.

50%, ish. Death rate went up to compensate though, so we have fewer
deaths but the remaining cyclists have a greater chance of dying.
Numbers today are greater than before helmets, just because cycling
numbers are growing pretty darn fast.

> Do they actually enforce stuff there?

Some things, yes. Helmet laws, for example. Power assist laws they
don't even try because it requires training to be able to tell (and
even then it really requires a lab test). With the electric ones I can
sympathise, most of them are "one less car" and many motors are "X
watts at Y volts" so who really knows anyway.



One useful thing with the rule change is that it makes power assisted
velomobiles much safer. Having more power but cutting out at 25kph
means that stuff like the Trisled Avatar will be less able to reach
the 80kph or so on the flat that a fit rider with 200W power assist
should be able to manage. Of course, they're now more likely to be
pulled over to check :)

One of Ben at Trisled's concerns is that a US-legal 500W motor could
easily push his velomobiles to speeds they're not really designed to
crash at. He's more about "200W gets you 50kph" because that's what a
reasonably fit cyclist should be able to put out unassisted.

Luckily the linked vehicles are built for the other end of the speed
spectrum :)

Riding my velo around I keep thinking I don't want power assist so
much as "kick me up to speed" assist. I'm thinking a small
RC-helicopter style motor that's only good for 30s at a time, but that
would get me to 30kph or so much faster that I can do it by myself.
Combines with a smallish power pack from RC toys, it could make for a
very lightweight addition. I'm also looking at the disk rotor mount of
the Rohloff and wondering about using that.

I vaguely recall one of the CF lowracer guys having built one but
can't recall the details.

Is anyone doing this, or better, making a kit?

You have been around awhile, so you may have already seen this, but FWIW John Tetz did a lot of work with minimal assist.

I'd say something like a Stokemonkey setup. Lots of large cheap motors and
lithium batteries.
Try hobbyking.com for motors, batteries and charges. Should be able to
build a nice assist motor but at a fraction of the size.
Biggest problem would be adapting a freewheel or similar to the smaller
electric motor shaft. Easily doable on a lathe....
Check it out.
http://clevercycles.com/blog/products/stokemonkey/
We are getting a new cnc router at work this month. I might get a chance to
cut some aluminum brackets to mount motor to frame with support for a frame.
Check out http://www.ecalc.ch/motorcalc_e.htm if you really want to go with
a prop type drive.
Any question feel free to ask :)

Paul

The OT velo is using RC stuff, but I don't know any specifics.  If I did
know I would need to keep quiet because I've done the preliminary paperwork
to be a beta tester.  NDA signed and all that.

If you look at the Team <http://www.organictransit.com/team.html> link on
the OT website you will see the founders are all pretty well set with bona
fides.  I have met Rob Cotter.  He seems pretty sharp.  Not a novice.

The UK/EU limit for electric bikes is also 200W, but that's the limit for
bikes that legally count (for almost all purposes) as pedal bikes, and can
be ridden without insurance, without a driving test or licence, etc..
It that the same in Australia?

200W is closer to an elite athlete's average power output than a typical
cyclist, so _if it was used efficiently_ would already be pushing the limits
of being an "assist" rather than an electric powered vehicle.
(Though electric assist bikes can't keep that power output up for anything
like, say, the whole of a Tour de France stage.)

http://www.atob.org.uk/electric-motorbikes-scooters/electric-motorbike-scooter-licensing-laws/
https://www.gov.uk/electric-bike-rules
http://www.bikeradar.com/gear/article/electric-bikes-and-the-law-29969/

But if a "useful car-replacement" can e.g. carry four people like a typical
car, it's going to need a sizeable motor, not just an assist. Many people
do use cars for journeys that could sensibly be done by bike, and in some
cases an assist might encourage that, but that replaces some fraction of
car journeys rather than really being a replacement for a car.

Getting light electric vehicles on the road legally is much trickier, but
having car-replacements legislated as cars doesn't seem unreasonable.

is the site's inclusion of a real designer:
C. Michael Lewis claims the title for building
the World's Most Efficient Electric Vehicle.
. his intro has links to electrathonamerica.org

where every car is built efficiently
http://www.electrathonamerica.org/News.html
and some look like real vehicles,
not politically correct bugs .
. sit up straight like your mama said ...
. I do like their TruckIt however
because it's a nice motorhome not just a vehicle !
(USA capitalists sent my job to china,
then USA bankers took my house,
I live in my TruckIT now, outside of USA city limits... )

I was surprised one day, to have a truck-driving friend of mine  
delightedly declare that he had just gotten qualified to drive a  
tractor without a trailer - bobtailing.  The TruckIt looks similarly  
treacherous if unladen.  I like to be able to brake and turn at the  
same time when things get exciting.

Carrying a 60 Watt panel around does not make a velomobil "solar powered" and trickle charging a lithium battery is a really bad idea and on the dangerous side.
A 60W panel generates 45-50W/day, so all it will do is feeding your lights or phones for some time, but compare this to the 750 W electric assist.. (and the panel is 12V, the motor 36 or more..) -
 better to leave the panel at home and win on less weight..

. safety laws are still hindering efficiency;
because when you enter the family car class
you add 100's of pounds of crash-proofing ...
the key to safety is remembering Natural law;
people cannot not trust green lights,
so we need to replace them with radials,
or more limited-access arrangements .
. in the meantime, we should also promote
air-conditioned full-face helmets,
that have a vest system
that includes a spine protection system .
. it also has a forced air hepa carbon filter
to help you ride cleanly in the smog .
. it is perched on the spine&kidney support
so you hardly feel it except when turning your head .

My thoughts exactly.  The two in the back sort of creeps me out when you
can just do two in the front.

However, I have seen Ketts handle really well, so low CG may mitigate a lot
of this trouble.   There is nothing to say they can't get the CG low on the
TruckIT if they work at it. Cushman had a going concern making little yard
dogs and delivery vans in delta configuration.

I am not sure yet why anyone would sniff or sneeze at the ELF.  It may be
very good at the sort of urban noodling and shopping they are marketing it
for.  A bit pricey for all that, but still it does have merit - having
ridden one.   It seems to be popular, and that in itself is important.  I
wonder if Lewis has actually driven an ELF.

Over 200W and it has to be registered. Impossible with any sort of 
bicycle-based device, and even with the right gear it's a 
legal/engineering minefield. On the plus side, there are well-defined 
pathways for getting EV conversions registered, so the law is being 
sensibly administered there.

By "useful car replacement" I meant something that could carry you and 
some shopping without compromising handling and braking. Weather 
protection (e.g. a velo) would be a definite plus.

@Lui,
sorry if you didn't find affection in my
razz about USA's ways of doing things;
I don't live on the street,
and the TruckIt is not my thing;
but, are you sure about 60W panel size?
that is for the Elf not the TruckIt .
. and what makes you think it's dangerous?
don't trust a USA regulator? ;) .

The 60W panel currently being put on the OT ELF doesn't weight a half a
kilo.    They are working on sourcing a 120W panel, slight better, and some
what longer and wider as I understand it.  If that doubles  which is not an
entirely unreasonable wish for the future, you really have something.

60W is fine to charge fully during a work day if the sun is bright.  But
you would need to plug in overnight if commuting.  For my commute the cost
of plugged power would be $0.10 versus $5 to put gas in my car.  Wear and
tear comparison is bound to be better as well.  Not bad.

Incorrect charging will indeed cause problems with Li cells, but it is also
possible to do it correctly.

We had an electric scooter (with 48V 20Ah LiFe pack) Scooter range 40km, battery pack replaced after some month /warranty, 2nd pack dead after 20 months. Costs for battery, shipping, handling etc around Euro 1180 ( Dollar 1550) The scooter did 7600 km, now add the charging costs and one replaced charging unit (90 Euro)

You like to make provocative statements.  I must ask you to defend them a
bit.

"From an ecological view charging the vehicle from plug means coal, oil,
gas, atomic plants as energy source plus conversion and line losses; would
be interesting how much oil has to be burnt for a full charge of the pack."

I suspect that the $0.10 or so I have to pay for a kilowatt hour really is
the cost of the power - plus some profit.  The local utilities are not in
the habit of giving their product away for free.

"> 60W is fine to charge fully during a work day if the sun is bright.  But

Yes nice, but it would not drive the trike.."

I really don't understand your comment.   The battery pack holds 480Watt
hours so a kWh ought to charge it

<http://www.organictransit.com/models.html>
Specs:  http://www.organictransit.com/models.html

That provides 30 miles of assistance (I am not sure how that is portioned
out pedal work vs battery work).  I believe this is already proven.  They
have been built and tested.  So on what basis do you challenge this?

"> Incorrect charging will indeed cause problems with Li cells, but it is

> possible to do it correctly.

Not with trickle charging Li batteries."

Again, I am not following your thought process here.  I am not sure how you
mean trickle charging.

There is a charge controller used to properly manage battery charging.
 Perhaps this is different from whatever you mean by trickle charging.

It is pretty clear that Li batteries can be charged so that there are no
problems. Why do you think it is not possible for this system to do
likewise?

Or are you just saying that the OT people must be lying?  You should have
some valid basis for that other than opinion.

Are you privy to the specifications of systems implemented on this machine?

Are you aware of some technological reason why they cannot be charged
correctly from a solar cell, whether it be 60W, 120W, or 240W?

Regards,

MIke

scuse me for butting in, but the best info on making fast e-bicycles is on a forum with a weird name - endlesssphere

They are using the 2K-6K Turnigy motors and others on bicycles. Its hard to keep them cool, but you get a lot of power
out of a small package. There is a lot of experimentation there, a huge amount really. Guys are racing them at kart
tracks and beating the gas bikes.

check it out.

I was talking about my own cost.  I will get payback in pretty decent time
if the thing functions as planned.  it will cost me about $0.10 to charge
it once by wall current and if I park it on a sunny day while I work it
will charge just fine for free.  Compare that to my gas cost to drive my
car of about $5 at today's prices give or take a bit.

Please don't get snotty, there is no reason for that.  You read something
into this that I never said.
But, it IS solar and electric, if you plug in some times, and you leave it
in the sun other times, it will charge either way.

It is has a 60W cell right now.  And it is set up to be plugged in as the
main source of power.  If you park it for 7 hours they on a roughly
1000W/m^2 day you will get a full charge (we get 1300W/m^2 but it probably
averages out lower depending on what you define as a day for averaging).

60W cell, that clearly will not work as the sole source if you ride beyond
30miles plus whatever is offset by pedaling.   OT thinks that 240 watts
from a mounted solar cell is possible in the future.  At that rate you
would only need wall power it it is overcast.  That seems like a reasonable
statement to me.  There is already room for a 120W panel on it.

By your definition then, the OT ELF is not trickle charged.  It is a
controlled charge.  There should be no problems letting the sun charge
it because the process is manged to keep the batteries healthy.

If I ever said it was trickle charged (I do not believe I did), then I
misspoke.

Battery and charger ca. 900 Dollar will last at best for 3 years, power typically bows down after 250 cycles..

Its not you, in all the writing about Elf and TruckIt you will find the "solar driven", website or reports, cannot find  it runs mainly from plug ..

Charging a 48 V battery with a 12V Panel > step up converter> losses 20%, charging a lithium battery 10-30 % losses on primary energy, depending on temperature and other factors.
With the earnings from a 60W panel you can fire up two  10 W lamps for 2 hours in winter and 8 hours in summer.. and dont try to tell me something about solar. our house runs on it since 1987..
