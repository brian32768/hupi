Subject: [trikes] easy setting of  toe
Message-ID: <002c01cabd0e$2e18f5e0$8a4ae1a0$@edgar@bigpond.com>

If you have a trike with negative front camber, or there is toe or camber
change with suspension movement, setting the toe by the traditional
measuring method can be very difficult to get right - where 'right' =
minimum rolling resistance.
 
But - and maybe everyone already knows about this but I didn't - there's a
very easy way to do it. 
 
Connect one tie rod and leave the other off at one end (eg the outer end).
Ride along slowly, going straight ahead. (That is, steer straight ahead with
the one connected wheel.) The disconnected wheel will track truly. Stop
without further changing the steering. 
 
Adjust the tie rod length so that the disconnected tie rod rose-joint
matches the position of the wheel. On my trike, with a vertical threaded
spud, I adjust the free tie rod length so that the rose-joint drops straight
over the spud. 
 
On my trike, my minimum rolling resistance actually looks to have toe-out (I
run neg camber).

Julian Edgar

Does this work regardless of scrub radius?   Have you verified the 
results with a coast-down test?

Does this work regardless of scrub radius? - not sure; I've tried it only on
my current trike that runs negative scrub radius.

Have you verified the results with a coast-down test? - I haven't; I have
not had much luck with coast-down tests as an accurate and repeatable test.

On a smooth concrete surface like my workshop floor, physically moving the
disconnected wheel (by pulling or pushing on the wheel steer lever) to move
it away from its 'natural' steer direction takes lots of effort (and the
amount of effort would also depend on the castor being used), and when the
wheel is aimed at a direction different to its natural direction, rolling
resistance clearly and noticeably rises (the trike slows abruptly).  

Setting toe as described also reduces the sound that can be heard on some
surfaces when there is some wheel scrub caused by incorrect toe.

Julian Edgar

I should also add that I set-up the Ackerman compensation in much the same
way - steering one wheel at tight lock and then letting the other find its
natural angle, then organising the steering linkage to allow this to always
occur. It was very useful in fine tuning the angles.

Subject: [trikes] New Tire Recommendations?
Message-ID: <4B9CF244.7010901@zalonoffice.com>

I must be approaching a world-record: 3 flats on the same wheel in 3 
days, each discovered in the morning as I was about to go riding. The 
flats occurred at different points on the tube, and the holes were small 
enough not to have caused any loss of pressure during the ride. (No, 
there is not any glass in my garage!) Each time I removed the tire and 
carefully checked inside, to make sure that I had not picked up a piece 
of glass or some other sliver; and each time the inside of the tire was 
perfectly clean.

The suspect is the right front tire of my 8 year-old  Greenspeed GTO 
with its original Tioga Comp Pool tires (with (@ 7,000 miles) still on 
the front wheels. During all this time, I think I have had only a 
handful of flats, all but one on the right front. That makes sense, 
because that's the tire that is closest to the curb and therefore most 
likely to pick up the road detritus that lays in wait for unsuspecting 
cyclists.

Perhaps one reason for all these flats is that we have had a tremendous 
amount of snow here in North Jersey, and the roads -- especially the 
portion closest to the curb -- are probably filled with the junk that 
would otherwise be cleaned up by street sweepers. Anyone have any other 
explanation?

In any event, it's probably a good idea to buy some new tires. I have 
not found much in the way of reviews of different trike tires and wonder 
if any of you have strong feelings about one tire or the other? Like the 
new Scorchers.

Any comments will be welcomed.

Thanks,

Jules

Jules,

I have always felt that chance plays a large factor in the frequency of
flats.  I am sure many people change tire make and model because they get
two flats in close temporal proximity, where it was really just luck.  It is
in our nature to seek reasons and patterns even before we have sufficient
data to make valid decisions.

Given that everything I say has to be filtered through the knowledge that I
may be confusing coincidence with good statistical reasoning.

I believe that the curbside wheel gets more flats because there is more
trash there than towards the crown of the road.

I think wet roads cause more flats.  The theory here (not my own, but I keep
it under advisement) is that the water makes slicing cuts easier and glass
slivers can cause more damage before breaking up. This agrees with another
observation of mine that I can cut rubber with a blade more easily if I have
water present - it does seem to lubricate the blade so it cuts more smoothly
and quickly.

I have more flats in winter time.  I think the roads are dirtier for some
reason.

 I think I get more flats on trikes than on two wheelers.  But with trikes I
think it is harder to evade problems (not that I am very attentive).

How a tire is weighted makes a difference - I almost never flatted the front
tires of my BikeEs which are VERY lightly loaded.

Really thin tires don't get much use on my bikes.  I like fat tires.  But, I
like them to be soft and flexible.  I sometimes pump them up tight and other
times not.

(Lot's of variables and differing conditions to be making comparisons, eh?)

Also, I am very non-reactive to flats in terms of giving up on tires and
changing brands.  And I tend to ride on the same sorts of roads and
conditions most of the time.  Even so the occurrence of flats seems to
oscillate for no apparent reason - sometimes more, sometimes less.

How large and high quality is my sample (Mike's flats as a predictor for all
flats)?  I think I have had maybe a hundred in 10 years.    I remember a
time when I had a flat on every ride for five rides straight, a couple rides
had multiple flats.   A few of them were my fault for doing a poor job of
mounting them.  I don't keep a log so maybe my record keeping is
suspect.  How good is my memory?  I don't give it that much credit, but this
a topic that gets cogitated upon for hours on rides.

I like Comp Pools, Primo Comets, and Panaracer Pasela.  I would buy
Scorchers.  Kenda Kwest have been good to me.  I have tried a variety of
slicks, and city tires and have no particular beef with any of them.

I hate tires that are hard to mount.  That is probably the main reason why I
won't buy a tire a second time.  This is not an issue with Greenspeeds and
their nice rims.  The only rim I know of specifically designed to make
changing the tire easy.

I would take the cost of replacing a pretty new tire and spend it on patch
kits and tire irons I like.  A good pump like a Morph can't be beat.

i realize that the flats are only on one side but with 7000 miles that tire carcass has got to be getting a little worn.  i can't help but feel that those wear markers have long been passed.  i always replace when either the wear markers are passed or fabric starts to show.  of course when i see fabric i know how lucky i have been to that point.  

what is it about bent riders that we hate to spend money after the initial purchase.  i like to get tires once a year.  something about the smell of new rubber in the color black.

Hello Jules

Another opinion.  When I got my GTO I was still recovering from a herniated
disc condition and found that a smooth as possible ride was needed.  I tried
Schwalbe, Big Apple, 60mm and have really liked these tires.  Probably have
4000 miles on these and the center tread is gone, but like you say, I have
just not wanted to spend the money to replace yet.  I have gotten a few
flats, but in every case what I dug out of the treads would have gone
through most tires.   I run these at a very low pressure ( I know Michael
Ross thinks I am a little crazy for this).  I started using 40psi and about
1 year ago decided to change to 30psi to see what would happen. Can't tell a
lot of change, but it does not seem to add perceptible rolling resistance --
but no real testing has been done.  Schwalbe indicates that the recommended
low pressure is 22psi.   These tires have a good grip -- it is even
difficult to push the trike sideways in the garage to get it out of the way.

Middle of last year I had to start riding my mtn bike since I broke a rib in
my back and the trike reclining position was too painful.  So decided to try
the Big Apple on the mtn bike.  Worked quite well.  I really liked the quiet
relative to knobby tires on asphalt.  I was running with 30psi.  I could
even do easy single track, but would occasionally lose traction on roots and
muddy areas where a knobby tire is really needed.

A few things no one has mentioned. 

Tyre changes can make quite a large difference to handling, especially in
steering response.  One of my trikes I built and set-up on one type of tyre,
and when I changed to another type of tyre the handling was quite twitchy -
so I went back to the first tyre brand and model. 

I think suspension massively reduces the chance of punctures - especially
pinch-flats. On my suspension machines I have only ever had one puncture,
and that includes running at times at 20 psi tyre pressures.


Regards,

Julian Edgar

Hello Jules

Another opinion.  When I got my GTO I was still recovering from a herniated
disc condition and found that a smooth as possible ride was needed.  I tried
Schwalbe, Big Apple, 60mm and have really liked these tires.  Probably have
4000 miles on these and the center tread is gone, but like you say, I have
just not wanted to spend the money to replace yet.  I have gotten a few
flats, but in every case what I dug out of the treads would have gone
through most tires.   I run these at a very low pressure ( I know Michael
Ross thinks I am a little crazy for this).  I started using 40psi and about
1 year ago decided to change to 30psi to see what would happen. Can't tell a
lot of change, but it does not seem to add perceptible rolling resistance --
but no real testing has been done.  Schwalbe indicates that the recommended
low pressure is 22psi.   These tires have a good grip -- it is even
difficult to push the trike sideways in the garage to get it out of the way.

Middle of last year I had to start riding my mtn bike since I broke a rib in
my back and the trike reclining position was too painful.  So decided to try
the Big Apple on the mtn bike.  Worked quite well.  I really liked the quiet
relative to knobby tires on asphalt.  I was running with 30psi.  I could
even do easy single track, but would occasionally lose traction on roots and
muddy areas where a knobby tire is really needed.

I have used Scorchers with Kelvar on my Kettwiesel.  No flats in 6000 miles.  On all my recumbents I have always tried to get tires with Kelvar.  When I couldn't I used tire liners.  Over the years I have had very few flats.  I have a 3 speed hub on the rear of my Gold Rush and it makes for real problems if I would have to fix a flat so I am running that with a Slime tube.  One interesting side light is that with the Slime tube I don't have to add air very often.  Kind of nice.

That is an interesting note...
Curiously I concur - I didn't have a flat on my Quest...
You could be on to something.
I never ride tyres soft enough for pinch flats (that is what pumps with gauges are for).
Struggling to think why suspension should make a difference to puncture rate tho.

the front the first set lasted 4,500 miles, the second set 4,750 miles 
and the third set 5,350 miles.  On the back I got 2,000 miles, 5,000 
miles, 3,700 miles and 1,900 miles (the lower mileages were retired due 
to BIG glass cuts).  I can no longer get Comp Pools so am currently 
using Schawlbe Marathons (the standard Marathon) and have about 2,000 
miles so far. The comp Pools are a nice tyre - I normally only got lots 
of punctures towards the end - where I live in NE England the urban 
roads and urban cycle tracks receive a regular top dressing of broken 
glass, so I wish I could get more Comp Pools.

On my Trice XXL (20 inch 406 wheels) I have used Schawlbe  Marathon 
Slicks (no longer made) - 3,000 and 4,000 miles for two front wheel 
sets, and 1,700, 2,300, 2,900 and 2,300 miles on the back - the largest 
mileages (front and back) was too far - I suffered far too many 
punctures for the last 500 miles or so but was away on a tour.  I then 
put some rubbish tyres on the front and the final Slick on the back and 
replaced them all with Greenspeed Scorchers the next summer before 
setting off on a tour to France - I suffered more punctures than the 
other 7 people on the tour put together - and the Scorchers were a very 
very (VERY) tight fit on the Trice rims - after 2,100 miles they were 
worn out (I suspect that the Trice Rims are slightly oversize to keep 
tires on, while the Greenspeed Scorcher tyres are slightly undersize to 
keep them on - in combination the result is a nightmare).  My next 
tyres were Schawlbe  Marathon Racers - these are a nice fast tyre and 
pretty good for punctures when new - I have had mileages of 3,800, 
2,400 and 2,000 (on all three wheels) from Racers.  Last summer I ran a 
set of Schawlbe Kojaks on  my XXL - these are very light and very fast 
tyres -I only had 1 puncture but they only lasted 1,400 miles and there 
was very little rubber (if any) left in the centre by then.  For the 
last 200 miles I have being using Schawlbe Marathon Supremes - these 
seem to be good, but too soon to say really.

On my Trice Micro (16 inch 3349 wheels), I started with Brompton tyres 
and took them off after 3,600 miles because I got fed up with the lack 
of grip - if approaching a road junction where I might have to stop, if 
it was wet it was advisable to start slowing down well in advance (half 
a mile or so) as the result of applying the brakes was that the wheels 
stopped rotating - no other effect at all on speed was apparent (may be 
a slight exaggeration ).  I then ran Schawlbe Stelvios on the front and 
a standard Schawlbe Marathon on the back - the Stelvios (a very thin 
tyre which are no longer made) gave mileages of 1,200, 1,300 and 1,100 
miles on the left wheel and 2,100 and 1,600 on the right wheel.  On the 
back the Marathons gave mileages of 2,400 and more than 1,300 (tyre 
transfered to my Brompton).  Since then I have being using Greenspeed 
Scorchers - unlike with the 406 tyres on my XXL, on my Micro there is 
no problem fitting them and I have not suffered excessive punctures - 
on the front I have had 3,100 miles from the first set - the second set 
is still in use with 1,900 miles so far..  On the back there are 
clearance problems - the gear mech is VERY close to the ground and to 
the tyre - I have destroyed two Scorchers - the first after a rear 
wheel puncture - I got about 1 mile before BIG BANG and the tyre failed 
- the gear mech had grounded after the first puncture and been bent, so 
in the lowest gear the mech was trying to run inside the tyre - not a 
good idea - and the second after a spoke broke and the wheel warped so 
the mech was just touching the tyre in low gear - and I had a faulty 
tyre as well (it failed on the left side-wall, so the gear mech 
definitely did not cause that - but was replaced by Greenspeed with no 
quibbles) - so cannot give a tyre life for the rear wheel yet.

What I did not say above is that the worst experience I have had for 
punctures was when I was using the Schawlbe Marathons on my Greenspeed 
- I got them in Belgium and used them for 1,100 miles in Belgium, 
Netherlands and England with no problems but when I spent six days on a 
cycle holiday in Shropshire cycling 300 miles, I had 16 punctures - and 
I had a further 4 puncture on the 250 mile ride home - whenever I could 
find the cause of a puncture, it was a thorn - the farmers in 
Shropshire were busy cutting their hedges and I suspect the 4 punctures 
on the way home were due to thorns which took a while longer to work 
their way through to the inner tube.

Tyre life and puncture numbers is very much down to where you ride - my 
worst tyres lives and (apart from the French trip and the Shropshire 
holiday - see above) most numerous punctures were on my Brompton when I 
worked - most days I used it for a train/cycle commute, cycling about 
20 miles a week - but most of that was along the quayside in Newcastle 
passing numerous pubs and the resultant broken glass - since I stopped 
working I have had hardly any punctures on my Brompton and tyres seem 
to last many times longer - but I rarely cycle along the quayside now.

I have had good luck with the comp pools on my GTO and Tandem  Greenspeeds. 
 My newest Greenspeed came with scorchers and I found it  extremely 
difficult to get them off the rim of the tire.  I switched to  comppools ( I had a 
stockpile) and no problems.  It may just be the  particular rims, but 
scorchers are not for my trikes.

Thanks for the comment, Bob. 22 lbs? That's a bit too soft for me, 
although I haven't spent a lot of time pumping up the trike tires. I 
generally pump them up to around 75-80 psi; then leave them alone for a 
month or so. Eventually I check and find them @ 40, and then pump them 
up again. Interestingly, the 3 flats followed immediately on the heels 
of my pumping them back up to 80 psi. I guess no surprise there, since 
really hard tires will attack any shard they find along the roadway.

Cheers.

Jules

That isn't obvious, is it?

Because the suspension gives a bit - it is as if you have contacted the
poking thing at a slower speed.  But do I believe this really makes a
different when we are talking about a sliver of glass?  I am not sure I do.


IMO Suspension should reduce some snakebite flats, but not punctures or
slices.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my tire inquiry. The book will be 
out in a few months!

No, seriously, I truly enjoyed reading the contributions -- all of them. 
Clearly, there were four contributing factors: 1) the roadway was full 
of detritus from the snow and the failure of the towns to clean the 
streets; (2) the right front tire was running right through the junk; 
(3) I had just pumped the tires up to 80 psi (failed to mention that . . 
. Sorry!) and (4) I had had no flats in over a year, so statistically my 
time was up.

Now that spring is in the air here in West Orange, N.J., maybe the towns 
will start sweeping the roads once more. Until then, I may just ride a 
bit farther out in the road, at least until a car is about to overtake 
me. Actually, since I alternate between my GTO and an upright racer, I 
may just ride the upright a bit more until the roads get cleaner.

But it hasn't been all that bad: look at all the practice I've gotten 
fixing flats. I don't even have to remove the wheel: just tip the trike 
over on its side, remove the tube, fix it or install a new one and push 
the tire back onto the rim.

Cheers,

Jules

Ah, a clue! The rocksalt used here sometimes has small quartz needles in it that go straight through bike tyres!
If your snow is only just clearing and leaving piles of the stuff around....
