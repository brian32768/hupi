<PRE>Well now, I'll join in. I'm a Greenspeed guy, but I have to admit I've never ridden any other trike. My first GS was a GT-5 - a folder with a 40-degree seat back. I liked it a lot; no complaints, even riding in the Berkeley hills and East Bay streets.

Then I upgraded to an X-5 folder, with a 30-degree seat back, which I now prefer - better aerodynamics. On a trike, i don't mind a high bottom bracket. relative to seat height. On both trikes, I found the Gator hydraulic brakes excellent - zero maintenance in 5 years. Downhill at 50 mph once, on a city street, was terrifying. My normally effortless steering, at that speed, swerved widely with the slightest touch. Brake steer, on my GS, does happen, of course, when using unequal force to one side or the other - but it is not difficult to steer dead ahead while braking equally with both sides. I've never really desired suspension, either. The trikes jolts with every unevenness in the pavement, but the sling mesh seat effectively isolates my body from the vibrations.

I recently installed a Rohloff 14-speed rear hub, with new double Q-rings up front - 53t and 39t, I believe. That set-up seems to work well, although the manners of the new transmission take some getting-used-to. If I had unlimited money to spend and space in my workshop/garage, I'd try a Catrike Speed, and maybe an ICE Q.

Happy riding to all!

</I>&gt;<i> Although my TerraTrike 3.4 has served me well for seven years, I have the
</I>&gt;<i> 7-year itch.  There are a few features or options I would like to have that
</I>&gt;<i> weren't available when I snagged the TT.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In no particular order, here are some features lacking from the TT.  (I have

</I>&gt;<i> trike box.)  Please add to this list your own pet gripes.  By the time this
</I>&gt;<i> thread dies I hope something will take shape that is commercially available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Fixed seat: Mine is set at about the same standard angle as my wife's
</I>&gt;<i> GTC and never gets reset.  And it creaks and wobbles from old age - the
</I>&gt;<i> trike, that is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Sturdy idlers:  Those original equipment delrins lasted about 2 weeks.
</I>&gt;<i> Got the TerraCycle versions and no problems since.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Easy to remove front wheels:  The TT takes a 24mm wrench.  I much prefer
</I>&gt;<i> the GTC simple hex removal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  Built-in mounting options: I like the GS post system, for example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5.  Easier-to-mount fenders if a rack is also present.  TT owners know what
</I>&gt;<i> I am talking about - at least if you have an earlier model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6.  Wider gear range - or at least more granny gears:  The 17-92 gear-inch
</I>&gt;<i> range barely cuts it at times.  I don't race, but I spin out at around
</I>&gt;<i> 27-28mph going downhill.  At the low end, some of the hills around here are
</I>&gt;<i> real killers.  The GTC has a 3x hub that is pretty nice, but I'm not going
</I>&gt;<i> to sink that much cash into the TT at this point.  Give it to me as an
</I>&gt;<i> option on a new trike and I won't squeal so much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 7.  Less twitchy steering.  When I hit 35mph it gets squirrely; at 40 it is
</I>&gt;<i> terrifying.  And that is after aligning the wheels - a real pain, by the
</I>&gt;<i> way.  I never really have confidence that I have done a good job.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 8.  Less brake steer: the hills again.  At high speeds, the brakes require
</I>&gt;<i> extraordinary skill to avoid swerving all over the road when slowing.  (I

</I>&gt;<i> Well, my homebuilt had nice steady steering and no brake steer.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> handgrip travel was about 4X greater than is common on trikes for the 
</I>&gt;<i> same amount of turning.  I used long levers, and a large turning 
</I>&gt;<i> circle.  I made U-turns and T-turns the same as I would in a car.  Both 
</I>&gt;<i> front brakes worked from the same handgrip, and the steering had 1/2&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> positive scrub radius with a bit of toe-in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I used to get a dozen messages a day from lists like this.  Has 
</I>&gt;<i> everybody moved to Facebook?

</I>&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i>      Sounds to me like you need an ICE &quot;T&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a Trice Explorer .... earlier relative of the &quot;T&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all  ICE give you a customer service second to none.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, they ain't cheap but how often are you going to buy a trike
</I>&gt;<i> ... I have had mine for 10 years now and I don't expect to get another.  Mind 
</I>&gt;<i> you, David Whitman's Velomobile makes me drool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The steering on the Explorer is great .. I have descended Hecker Pass (towards 
</I>&gt;<i> Gilroy .. nice surface, sweeping bends)  at over 50 mph with no problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Explorer has no brake steer and will pull up straight with only one front 
</I>&gt;<i> brake.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My Explorer has the SRAM Dual Drive which ICE does not supply any more. 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a 12-36 rear cassette and a 44-34-22 front triple on a 155mm crank 
</I>&gt;<i> which gives me a range of 22*20/36 at the bottom and 44*20/12 for the top ... 
</I>&gt;<i> about 12&quot;-74&quot;.  Being an Old Fart I find the top is sufficient .. if I am going 
</I>&gt;<i> that fast I dont pedal :-) and the bottom gets me up most hills.  With the 
</I>&gt;<i> dual drive the range goes from 9-100. I have the bar-end type gear changers( 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't change these for the worlds) and Hope hydraulic disc brakes ... if I 
</I>&gt;<i> do an emergency stop (like I just noticed the traffic lights are red) I can bury 
</I>&gt;<i> the front chainring in the asphalt.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure you can get a dual drive rear wheel but you may have to get it made 
</I>&gt;<i> specially.  The &quot;T&quot; folds and you can get various quick release goodies which 
</I>&gt;<i> make folding a snap but of course with the SRAM drive you cannot QR the rear 
</I>&gt;<i> wheel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can get a fancy rack with the &quot;T&quot; and all-round fenders.  The seat angle 
</I>&gt;<i> is adjustable !! 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the 10 years I have had my trike (16000 miles), I have changed out the rear 
</I>&gt;<i> cluster twice because of wear, the crankset once to change to 155mm from 170mm 
</I>&gt;<i> (spin, spin), the chain (all 2.5 standard chains ) twice (wear and new drive 
</I>&gt;<i> train), the front chainrings once (wear), the front and rear idlers once and 
</I>&gt;<i> the trackrod ends once (at 4k miles ... they were worn out .. the new ones 
</I>&gt;<i> have no perceptable wear after a further 12K miles) .. oh and three sets of 
</I>&gt;<i> tires.  All told I have spent about $1000 in 10 years .. $100 a year ain't 
</I>&gt;<i> bad.

</I>&gt;<i> I never thought I would ever want to quit my current ride: the last Trice custom Explorer that ICE ever built.  Before that, they had built a custom XL for me.  I only left that one because I needed a relatively lower bottom bracket. When the first &quot;off the shelf&quot; models appeared, I wasn't impressed.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fast forward to today, and I think these new full suspension Adventures and Sprints are as well-designed and built as any of their customs - which is saying something.  I've had both TerraTrikes (3.3) and Greenspeeds (GTO) and they're fine machines but you might want to look at these new ICE offerings. They have an awful lot going for them and they're better and 'way cheaper than what I had to pay for my customs.  I, too, am getting the itch.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, my homebuilt had nice steady steering and no brake steer.  The handgrip travel was about 4X greater than is common on trikes for the same amount of turning.  I used long levers, and a large turning circle.  I made U-turns and T-turns the same as I would in a car.  Both front brakes worked from the same handgrip, and the steering had 1/2&quot; positive scrub radius with a bit of toe-in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, I used to get a dozen messages a day from lists like this.  Has everybody moved to Facebook?
