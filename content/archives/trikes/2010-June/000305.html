</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although my TerraTrike 3.4 has served me well for seven years, I have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 7-year itch.  There are a few features or options I would like to have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that weren't available when I snagged the TT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In no particular order, here are some features lacking from the TT.  (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have already added some to my TT, but would like them straight out of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new trike box.)  Please add to this list your own pet gripes.  By the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time this thread dies I hope something will take shape that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commercially available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.  Fixed seat: Mine is set at about the same standard angle as my wife's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GTC and never gets reset.  And it creaks and wobbles from old age - the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trike, that is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.  Sturdy idlers:  Those original equipment delrins lasted about 2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weeks. Got the TerraCycle versions and no problems since.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.  Easy to remove front wheels:  The TT takes a 24mm wrench.  I much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefer the GTC simple hex removal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.  Built-in mounting options: I like the GS post system, for example.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5.  Easier-to-mount fenders if a rack is also present.  TT owners know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what I am talking about - at least if you have an earlier model.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6.  Wider gear range - or at least more granny gears:  The 17-92
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gear-inch range barely cuts it at times.  I don't race, but I spin out at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around 27-28mph going downhill.  At the low end, some of the hills around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here are real killers.  The GTC has a 3x hub that is pretty nice, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not going to sink that much cash into the TT at this point.  Give it to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me as an option on a new trike and I won't squeal so much.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 7.  Less twitchy steering.  When I hit 35mph it gets squirrely; at 40 it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is terrifying.  And that is after aligning the wheels - a real pain, by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the way.  I never really have confidence that I have done a good job.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8.  Less brake steer: the hills again.  At high speeds, the brakes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require extraordinary skill to avoid swerving all over the road when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slowing.  (I know, I know.  I shouldn't be going that fast.  But let
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those among you without sin cast the first stone.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I would like to hear about your dissatisfactions or trikes you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have used that take care of some of these problems.  Or maybe you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the perfect trike already?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>Hey,
      Sounds to me like you need an ICE &quot;T&quot; :-)

I have a Trice Explorer .... earlier relative of the &quot;T&quot;.

First of all  ICE give you a customer service second to none.

Second, they ain't cheap but how often are you going to buy a trike
... I have had mine for 10 years now and I don't expect to get another.  Mind 
you, David Whitman's Velomobile makes me drool.

The steering on the Explorer is great .. I have descended Hecker Pass (towards 
Gilroy .. nice surface, sweeping bends)  at over 50 mph with no problems.

The Explorer has no brake steer and will pull up straight with only one front 
brake.

My Explorer has the SRAM Dual Drive which ICE does not supply any more. 
I have a 12-36 rear cassette and a 44-34-22 front triple on a 155mm crank 
which gives me a range of 22*20/36 at the bottom and 44*20/12 for the top ... 
about 12&quot;-74&quot;.  Being an Old Fart I find the top is sufficient .. if I am going 
that fast I dont pedal :-) and the bottom gets me up most hills.  With the 
dual drive the range goes from 9-100. I have the bar-end type gear changers( 
wouldn't change these for the worlds) and Hope hydraulic disc brakes ... if I 
do an emergency stop (like I just noticed the traffic lights are red) I can bury 
the front chainring in the asphalt.

I am sure you can get a dual drive rear wheel but you may have to get it made 
specially.  The &quot;T&quot; folds and you can get various quick release goodies which 
make folding a snap but of course with the SRAM drive you cannot QR the rear 
wheel.

You can get a fancy rack with the &quot;T&quot; and all-round fenders.  The seat angle 
is adjustable !! 

In the 10 years I have had my trike (16000 miles), I have changed out the rear 
cluster twice because of wear, the crankset once to change to 155mm from 170mm 
(spin, spin), the chain (all 2.5 standard chains ) twice (wear and new drive 
train), the front chainrings once (wear), the front and rear idlers once and 
the trackrod ends once (at 4k miles ... they were worn out .. the new ones 
have no perceptable wear after a further 12K miles) .. oh and three sets of 
tires.  All told I have spent about $1000 in 10 years .. $100 a year ain't 
bad.
