Get your machinist buddy to make you a dedicated tube bender.  CrMo
doesn't bend willingly.  (hell we pay extra for just that trait), and
I have broken light duty commercial benders trying.  You will need the
bender for the seat frame bits, and the handlebars.  On my bikes, it
was all 3/4&quot; od, and a common radius (this is pre ergo seat), so I
turned up a grooved disk from aluminum.

I used the lathe to get the bend diameter, and a V groove to deal with
most of the material, followed by a rotary table, and a ball endmill
to get a real half circle groove.  I already had a center hole, and
an additional pair of holes on a radial line (its how I mounted it to
the rotary table).  The center hole mounted the bending shoe, the
other two holes, a steel strap to hold the tubing down, and which also
served as a lug to hold the thing in my bench vise.  (my shop has yet
to emerge from my last move, so I can't provide a picture)
