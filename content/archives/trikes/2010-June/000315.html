<PRE>I have also been wondering if I was ejected from the list.  Almost no posts
for a few months.  I was heavily involved with the list while choosing my
TT3.4 and have been mostly lurking ever since.

Interesting stuff.  It seems like gearing, steering and braking are the
common interests - the last two of occasionally life-saving importance.  One
responder (who chose to remain anonymous) told me about becoming airborne at
high speed and heading toward a truck.  He is a big fan of brake steer which
saved him after landing.  I just want to more easily negotiate downhill
curves and slow down when I am going too fast without swerving into oncoming
traffic.

I seem to remember Trice marketing the Ts, but their website doesn't refer
to them at all.  Just Adventure, Sprint and Vortex.  All of them are
folding.  Does that mean that these are all progeny of the Ts?  They are
certainly cheaper than I remember.  What happened to the old rigid frame
models?  Too expensive to sell?  There must have been some compromises made
to bring the price down so much.  Any ideas?

I know that GS has great engineering.  My wife's GS-GTC is certainly a
beauty at roughly twice the price of my TT3.4.   GS also has some relatively
inexpensive folders, but still stocks rigid frame trikes.  I really don't
need the folding feature - especially if there are compromises that result.
