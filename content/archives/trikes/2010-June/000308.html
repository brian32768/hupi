<PRE>I agree. I miss this list.

&gt;<i> Well, my homebuilt had nice steady steering and no brake steer.  The handgrip travel was about 4X greater than is common on trikes for the same amount of turning.  I used long levers, and a large turning circle.  I made U-turns and T-turns the same as I would in a car.  Both front brakes worked from the same handgrip, and the steering had 1/2&quot; positive scrub radius with a bit of toe-in.

</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I used to get a dozen messages a day from lists like this.  Has everybody moved to Facebook?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although my TerraTrike 3.4 has served me well for seven years, I have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7-year itch.  There are a few features or options I would like to have that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weren't available when I snagged the TT.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In no particular order, here are some features lacking from the TT.  (I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already added some to my TT, but would like them straight out of the new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trike box.)  Please add to this list your own pet gripes.  By the time this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread dies I hope something will take shape that is commercially available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.  Fixed seat: Mine is set at about the same standard angle as my wife's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GTC and never gets reset.  And it creaks and wobbles from old age - the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trike, that is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.  Sturdy idlers:  Those original equipment delrins lasted about 2 weeks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Got the TerraCycle versions and no problems since.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.  Easy to remove front wheels:  The TT takes a 24mm wrench.  I much prefer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the GTC simple hex removal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4.  Built-in mounting options: I like the GS post system, for example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5.  Easier-to-mount fenders if a rack is also present.  TT owners know what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am talking about - at least if you have an earlier model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6.  Wider gear range - or at least more granny gears:  The 17-92 gear-inch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> range barely cuts it at times.  I don't race, but I spin out at around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 27-28mph going downhill.  At the low end, some of the hills around here are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> real killers.  The GTC has a 3x hub that is pretty nice, but I'm not going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to sink that much cash into the TT at this point.  Give it to me as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option on a new trike and I won't squeal so much.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7.  Less twitchy steering.  When I hit 35mph it gets squirrely; at 40 it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terrifying.  And that is after aligning the wheels - a real pain, by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way.  I never really have confidence that I have done a good job.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 8.  Less brake steer: the hills again.  At high speeds, the brakes require
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extraordinary skill to avoid swerving all over the road when slowing.  (I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know, I know.  I shouldn't be going that fast.  But let those among you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without sin cast the first stone.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I would like to hear about your dissatisfactions or trikes you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used that take care of some of these problems.  Or maybe you have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perfect trike already?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Larry
