<PRE> Hi Bill

I was one of those who commented on Bionx a while back.  I have the 350W
unit on a TT3.6 for my wife -- we have had it about 2 years now..  Sent it
back to the dealer many times. Many components have been replaced. The
problems was that it would lock-out under load and take 5 to 10 minutes to
recover.  Part of the problem no doubt was that my wife would forget to
gear-down on hills -- we do have hills in the Piedmont section of NC.
Anyway, it is much better now, due to my wife learning what can cause an
overload and likely some updated components.
She is  satisfied now, and would not want to be without it.  It does add a
lot of weight to the trike.
All of my communication was with the dealer.  I have sent e-mails to Bionx
in the past and they went into their trash folder -- I guess.
The dealer is in Salt Lake City (I am in NC) -- they had the best price at
the time.  The dealer really did try to help though they seemed to be slow
to respond at times.  Recommend you use a local dealer if possible.
