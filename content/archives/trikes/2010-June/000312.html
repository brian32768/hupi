<PRE>Hi Elmo,

It sounds like you have a good start, with a set of Greenspeed plans, wheels, brakes and some building experience.  Why do you think it's &quot;not suitable&quot;?

Thunderbolt plans are still available, for free or Spitfire, can be bought, but I find I spend almost as much time creating my own plans, as I do building.

Subject: [trikes] New Trike Build

My name is Elmo Butler and I am in Natchez, Mississippi. I will turn 64 this
year and have rode bikes for a lot of years.

I have never ridden a trike since childhood and think now is the time for a
serious trike.

I am starting my second attempt to build a trike. Back in 1998 I ordered a
set of plans from Greenspeed.

Started the build, acquired wheels and tires. SA drum brakes on the front
with a caliper on the rear for 

parking and drag on hills. 

            I then got into building an TourEasy from a pile of 4130 and
Henry James lugs. A lot of things happened

and the trike just sat there. Now I am looking at the frame and it is not
suitable. So I am going to build a new 

frame from 4130 chromo. I have a friend who is a good machinest and he is
giong to build my spindles and axels for me.

            Any suggestions are welcome.

            Elmo
