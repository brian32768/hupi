<PRE>Although my TerraTrike 3.4 has served me well for seven years, I have the
7-year itch.  There are a few features or options I would like to have that
weren't available when I snagged the TT.

In no particular order, here are some features lacking from the TT.  (I have
already added some to my TT, but would like them straight out of the new
trike box.)  Please add to this list your own pet gripes.  By the time this
thread dies I hope something will take shape that is commercially available.

1.  Fixed seat: Mine is set at about the same standard angle as my wife's
GTC and never gets reset.  And it creaks and wobbles from old age - the
trike, that is.

2.  Sturdy idlers:  Those original equipment delrins lasted about 2 weeks.
Got the TerraCycle versions and no problems since.

3.  Easy to remove front wheels:  The TT takes a 24mm wrench.  I much prefer
the GTC simple hex removal.

4.  Built-in mounting options: I like the GS post system, for example.

5.  Easier-to-mount fenders if a rack is also present.  TT owners know what
I am talking about - at least if you have an earlier model.

6.  Wider gear range - or at least more granny gears:  The 17-92 gear-inch
range barely cuts it at times.  I don't race, but I spin out at around
27-28mph going downhill.  At the low end, some of the hills around here are
real killers.  The GTC has a 3x hub that is pretty nice, but I'm not going
to sink that much cash into the TT at this point.  Give it to me as an
option on a new trike and I won't squeal so much.

7.  Less twitchy steering.  When I hit 35mph it gets squirrely; at 40 it is
terrifying.  And that is after aligning the wheels - a real pain, by the
way.  I never really have confidence that I have done a good job.

8.  Less brake steer: the hills again.  At high speeds, the brakes require
extraordinary skill to avoid swerving all over the road when slowing.  (I
know, I know.  I shouldn't be going that fast.  But let those among you
without sin cast the first stone.)

Anyway, I would like to hear about your dissatisfactions or trikes you have
used that take care of some of these problems.  Or maybe you have the
perfect trike already?

Thanks,
Larry
