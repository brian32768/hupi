<PRE>I don't have a gripe list as such, but comments below, based on my 
current ride and others less fortunate :-)

&gt;<i> Although my TerraTrike 3.4 has served me well for seven years, I have the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In no particular order, here are some features lacking from the TT.  (I have
</I>&gt;<i> already added some to my TT, but would like them straight out of the new
</I>&gt;<i> trike box.)  Please add to this list your own pet gripes.  By the time this
</I>&gt;<i> thread dies I hope something will take shape that is commercially available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Fixed seat: Mine is set at about the same standard angle as my wife's
</I>&gt;<i> GTC and never gets reset.  And it creaks and wobbles from old age - the
</I>&gt;<i> trike, that is.
</I>
Would sometimes like an adjustable seat. Must build that on-the-fly 
adjustable linkage one day...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Sturdy idlers:  Those original equipment delrins lasted about 2 weeks.
</I>&gt;<i> Got the TerraCycle versions and no problems since.
</I>
Greenspeed make good ones. Lacking a lathe, I have always bought theirs. 
They are silent and last for ever.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Easy to remove front wheels:  The TT takes a 24mm wrench.  I much prefer
</I>&gt;<i> the GTC simple hex removal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.  Built-in mounting options: I like the GS post system, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5.  Easier-to-mount fenders if a rack is also present.  TT owners know what
</I>&gt;<i> I am talking about - at least if you have an earlier model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6.  Wider gear range - or at least more granny gears:  The 17-92 gear-inch
</I>&gt;<i> range barely cuts it at times.  I don't race, but I spin out at around
</I>&gt;<i> 27-28mph going downhill.  At the low end, some of the hills around here are
</I>&gt;<i> real killers.  The GTC has a 3x hub that is pretty nice, but I'm not going
</I>&gt;<i> to sink that much cash into the TT at this point.  Give it to me as an
</I>&gt;<i> option on a new trike and I won't squeal so much.
</I>
At least you can easily retrofit more gearing - it's only money :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7.  Less twitchy steering.  When I hit 35mph it gets squirrely; at 40 it is
</I>&gt;<i> terrifying.  And that is after aligning the wheels - a real pain, by the
</I>&gt;<i> way.  I never really have confidence that I have done a good job.
</I>
Have you checked its geometry out in Peter Eland's steering spreadsheet? 
What might be happening is that the toe-out increases as you get away 
from straight-ahead. Also the next item may influence.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8.  Less brake steer: the hills again.  At high speeds, the brakes require
</I>&gt;<i> extraordinary skill to avoid swerving all over the road when slowing.  (I
</I>&gt;<i> know, I know.  I shouldn't be going that fast.  But let those among you
</I>&gt;<i> without sin cast the first stone.)
</I>
There's no excuse for brake and bump steer - the kingpins should, when 
projected, hit the ground almost directly in front of the contact patch 
with a trail of about 1.5-2&quot;. If you get that right, the trike will be 
stable at any speed and not give you any brown stains to the trousers. 
At over 70mph my present ride is quite uneventful to steer (wouldn't 
mind suspension at that speed tho..) Greenspeed geometry is for me the 
benchmark here (usual disclaimer applies)

Conversely, I've ridden some that had vertical kingpins. Scary... The 
Windcheetah is like that, and is only saved by having linked brakes, 
which must be kept carefully adjusted to avoid pulling to one side.
(My asbestos suit is close at hand for the inevitable WC backlash...)

Best,
G.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I would like to hear about your dissatisfactions or trikes you have
</I>&gt;<i> used that take care of some of these problems.  Or maybe you have the
</I>&gt;<i> perfect trike already?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
