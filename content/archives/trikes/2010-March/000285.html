<PRE>On my Greenspeed (20 inch 406 wheels) I used Comp Pools until 2008 - on 
the front the first set lasted 4,500 miles, the second set 4,750 miles 
and the third set 5,350 miles.  On the back I got 2,000 miles, 5,000 
miles, 3,700 miles and 1,900 miles (the lower mileages were retired due 
to BIG glass cuts).  I can no longer get Comp Pools so am currently 
using Schawlbe Marathons (the standard Marathon) and have about 2,000 
miles so far. The comp Pools are a nice tyre - I normally only got lots 
of punctures towards the end - where I live in NE England the urban 
roads and urban cycle tracks receive a regular top dressing of broken 
glass, so I wish I could get more Comp Pools.

On my Trice XXL (20 inch 406 wheels) I have used Schawlbe  Marathon 
Slicks (no longer made) - 3,000 and 4,000 miles for two front wheel 
sets, and 1,700, 2,300, 2,900 and 2,300 miles on the back - the largest 
mileages (front and back) was too far - I suffered far too many 
punctures for the last 500 miles or so but was away on a tour.  I then 
put some rubbish tyres on the front and the final Slick on the back and 
replaced them all with Greenspeed Scorchers the next summer before 
setting off on a tour to France - I suffered more punctures than the 
other 7 people on the tour put together - and the Scorchers were a very 
very (VERY) tight fit on the Trice rims - after 2,100 miles they were 
worn out (I suspect that the Trice Rims are slightly oversize to keep 
tires on, while the Greenspeed Scorcher tyres are slightly undersize to 
keep them on - in combination the result is a nightmare).  My next 
tyres were Schawlbe  Marathon Racers - these are a nice fast tyre and 
pretty good for punctures when new - I have had mileages of 3,800, 
2,400 and 2,000 (on all three wheels) from Racers.  Last summer I ran a 
set of Schawlbe Kojaks on  my XXL - these are very light and very fast 
tyres -I only had 1 puncture but they only lasted 1,400 miles and there 
was very little rubber (if any) left in the centre by then.  For the 
last 200 miles I have being using Schawlbe Marathon Supremes - these 
seem to be good, but too soon to say really.

On my Trice Micro (16 inch 3349 wheels), I started with Brompton tyres 
and took them off after 3,600 miles because I got fed up with the lack 
of grip - if approaching a road junction where I might have to stop, if 
it was wet it was advisable to start slowing down well in advance (half 
a mile or so) as the result of applying the brakes was that the wheels 
stopped rotating - no other effect at all on speed was apparent (may be 
a slight exaggeration ).  I then ran Schawlbe Stelvios on the front and 
a standard Schawlbe Marathon on the back - the Stelvios (a very thin 
tyre which are no longer made) gave mileages of 1,200, 1,300 and 1,100 
miles on the left wheel and 2,100 and 1,600 on the right wheel.  On the 
back the Marathons gave mileages of 2,400 and more than 1,300 (tyre 
transfered to my Brompton).  Since then I have being using Greenspeed 
Scorchers - unlike with the 406 tyres on my XXL, on my Micro there is 
no problem fitting them and I have not suffered excessive punctures - 
on the front I have had 3,100 miles from the first set - the second set 
is still in use with 1,900 miles so far..  On the back there are 
clearance problems - the gear mech is VERY close to the ground and to 
the tyre - I have destroyed two Scorchers - the first after a rear 
wheel puncture - I got about 1 mile before BIG BANG and the tyre failed 
- the gear mech had grounded after the first puncture and been bent, so 
in the lowest gear the mech was trying to run inside the tyre - not a 
good idea - and the second after a spoke broke and the wheel warped so 
the mech was just touching the tyre in low gear - and I had a faulty 
tyre as well (it failed on the left side-wall, so the gear mech 
definitely did not cause that - but was replaced by Greenspeed with no 
quibbles) - so cannot give a tyre life for the rear wheel yet.

What I did not say above is that the worst experience I have had for 
punctures was when I was using the Schawlbe Marathons on my Greenspeed 
- I got them in Belgium and used them for 1,100 miles in Belgium, 
Netherlands and England with no problems but when I spent six days on a 
cycle holiday in Shropshire cycling 300 miles, I had 16 punctures - and 
I had a further 4 puncture on the 250 mile ride home - whenever I could 
find the cause of a puncture, it was a thorn - the farmers in 
Shropshire were busy cutting their hedges and I suspect the 4 punctures 
on the way home were due to thorns which took a while longer to work 
their way through to the inner tube.

Tyre life and puncture numbers is very much down to where you ride - my 
worst tyres lives and (apart from the French trip and the Shropshire 
holiday - see above) most numerous punctures were on my Brompton when I 
worked - most days I used it for a train/cycle commute, cycling about 
20 miles a week - but most of that was along the quayside in Newcastle 
passing numerous pubs and the resultant broken glass - since I stopped 
working I have had hardly any punctures on my Brompton and tyres seem 
to last many times longer - but I rarely cycle along the quayside now.
