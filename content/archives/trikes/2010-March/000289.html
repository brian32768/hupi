<PRE>Thanks to everyone who responded to my tire inquiry. The book will be 
out in a few months!

No, seriously, I truly enjoyed reading the contributions -- all of them. 
Clearly, there were four contributing factors: 1) the roadway was full 
of detritus from the snow and the failure of the towns to clean the 
streets; (2) the right front tire was running right through the junk; 
(3) I had just pumped the tires up to 80 psi (failed to mention that . . 
. Sorry!) and (4) I had had no flats in over a year, so statistically my 
time was up.

Now that spring is in the air here in West Orange, N.J., maybe the towns 
will start sweeping the roads once more. Until then, I may just ride a 
bit farther out in the road, at least until a car is about to overtake 
me. Actually, since I alternate between my GTO and an upright racer, I 
may just ride the upright a bit more until the roads get cleaner.

But it hasn't been all that bad: look at all the practice I've gotten 
fixing flats. I don't even have to remove the wheel: just tip the trike 
over on its side, remove the tube, fix it or install a new one and push 
the tire back onto the rim.

Cheers,

Jules
