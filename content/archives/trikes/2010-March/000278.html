<PRE>I must be approaching a world-record: 3 flats on the same wheel in 3 
days, each discovered in the morning as I was about to go riding. The 
flats occurred at different points on the tube, and the holes were small 
enough not to have caused any loss of pressure during the ride. (No, 
there is not any glass in my garage!) Each time I removed the tire and 
carefully checked inside, to make sure that I had not picked up a piece 
of glass or some other sliver; and each time the inside of the tire was 
perfectly clean.

The suspect is the right front tire of my 8 year-old  Greenspeed GTO 
with its original Tioga Comp Pool tires (with (@ 7,000 miles) still on 
the front wheels. During all this time, I think I have had only a 
handful of flats, all but one on the right front. That makes sense, 
because that's the tire that is closest to the curb and therefore most 
likely to pick up the road detritus that lays in wait for unsuspecting 
cyclists.

Perhaps one reason for all these flats is that we have had a tremendous 
amount of snow here in North Jersey, and the roads -- especially the 
portion closest to the curb -- are probably filled with the junk that 
would otherwise be cleaned up by street sweepers. Anyone have any other 
explanation?

In any event, it's probably a good idea to buy some new tires. I have 
not found much in the way of reviews of different trike tires and wonder 
if any of you have strong feelings about one tire or the other? Like the 
new Scorchers.

Any comments will be welcomed.

Thanks,

Jules
</PRE>
