<PRE>Ah, a clue! The rocksalt used here sometimes has small quartz needles in it that go straight through bike tyres!
If your snow is only just clearing and leaving piles of the stuff around....

</I>&gt;<i> No, seriously, I truly enjoyed reading the contributions -- all of them. Clearly, there were four contributing factors: 1) the roadway was full of detritus from the snow and the failure of the towns to clean the streets; (2) the right front tire was running right through the junk; (3) I had just pumped the tires up to 80 psi (failed to mention that . . . Sorry!) and (4) I had had no flats in over a year, so statistically my time was up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now that spring is in the air here in West Orange, N.J., maybe the towns will start sweeping the roads once more. Until then, I may just ride a bit farther out in the road, at least until a car is about to overtake me. Actually, since I alternate between my GTO and an upright racer, I may just ride the upright a bit more until the roads get cleaner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it hasn't been all that bad: look at all the practice I've gotten fixing flats. I don't even have to remove the wheel: just tip the trike over on its side, remove the tube, fix it or install a new one and push the tire back onto the rim.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
