<PRE>Does this work regardless of scrub radius? - not sure; I've tried it only on
my current trike that runs negative scrub radius.

Have you verified the results with a coast-down test? - I haven't; I have
not had much luck with coast-down tests as an accurate and repeatable test.

On a smooth concrete surface like my workshop floor, physically moving the
disconnected wheel (by pulling or pushing on the wheel steer lever) to move
it away from its 'natural' steer direction takes lots of effort (and the
amount of effort would also depend on the castor being used), and when the
wheel is aimed at a direction different to its natural direction, rolling
resistance clearly and noticeably rises (the trike slows abruptly).  

Setting toe as described also reduces the sound that can be heard on some
surfaces when there is some wheel scrub caused by incorrect toe.


Regards,

Julian Edgar

Does this work regardless of scrub radius?   Have you verified the 
results with a coast-down test?

Thanks,
