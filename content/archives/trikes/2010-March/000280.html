Jules,

I have always felt that chance plays a large factor in the frequency of
flats.  I am sure many people change tire make and model because they get
two flats in close temporal proximity, where it was really just luck.  It is
in our nature to seek reasons and patterns even before we have sufficient
data to make valid decisions.

Given that everything I say has to be filtered through the knowledge that I
may be confusing coincidence with good statistical reasoning.

I believe that the curbside wheel gets more flats because there is more
trash there than towards the crown of the road.

I think wet roads cause more flats.  The theory here (not my own, but I keep
it under advisement) is that the water makes slicing cuts easier and glass
slivers can cause more damage before breaking up. This agrees with another
observation of mine that I can cut rubber with a blade more easily if I have
water present - it does seem to lubricate the blade so it cuts more smoothly
and quickly.

I have more flats in winter time.  I think the roads are dirtier for some
reason.

 I think I get more flats on trikes than on two wheelers.  But with trikes I
think it is harder to evade problems (not that I am very attentive).

How a tire is weighted makes a difference - I almost never flatted the front
tires of my BikeEs which are VERY lightly loaded.

Really thin tires don't get much use on my bikes.  I like fat tires.  But, I
like them to be soft and flexible.  I sometimes pump them up tight and other
times not.

(Lot's of variables and differing conditions to be making comparisons, eh?)

Also, I am very non-reactive to flats in terms of giving up on tires and
changing brands.  And I tend to ride on the same sorts of roads and
conditions most of the time.  Even so the occurrence of flats seems to
oscillate for no apparent reason - sometimes more, sometimes less.

How large and high quality is my sample (Mike's flats as a predictor for all
flats)?  I think I have had maybe a hundred in 10 years.    I remember a
time when I had a flat on every ride for five rides straight, a couple rides
had multiple flats.   A few of them were my fault for doing a poor job of
mounting them.  I don't keep a log so maybe my record keeping is
suspect.  How good is my memory?  I don't give it that much credit, but this
a topic that gets cogitated upon for hours on rides.

I like Comp Pools, Primo Comets, and Panaracer Pasela.  I would buy
Scorchers.  Kenda Kwest have been good to me.  I have tried a variety of
slicks, and city tires and have no particular beef with any of them.

I hate tires that are hard to mount.  That is probably the main reason why I
won't buy a tire a second time.  This is not an issue with Greenspeeds and
their nice rims.  The only rim I know of specifically designed to make
changing the tire easy.

I would take the cost of replacing a pretty new tire and spend it on patch
kits and tire irons I like.  A good pump like a Morph can't be beat.

&gt;<i> I must be approaching a world-record: 3 flats on the same wheel in 3 days,

i realize that the flats are only on one side but with 7000 miles that tire carcass has got to be getting a little worn.  i can't help but feel that those wear markers have long been passed.  i always replace when either the wear markers are passed or fabric starts to show.  of course when i see fabric i know how lucky i have been to that point.  

what is it about bent riders that we hate to spend money after the initial purchase.  i like to get tires once a year.  something about the smell of new rubber in the color black.
