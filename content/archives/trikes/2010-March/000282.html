<PRE>A few things no one has mentioned. 

Tyre changes can make quite a large difference to handling, especially in
steering response.  One of my trikes I built and set-up on one type of tyre,
and when I changed to another type of tyre the handling was quite twitchy -
so I went back to the first tyre brand and model. 

I think suspension massively reduces the chance of punctures - especially
pinch-flats. On my suspension machines I have only ever had one puncture,
and that includes running at times at 20 psi tyre pressures.


Regards,

Julian Edgar

Hello Jules

Another opinion.  When I got my GTO I was still recovering from a herniated
disc condition and found that a smooth as possible ride was needed.  I tried
Schwalbe, Big Apple, 60mm and have really liked these tires.  Probably have
4000 miles on these and the center tread is gone, but like you say, I have
just not wanted to spend the money to replace yet.  I have gotten a few
flats, but in every case what I dug out of the treads would have gone
through most tires.   I run these at a very low pressure ( I know Michael
Ross thinks I am a little crazy for this).  I started using 40psi and about
1 year ago decided to change to 30psi to see what would happen. Can't tell a
lot of change, but it does not seem to add perceptible rolling resistance --
but no real testing has been done.  Schwalbe indicates that the recommended
low pressure is 22psi.   These tires have a good grip -- it is even
difficult to push the trike sideways in the garage to get it out of the way.

Middle of last year I had to start riding my mtn bike since I broke a rib in
my back and the trike reclining position was too painful.  So decided to try
the Big Apple on the mtn bike.  Worked quite well.  I really liked the quiet
relative to knobby tires on asphalt.  I was running with 30psi.  I could
even do easy single track, but would occasionally lose traction on roots and
muddy areas where a knobby tire is really needed.

&gt;<i> Jules,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have always felt that chance plays a large factor in the frequency of
</I>&gt;<i> flats.  I am sure many people change tire make and model because they get
</I>&gt;<i> two flats in close temporal proximity, where it was really just luck.  It
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> in our nature to seek reasons and patterns even before we have sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> data to make valid decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that everything I say has to be filtered through the knowledge that
</I>I
&gt;<i> may be confusing coincidence with good statistical reasoning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that the curbside wheel gets more flats because there is more
</I>&gt;<i> trash there than towards the crown of the road.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think wet roads cause more flats.  The theory here (not my own, but I
</I>&gt;<i> keep
</I>&gt;<i> it under advisement) is that the water makes slicing cuts easier and glass
</I>&gt;<i> slivers can cause more damage before breaking up. This agrees with another
</I>&gt;<i> observation of mine that I can cut rubber with a blade more easily if I
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> water present - it does seem to lubricate the blade so it cuts more
</I>&gt;<i> smoothly
</I>&gt;<i> and quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have more flats in winter time.  I think the roads are dirtier for some
</I>&gt;<i> reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I think I get more flats on trikes than on two wheelers.  But with trikes
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> think it is harder to evade problems (not that I am very attentive).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How a tire is weighted makes a difference - I almost never flatted the
</I>&gt;<i> front
</I>&gt;<i> tires of my BikeEs which are VERY lightly loaded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Really thin tires don't get much use on my bikes.  I like fat tires.  But,
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> like them to be soft and flexible.  I sometimes pump them up tight and
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> times not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Lot's of variables and differing conditions to be making comparisons,
</I>eh?)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I am very non-reactive to flats in terms of giving up on tires and
</I>&gt;<i> changing brands.  And I tend to ride on the same sorts of roads and
</I>&gt;<i> conditions most of the time.  Even so the occurrence of flats seems to
</I>&gt;<i> oscillate for no apparent reason - sometimes more, sometimes less.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How large and high quality is my sample (Mike's flats as a predictor for
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> flats)?  I think I have had maybe a hundred in 10 years.    I remember a
</I>&gt;<i> time when I had a flat on every ride for five rides straight, a couple
</I>&gt;<i> rides
</I>&gt;<i> had multiple flats.   A few of them were my fault for doing a poor job of
</I>&gt;<i> mounting them.  I don't keep a log so maybe my record keeping is
</I>&gt;<i> suspect.  How good is my memory?  I don't give it that much credit, but
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> a topic that gets cogitated upon for hours on rides.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like Comp Pools, Primo Comets, and Panaracer Pasela.  I would buy
</I>&gt;<i> Scorchers.  Kenda Kwest have been good to me.  I have tried a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> slicks, and city tires and have no particular beef with any of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hate tires that are hard to mount.  That is probably the main reason why
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> won't buy a tire a second time.  This is not an issue with Greenspeeds and
</I>&gt;<i> their nice rims.  The only rim I know of specifically designed to make
</I>&gt;<i> changing the tire easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would take the cost of replacing a pretty new tire and spend it on patch
</I>&gt;<i> kits and tire irons I like.  A good pump like a Morph can't be beat.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I must be approaching a world-record: 3 flats on the same wheel in 3
</I>&gt;<i> days,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each discovered in the morning as I was about to go riding. The flats
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; occurred at different points on the tube, and the holes were small
</I>enough
&gt;<i> &gt; not to have caused any loss of pressure during the ride. (No, there is
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any glass in my garage!) Each time I removed the tire and carefully
</I>&gt;<i> checked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inside, to make sure that I had not picked up a piece of glass or some
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sliver; and each time the inside of the tire was perfectly clean.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The suspect is the right front tire of my 8 year-old  Greenspeed GTO
</I>with
&gt;<i> &gt; its original Tioga Comp Pool tires (with (@ 7,000 miles) still on the
</I>&gt;<i> front
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wheels. During all this time, I think I have had only a handful of
</I>flats,
&gt;<i> &gt; all but one on the right front. That makes sense, because that's the
</I>tire
&gt;<i> &gt; that is closest to the curb and therefore most likely to pick up the
</I>road
&gt;<i> &gt; detritus that lays in wait for unsuspecting cyclists.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps one reason for all these flats is that we have had a tremendous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amount of snow here in North Jersey, and the roads -- especially the
</I>&gt;<i> portion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; closest to the curb -- are probably filled with the junk that would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; otherwise be cleaned up by street sweepers. Anyone have any other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explanation?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In any event, it's probably a good idea to buy some new tires. I have
</I>not
&gt;<i> &gt; found much in the way of reviews of different trike tires and wonder if
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of you have strong feelings about one tire or the other? Like the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scorchers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any comments will be welcomed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
