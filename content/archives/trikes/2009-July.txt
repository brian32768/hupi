Mr Sims:
It's not an apples to oranges comparison, both designs are easily run
through most major analytical dynamics packages. Since that package will
output the same parameters for both designs they're easy to compare on
the same merits. You know that. Saying that it's "apples to oranges"
only confuses the consumers and further hampers the industry. I'd like
if you stopped doing that. Also, Rider comfort is a function of the
seat, not the bike. When comparing two designs you place them on equal
footing, meaning you remove the rider from the equation in this
instance.

Fran:
Delta trikes tend to have a high CoG, combined with having less traction
up front this means they handle like an American SUV. Tadpole trikes
have a lower CoG, more traction for turning, and a better steering
geometry. Surely your race course has a turn in it?

Or maybe you'd notice that tadpole designs tend to be more recumbent,
reducing frontal area and improving Cd, which helps both top speed and
cruising calorie burn.

Hey, while I'm listing things, How about the fact that the dual front
brakes on a tadpole get the brake bias to a realistic area for safe use.

If you already own a delta, current technology may not have improved
enough since your last purchase to warrant the expenditure for a new
bike, However if it's been a few years I would definitely direct you to
a tadpole model, as delta models have no place in trike racing.

I think you could argue that in machines without suspension wheel size &
tire pressure both have significant effects on ride quality (more so
even than on suspended machines).

Of course, if you're riding on a smooth flat surface (it's nice to
dream) then it all comes down to the ergonomics of the seat and more
generally the seating position including crank height, control
positioning, etc.

Both assumptions seems a bit simplistic to me.

A tadpole will be more stable in a high speed or sharp turn.  The  presence 
of a wheel in the vector of the original path accounts for  it.

Then to confuse the issue further we have the leaning deltas of the 
likes of 25hz and Ian Sims  which are by all accounts both fast and 
stable. As to comfort I can't say.

In terms of max cornering power, there is no need for any confusion at all.
A simple skidpan test reveals all, and quantifies it too!

Well, in theory that might be the case, but with the revival of some of the 
tilting delta designs, that is pretty much no longer the case.  I made a 
narrow track FWD tilting delta and it's teh fastest trike I've ever ridden 
or raced, by far.  The tilting deltas corner like a 2 wheeler with none of 
the loss associated with hard cornering on a tadpole.  They also have none 
of the stability concerns of standard deltas, and finally, with a 25? seat 
angle and the rear wheels tucked in behind the seat for maximum aero 
benefit, they have a better aero profile than any conventional delta or 
tadpole out there.
My Max with a 17" track:
http://fleettrikes.com/black%20max%20moorseville%2009.jpg

Dennis Grelk took his FWD lowracer and made a bolt on tilting rear end for 
it.  His is very fast too.
http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/racing2009/northbrook-kenosha/cortez/DSCF5679.jpg
His first bolt on rear end (just slips into the dropouts) a little smaller 
and simpler than the bolt-on I made for my python.
http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/racing2009/northbrook-kenosha/glatch/TrikeTiltMech.jpg
Then he made a smaller, neater one still with a 10.25" track
http://picasaweb.google.com/neverest1979/FordHumanPoweredSpeedChallenge09#5360713850352116658

Bram Smit of Fast FWD NL fame took his Munzo FWD lowracer and added a 
tilting rear end to it and it'll be another slick new addition to the HPRA 
races starting Manchester, hopefully.
http://www.fastfwd.nl/index.php?id=57

There's also the Jetrike but I don't know if he's further developed it or 
was looking at performance aspects, but there's no reason for it not to 
handle as well as the others.
www.jetrike.com

Finally, there's Jensen from Southern Ontario with another style of titler 
with a very simple tilting rear end mechnism.

All three lined up for the mass start 1 hour at the Ford event in MI.

Thanks to Paul Sims for his inspiration with the original design from 8 or 9 
years ago.  It's an awaesome design that removes most of the negative 
aspects of tapoles and deltas and moves their speed almost to that of a two 
wheeled lowracer and makes them stick in the corners better than a bike.  I 
think if Greenspeed started making them for people, especially the trike 
races in Australia, they'd tear up the track.

You obviously need to stay on top of news (actually it's old news now) about 
the two new delta trikes from GS and RANs.  They are nothing like the 
previous versions of commercial deltas.  All your "advice" amounts to is 
just bad advice and an obvious prejudice against deltas based on outdated 
information for both performance AND braking.

sorry to break someone's bubble but deltas are meant for racing.  that is the right delta.  i have been riding a delta who's design is over 15 years old.  it races just fine; and ian know what it is.  a lot of diamond frames and two wheel bents have seen it in their rear view mirrors and then found themselves suddenly trying to follow it down the road.  i think we are hearing from some of the bentrider on line folks.  the ones who specialize in dwr; drive way racing!!

you ride a delta that is designed to race?? And what make and model is it? I would love to see some pictures  of it.

Possibly a Baccura ?

Thanks for all links about leaning deltas. However they seem more suitable for racing than for everyday use or as "touring truck". My main concern is an every day vehicle that is practical but at the same time not too slow or heavy and that is not too heavy to pedal on soft ground. It is really hard to beat an ordinary upright bike in that respect.

How is the riding qualities? Does it tip over when you are standing still, or how do you control the tilting? If it behaves like a two-wheeler, what is the benefit of a tilting delta? Isn't riding a two-wheeler just the same but with lower weight?

They might seem like they are more suitable for racing, but that's only for 
people who have never ridden them.  I race, commute, do casual rides, 
charity events and ultra rides on it.  The only thing I haven't tried is 
off-road.  With a tilt lock, the trike stays upright on it's own and andhas 
better performance in pretty much every area than any other delta or tadpole 
I've ever ridden.

I've seen them with just a parallelogram linkage, which makes them 
handle just like a bike when unlocked. The advantage over a bike is that 
you can lock it when riding slowly - some have a brake disc that lets 
you lock it in any position for cambered roads etc.

But you can also make a "rising" linkage, which means the trike falls 
towards the centre and tends to stay upright. Too much rise is bad 
though because you have to force it into a corner by leaning strongly 
and/or countersteering. I have a teacher friend here in Qld who has had 
his school build a rising leaning delta for Pedal Prix, and he has 
reported it handles very nicely (I've not ridden it yet). It rises for 
the first few degrees of lean from the vertical, and then falls in the 
normal parallelogram fashion. It's a glass monocoque, and faired quite 
tightly so there's no real ability to lean it by moving your body weight.

So many interesting things to build, so little time (I've invested a lot 
of time in a conventional tad with fairing now - funny to describe it as 
conventional :-)
