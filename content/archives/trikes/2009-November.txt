Guys,
A few years ago, I bought Rick's trike plans ( and the up-date). Downloaded them on my pc , had intended to print someday.
Pc crashed, wrote to Rick and explained what happened. Asked for free copy of them. 

HE NEVER REPLIED!

Resent same letter last week, still NO REPLY!

Have any of you been in touch with him? Is he still kicking? Who owns the company now? How do I get in touch for an answer?


Sincerely,      Leo Roderick Guajardo, 11                     in Dallas.

Hellbent or whatever Rick called his company has been out of business  
for several years. I saw Rick earlier this year at the HPV races at  
Hellyer Velodrome in San Jose, CA. He moved from Texas back to  
California. Rick occasionally posts to the forum on  
www.bentrideronline.com. You could do a search there and track him down.

Leo,

Sorry about the communication problem.  If anyone wishes to email me, do so
at trikesrcool at yahoo.com or rhorwitz at hellbentcycles.com. It's been
several years since I've participated in the IHPVA list, so I don't monitor
this venue frequently. I try to respond to all my emails, but sometimes
these messages can get caught in my spam filter and I never see them.

Hellbent Cycle Works is still alive and well, but Hellbent Cycles Inc has
been dissolved.  At the moment, I sell only recumbent trike plans and have
recently released the Mk III plans that add the last features found on the
Spitfire, including a larger 26" rear wheel, segmented frame and red lines
to the plans for constructing it out of steel.  I have delegated my parts
and supplies to Frank Takacs at http://www.gottrikes.com, as Frank is an
excellent machinist and is also an accomplished Designer/Engineer as well.  


Best regards,
 

Rickey M. Horwitz

RE: Hellbent/Horwitz plans

I'll vouch for Rickey's fast and courteous response to a recent query I 
had. Sorry I missed the original post on the subject from Leo, but I 
think my spam filter ate that one.

While I haven't yet bought anything through Frank Takacs, I've had some 
correspondence with him, and he seems to be friendly, open about 
answering questions, and honest about what he can and can't provide.

Ken Olthoff - happy Hellbent plan customer

My tour was 304 miles. Just 8 miles from  Natchez(another state) 39 days counting about 6 rain days and then 7.5 hours by car. I had to cut my trip short as my son in law is drawing his lasts breaths as I write this. His kidneys are already shutting down. He lives next door to me and is dying from pancreatic cancer. He is only about 58 and I don't think it has sunk in yet for me. I got home yesterday afternoon after driving a U Haul van with my trike and trailer in it for 7.5 hours. I would rather pedal for 39 days. I was in Ferriday La and was to get my bottom bracket fixed yesterday in Natchez but instead had to come home. 
 
I thought I would be sleeping in my tent every night but finally got smarter and have slept on church pews, on the floor of a preachers office, in the large fellowship buildings at Baptist churches, behind churches in my tent, on a front porch in pouring rain for 2 days, in the woods 2 days hiding in pouring rain, in a church members house, in an old parsonage that is now a youth building, in the yard of a drunk after being refused the yard of an Assembly of God church and 2 churches put me up in motels,In a little apartment like house next to a church.. When one fellow found out why I was riding he paid for me to stay in an rv park in the rv section. My only campground with the elite. I did stay in a Natl forest but it was on the hiway and I was the only one there.  I am going around to different Baptist churches and asking if I can give my testimony. Now I am in my warm bed until at least the 10th of Dec. If my sons test results for colon cancer come back positive I guess I will stay here and take care of him and my grandson. I hope its not because I can be ready to roll in a matter of minutes. I will go thru my stuff and change some out and add some and had just sent some home. I almost beat it home.
 
My bottom bracket is slightly loose or whatever. It skips a space or bumps or whatever you call it. I don't know how to fix it so will have to go to a bike shop and let them. Is it hard to do or need special tools? I could try and save me some $$. I spent it all on a van to come home. Over $450. Ohhhhhh that is so painful. I will have to get back too so will spend more in a couple week. Might have to get a job on the road to support my habit. I also had all the spokes in 1 wheel come loose at the same time and that stopped me in my tracks when I found out. After sitting on the hiway from 9:30 am til 3 pm help finally arrived. I was so glad to see them too. 
 
I have been on hwy 84 just 80 miles or so  east of Waco Tx since I started this trip. I have stayed on this road all the way. Driving home I am glad I didn't take the route I had thought about as the roads are so sorry. 
 
Kelly, yes the P-style (female pee cup) is an absolute necessity. That is the best thing ever invented for us ladies to go potty on the road. 
 
I can't wait to get back out on the road. I could live there forever if I had someone to talk to at the end of the day. Being alone all the time is not my thing. I really love this riding tho. 
 
I will probably some time in the future write a better version of this trip but right now its time to go start cooking for tomorrow. Happy Thanksgiving to all. Fran

James,

Yes! Please do! Thank you! Have you made any attempts at one? Personally, I feel plans are 'over' engineered. Doubt I would keep it exactly as per plans, feel I would cut corners , ...'if' I ever try it. Just feel that as a "registered purchaser", I should have a copy of said plans.

I presently have three trikes now:
1. Red "SideWinder", now wish to sell it;
2. Green "Actionbenttrike", adjusted for 'child-size' ladyfriend;
3. Orange "DragonFlyer", ride most of the time;
4, several other frames in various stages of completeness, I work in spurts, etc.
Not much fun working alone, not found anyone close by.
Not sure if you kept tract of my attempt to buy Rick's company on this list. Found three Texans (two retired welders)who expressed interests, another one in Iowa. Never came to fruition. 

Same results with defunct "DragonFlyer". 

Again,   TNX!

Sincerely,      Lrod, 11            in Dallas

My dau was in a car wreck and had surgery in Sept for a torn rotator cuff in her shoulder. She has been in a lot pain for a couple years with this. She ended it all last night . She was an RN with a masters degree. Such a waste of a life. I am numb and have a funeral for my son in law Thur. who died from pancreatic cancer. I am sure I will be back riding when life gets back to normal. Hmmmm wonder what normal is. Fran
