the remaining physical assets have been sold.

What is my lowest gear inch with a Rohloff hub and a 17 tooth sprocket and a Schlumph Mountain drive with I think a 42 inch chain ring. Please don't send me somewhere to figure it out because I don't know how. Tried that already. 

Also with a speed drive. I don't have the chain ring size but is is small. Sorry I know that doesn't help. Fran

Rohloff		Low	High	Low	High
Schlumpf	Low	Low	High	High
========	===	====	===	====
Mountain	5.5	29.0	13.8	72.5
Speed		13.8	72.5	22.7	119.6
Speed2		13.8	72.5	34.5	181.22


The formula is:
GearInches = Chainring x Schlumpf / Sprocket x Rohloff x WheelDiameter

Where	Chainring =	42
	Schlumpf =	1 / 2.5		(mountain low)
	Schlumpf =	1 / 1		(mountain high)
	Schlumpf =	1 / 1		(speed low)
	Schlumpf =	1.65 / 1	(speed high)
	Schlumpf =	1 / 1		(speed2 low)
	Schlumpf =	2.5 / 1		(speed2 high)
	Sprocket =	17
	Roholff = 	.279		(low)
	Roholff = 	1.467		(low)
	WheelDiameter	20		(or 26 if you have one of those)

For the metric "meters of development", change WheelDiameter to
WheelCircumference which would then be 20 x .0254 x pi, which is 20 x
.0254 3.14 which is 1.5959.

>From my experience, the speed drive I with a 40 tooth chainring and a 17
tooth sprocket gave a decent range.  I have been tempted to get a speed
drive II, but can't quite justify it until my speed drive I just wears
out.  At that point, I may put in an even smaller chainring to extend
the low end.  We were able to tow 3/4 tonne with tandem cranks out of
phase at about 15 gear inches.

There are warnings about not going below a certain combined ratio due to
the possibility of breaking the Rohloff internal plastic overtorque
bushings, but considering your situation, I think that will be not a
concern.


As an update, I hadn't posted this to the list back in May...  We bought
a new stackable front-loading washer/dryer set and I got a bit impatient
with their delivery schedule, so I just went to get them myself.  :)
This load was 1/3 of the design load for the trailer (so 360 pounds) and
was easier than it looks, even in solo rather than tandem.
	http://tricolour.net/photos//2010/05/18/organ-trailer.html
I only had to use the 13 gear inch lowest gear once on that 9km haul and
that was on a fairly steep hill up a bridge (maybe 8%?).

For those who are newer to the list, here are the original articles
about the trike and the trailer:

Hi Fran,

There are new 'SLX' cassettes out this year that run 11-36t. You probably have 11-30 or so. Not sure how many other parts you'll need to swap out. Mick has photos of the cogs on his Facebook page.

  Fran,
check with your local bike shop, you should be able to change out the 
rear cassette completely with one that is lower over all.
On my first trike when i had to change mine out i actually went a bit 
higher for faster speeds.

It is often cheaper and easier to change the rings up front to up or down the gear ranges - within the limits of what will work with your chainset and vehicle.
Changing the sprockets at the back is usually the easier option if you want to change the size of the steps between a run of adjacent gears.
But, of course, both can be changed to have the other effect.

Hi Rob, The largest rear cog is a 26. If I had a 30 or more it would be perfect. I did swap out a couple on my Lightfootcycle Greenway and it worked out ok. I didn't know if I could do the same with this. I am leaving town next week with a couple trikes and bikes so don't know if I will have time to mess with it but would at some time. 
 
I don't go to face book so not sure how to see Micks page. Fran

Keep in mind you may well need to add a section to the chain as well if
adding larger cogs.

Hi Fran,
        The standard gearing on the GT3 is 52/42/30 on the front, and 9/26 on the rear.

This gives a range of 20 to 98 inches with the 16 x 1 1/2" rear wheel which has a diameter of 17".

Or 19 to 95 with the early 16" x 1 3/8" rear tyre which had a diameter of 16.5"

The 9/26 cassette is a Shimano Capreo cassette, which is made esp. for bikes with small wheels, and will only
fit a special Capreo hub, or a special hub made to fit the Capreo cassette.

The Capreo cassette has a number of advantages over the standard hub, as fitted say to the GT1, and many other
bikes and trikes, on which the smallest cog that can be fitted is a 11t.

The main one is that it gives a wider gear range, for the number of teeth difference between the largest and
smallest cog.

That is it has a 26/9 x 100 = 289% for a 17 tooth difference. Whereas a common 11/28 cassette will only give a
28/11 x 100 = 256% for a 17 tooth difference. This is important with a small wheel trike, as to use the full
range of gears from one extreme to the other, i.e. small to small and large to large one can use a mid cage
derailleur instead of long cage, if you want to have the chain well clear of the road.

The 9/26 cassette is the only one currently available for the Capreo hub, thus the easiest way of providing
lower gears, is to switch the "road" 52/42/30 triple cranks for a "MTB" 44/32/22 crank set, as we do with our
small frame GT3s.

This will give you 14 to 83 inches, with a wider overall range of 593%, V 490% for the standard gearing.

It is also possible to swap out the rear wheel for one with a standard hub which will take say a 11/34
cassette, but this will require a long cage rear derailleur to use all gear combinations, which could give you
ground clearance problems on unmade roads, or if you retain the standard mid-cage rear derailleur, you will
need to remember not to use combinations like small to small, which may allow the chain to drag on the ground,
or large to large, if the chain is adjusted to tight, when you could damage the rear derailleur.

It is also possible to change some of the cogs on the Capreo cassette for larger ones to give you lower gears,
but this has the same disadvantages as the swapping the rear hub, and using a 11/30, 11/32, or 11/34.

If you were to use a 32 t rear cog with the 52/42/32 crank set, then you lowest gear would only be 
17 inches, so in my opinion the easiest way of getting lower gears is the 44/32/22 crankset.

Yet another way is to change the rear wheel for one with a SRAM DualDrive hub. With an 11/28 cassette, and the
standard 52/42/30 crankset this would give you much wider gear range of 14 to 107, but no lower than the
44/32/22 crankset option.

Some people have also fitted the German Rohloff 14 speed rear hub and the Schulmpf mountain drive.
This gives a very wide range of say 9 to 115 inches with our standard 13/60 gearing. However you will suffer a
small power loss, in the lower gears, of about 10%. For some people this does not matter, whereas others find
it unacceptable. Thus IMO each rider should carefully consider the options before changing....

I would like lower gears on my GT3 and was wondering if the largest cog in the rear could be replaced by a
larger one without any problems??? Thanks Fran

Yeah, should have said - i am using a 9-30 custom cassette on a Capreo hub but I only have a single front chainring and a mountain drive so I don't need the big take up that Ian suggests you'd need with the 11-30. As far as the efficiency goes, I've got that machine very carefully set up so most of my riding is in the 'efficient' direct drive of the MD.

Oh, and if you are rebuilding a Capreo, unless you have access to clever tech, you have to use the 9t & 10t small bits because the cassette body is stepped only taking the donor 'deore' type parts for, I think, the inner 7 sprockets. 

As Ian says there are a lot of variations and it depends what you are trying to achieve and what your budget is.

I have an early Trice Micro which uses the same 16 inch wheel as the 
GT3 - it has a standard hub with 11 to 32 cassette, 52 and 40 teeth 
chainwheels and a Speed-drive, giving gears from 17 inches to 126 
inches, and uses a Sram medium cage gear mech.  The clearance below the 
rear gear mech in some gears is minimal - a puncture in the rear wheel 
can mean the clearance is negative (I have replaced the rear mech once 
already as the original was wrecked as a result of punctures on high 
speed descents, and previously had replaced the lower jockey wheel in 
the original rear gear mech).  The other problem I have is that the 
clearance between the tyre and the rear mech is also minimal 
(especially as I use Greenspeed Scorcher tyres which are wider than 
most tyres) - after a rear wheel puncture, the cage on the rear gear 
mech can be bent, so using the lowest gear can quickly shred the side 
wall of the rear tyre (I have done this three times now - I keep 
telling myself to check the gear mech is not bent or misaligned, but 
forget occasionally - only when it IS bent or misaligned!)

Hi John,
        I was wondering how you came to the gearing range you quoted? By my
calculations you would have a bottom gear of 17x40/32 = 21, and even
16x40/32 = 20. In top I would expect 17x52/11x1.65= 133.

We certainly do not have any chain clearance problems with the Scorcher rear
tyres on the GTs. Maybe you could dish your rear wheel to the left, or/and
move the idler pulley out to the right to improve your chain clearance. Many
trike makers just use standard bicycle practice and dish the rear wheel to
the right, so that the tyre is centered about the dropouts or axle locknuts.
This weakens the rear wheel, and can give chain clearance problems, due to
the longer chain run on a recumbent. Whereas on a trike there is no need to
have the rear wheel on the centre line of the machine, as proven by the
Windcheatah, which runs quite a large offset. Thus you can build the rear
wheel symmetrically about the hub flanges, making it stronger and giving
more chain clearance, provided the frame is built to accommodate the tyre
offset. On a new trike I have built, I've discovered I still have chain
clearance in bottom gear, even with a 2.35" tyre :-)

We are using the Shimano Tiagra rear derailleur on some of the GTs, and
there have been no ground clearance problems with this derailleur. It is not
supposed to cope with larger than a 27 t rear cog, but I've found if the
hanger is long enough there is no real problem with a 32, apart from a bit
more noise in bottom gear...

The Big Apple rear tire might give you a bit more ground clearance ifyou  
need it

My gear calculations use a wheel diameter of 16.2 inches (which, on 
reflection, is probably for the original tyre the Micro came with, not 
that for the 349 Scorchers) and the CORRECT size for the small 
chainwheel which is 34 teeth, not 40 as I stated (that is the small 
chainwheel on my Trice XXL), which gives a low gear of 17.2 inches - if 
the diameter of the Scorcher is 17 inches, then my low gear is 18.1 
inches and my high gear is 132.6 inches.

There is no way to really re-dish the rear wheel - it is built like a 
rear wheel for an upright, with the drive-side spokes nearer to 90 
degrees from the rim than the off-side spokes. but the clearance 
between the 'seat' stays and the Scorcher tyre is about 3mm on each 
side - any change in dishing would not gain me much.

My clearance problems are with the gear mech when the lower jockey 
wheel is at the 6 o'clock position relative to the wheel - so moving 
the chain idler to the right would not make any difference here as the 
gear mech  and jockey wheel would not be moved to the right.

My gear mech is a Sram X9 medium cage and there is not really enough 
chain wrap as it is - when in the small chainring I have to remember to 
only use the larger rear cogs. - if I forget I am in the small 
chainring and run through the rear gears to the 11 tooth rear cog, the 
rear gear mech folds so far that the chain runs against itself and 
makes lots of noise!

The only thing I have done to increase clearance is to remove part of 
the left hand side of the derailleur cage - the lowest bit when at the 
6 o'clock position, as this is the bit that gets bent and then shreds 
the tyre - - on my original gear mech this bit fell off after several 
bendings, and its absence made no difference to gear changing etc, so 
when I replaced the mech, I removed this bit before using it.

I  do wonder why other trike manufacturers persist with dished wheels - 
the only reason for this is to provide heel clearance on traditional 
upright 2-wheelers - so no reason at all to have dished wheels on 
trikes (or, indeed, on 2-wheel recumbents).

That reminds me - must have another dig at Jason P****** - he got a 2nd 
hand Greenspeed and decided he did not want the hub gears, so had a new 
rear wheel built - only after he installed it did he realise there is 
no need to dish the rear wheel on a Greenspeed!

See my previous reply re Ian Sims suggestions - frame clearance 
limitations mean I cannot really use a tyre with a larger cross section 
than the Greenspeed Scorcher.

Subject: [trikes] steering design question
Message-ID: <fk1hkjrt5ndpkmgq7kgvol1y.1288289730514@email.android.com>

My wife was recently told she should use a wheelchair due to her ME. As keen cyclists we'd like to continue, and so I've been looking at designing an attachment for her chair which would convey it to something like a Vietnamese cyclo rickshaw 

http://www.rfleming.net/diarypics/Huecyclo2.jpg

Only thing I'm not certain about is the location of the steering pivot; should it be between the wheels like a kids soapbox kart, or behind the wheels like another conversion I've seen?

Any advice would be gratefully received.

There are several commercial machines available which are similar to 
this, where the wheelchair front and the 'cycle' rear can be split so 
the wheelchair can be used separately (in cafes etc) - however, the 
wheelchair part is much sturdier than a wheelchair, as it has to 
withstand the higher speeds of cycling - from my recollection of these 
sorts of machines, the steering pivot is slightly in front of the front 
wheel centres - to provide some trail and (presumably) damping to the 
steering.

Have you looked for this sort of machine on the web - a good starting 
point is the Velovision Special Needs Cycling Guide at

A trike that you might want to look at:http://www.frankmobility.com/duet.php
I tried a similar one and found the steering terrible at any speed.... 
so try to test ride before buying...

Have a look on the Christiana trikes site. Some drawings and ideas there 
might help. They have a wheelchair carrying trike. Also google 
wheelchair bicycle attachment should throw up some info.

Further to my reply yesterday, I have now had a chance to look at 2 
different wheelchair cycles - I help at a special needs cycle centre, 
and these two machines were given to the Centre in 2002 - they were 
both well used then.

The first machine is a Duet, where the steering pivot is about 5 inches 
in front of the front wheel axles.

The second machine is an 0 Pair (Dutch made) where the steering pivot 
is an inclined tube about 8 inches long - the bottom of the tube is 
about 2 inches below and 1/2 inch in front of the front wheel axles, 
while the top of the tube is a bout 2 inches in front..  The O Pair is 
still made (by Van Raam) but the modern machine is VERY different from 
the one at the Centre.

As I said before, both of these machines have a wheelchair part that is 
much stronger than a standard wheelchair.

If you really want to use a standard wheelchair, then a 
wheelchair-transporter is a possibility  - this is a splitable trike 
with a platform at the front onto which a wheelchair and wheelchair 
user can be loaded - the Centre got one of these (a Van Raam Velo Plus) 
at the start of 2009 at a cost (excluding VAT) of some ?5,400 - but 
this is a heavy machine and is not really practical for any distance - 
I would stick to a wheelchair cycle like the Duet or O Pair - I have 
seen several different modern ones in recent years, so they are made by 
several manufactures in various countries.

In my biased opinion all these machines are compromised against normal bicycles from an efficiency and
performance point of view.

For a start you have only one person providing the motive power, so that the non-active person is deprived of
exercise, and the other person is overworked. Then you have the increase in weight and drag over a couple of
bikes. And finally terrible road holding, handling and balance compared to a bicycle.

This is why we have built recumbent tandem trikes, where one rider has hand cranks, and the other foot cranks.
These machines have performance that is on a par, or better than standard bikes. Plus the stability is better
than ordinary bikes. 

With such a machine, Karen Darke and her partner toured New Zealand and the Himalayas.

There are several commercial machines available which are similar to 
this, where the wheelchair front and the 'cycle' rear can be split so 
the wheelchair can be used separately (in cafes etc) - however, the 
wheelchair part is much sturdier than a wheelchair, as it has to 
withstand the higher speeds of cycling - from my recollection of these 
sorts of machines, the steering pivot is slightly in front of the front 
wheel centres - to provide some trail and (presumably) damping to the 
steering.

Have you looked for this sort of machine on the web - a good starting 
point is the Velovision Special Needs Cycling Guide at

I agree with Ian. I spent a few hours recently in shop selling equipment for
disabled people and wasn't very impressed by the standard of the
non-motorised equipment. That said, I haven't seen the equipment the OP is
talking about - but the shop I was in was very successful and was selling
what purported to be top equipment.

In my biased opinion all these machines are compromised against normal
bicycles from an efficiency and performance point of view.

For a start you have only one person providing the motive power, so that the
non-active person is deprived of exercise, and the other person is
overworked. Then you have the increase in weight and drag over a couple of
bikes. And finally terrible road holding, handling and balance compared to a
bicycle.

This is why we have built recumbent tandem trikes, where one rider has hand
cranks, and the other foot cranks.
These machines have performance that is on a par, or better than standard
bikes. Plus the stability is better than ordinary bikes. 

With such a machine, Karen Darke and her partner toured New Zealand and the
Himalayas.

At the risk of joining the chorus, that's been my experience. The
dedicated wheelchairs are usually good, but anything bicycle-like is
usually quite amateur. Which leads wheelchair racers to be quite
disparaging of the pedal-powered stuff, and rightly so. But get them
onto something half decent and they usually change their minds. For
that matter, recumbent gear is usually priced like wheelchair gear.
