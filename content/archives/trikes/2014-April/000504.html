<PRE>Mea Culpa.  Back in 1980, I'd have bet that there would be more slick  
magazines full of trike components than model aircraft mags by now.   
Instead, we are still struggling along with bicycle parts, sometimes  
putting the rear derailleur cage closer to the ground than the wheel  
rim.

What I've had on the drawing board for far too long is very  
different, and need not be expensive to make.  It takes into account  
the need to guide the chain against side forces, and rationalizes the  
whole affair for a RWD recumbent tadpole trike.  The chain tensioner  
has always been used to select rear cogs because it fits well there  
on a bike, but a simple cage, as on the front derailleur is more than  
adequate for the slack run.  The chain tensioner can be relocated  
closer to the middle of the run, to replace the idlers often used,   
and the moving idler can be just guided in a straight line by a  
couple of loose slots in the chain guard and a spring.  That provides  
plenty of take-up to run big, efficient chainrings and super-wide  
range gears for a streamliner.  Efficiency on the rear cogs falls off  
badly under 15t, and big front rings reduce the chain force, reducing  
wear and frame flex.  They even give more room for a Browning type  
shifter on the front, to work even under power, like the rear.
