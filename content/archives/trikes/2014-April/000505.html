<PRE>Bob,
I just encountered that situation on our Kowal tandem. Its a 2x20&quot; ultra
short wheelbase tandem. 11x32 cassette, 60x48x36 chain rings.  The SRAM
Neos  RD wasn't shifting well and I couldn't remember how old it was. So I
bought a new MicroShift long cage RD. The cage was so long that it would be
dragging on the pavement in the event of a rear flat. The Neos is  a medium
cage unit. Amazing that it could shift that drive train as well as it did.
The problem appeared to be the lower jockey wheel  was missing a tooth. so
I adapted a Shimano jockey wheel to the Neos bearings. Cleaned and lubed.
Shifting well again.

Our Catrike Pocket has an SRAM XS RD (medium cage)  shifting 11x34 to
52x42x30.

When I tried to fit an 11x34 cassette on my WAW velomobile, the Shimano
Ultegra medium cage RD couldn't shift it. The B screw didn't have enough
adjustment. Since the rear wheel is 559, a long cage RD fit fine.

There may be a pattern here: does SRAM have more range than Shimano?
