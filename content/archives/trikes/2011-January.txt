Message-ID: <32F5B87D2CD34E20A8395CECA78CE542@EdPC>

I have just purchased a 20" Lithium powered E Bike motor kit that I am going to install on my Kettwiesel.  It should arrive early next week.  I was wondering if any of you have done this and might have some advice on things like, where to put the battery, the controller etc.  I have ordered the extra long cable and the torque lock and have seen a video on how to install the torque lock that is on ElectricBikeBuilding.com.

Anyway, any advice would be appreciated. 

Thanks,

Ed Logan
GRR, Vision Metro and my Kettwiesel

Never done it myself, but I saw an electric assist Kett once - the 
motor was in the front-wheel hub, the battery was mounted under the 
main frame tube behind the front wheel (so between the pedals - with 
the steering connecting rod having 4 gentle right-angle bends in it so 
it was above the main frame tube for the section where the battery was) 
and I have no idea where the controller was.

Hi,
I don't have the answers how to install, but I do have a Hase Keit. that I
need electric assist on. I just know most people tell me that the motor
needs to be on the front wheel.  Please post pics when you get this done and
let me know how you like the E-bike kit?
 thanks
Judy
