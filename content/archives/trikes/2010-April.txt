i realize that this is not the usual for sale location but since so few are sending messages i thought this would be the best place to show item for sale.  

zzipper trike fairing for sale.  originally i had this on my windcheetah. much of the hardware is not included as i abused it but the fairing itself is in first class shape.  i no longer have the windcheetah and it does not fit my current trike.  from what i have seen of cattrike fairings this will probably fit the bill.  this would be a good replacement if your current fairing is looking a bit abused.  fairing comes with custom cloth cover.

Subject: [trikes] Scorcher 406 Tires
Message-ID: <4BC3D610.1050203@zalonoffice.com>

I just switched over from the original Tioga Comp Pool tires to the 
(fairly) new Greenspeed Kevlar-beaded Scorchers for my GTO and pass 
along my (limited) experience in putting them on and trying to take them 
off the rim:

Putting them on was no problem; I was able to do it without using any 
tools. But taking them off was another thing entirely. I had installed 
an old tube in the right front tire; it had been repaired twice. I 
installed the tires on the 9th, and rode the trike again on the 11th. So 
far, no problem. But by this afternoon the right front tire was flat. 
OK, I assumed it was the fault of the old tube that had still not been 
fully repaired, so this evening I tried to change the tube. Tried is the 
operative word here, because I was totally unable to get the tire off 
the rim. First, it took herculean (for me) strength to push the bead off 
the rim, but even after that, I could not get the tire off the rim. I 
worked at it for 20 minutes, first while the trike was laying on its 
side; and when that was unsuccessful I removed the tire and used the 
tried and true method of setting the wheel on the ground and squeezing 
the rim, starting from the top, and moving down the rim, to give me the 
most room (at the bottom of the wheel) to work it off. No dice. After 20 
minutes, I gave up; I removed the valve core, squeezed in half a bottle 
of Slime, screwed the core back in and pumped the tire up to 110 psi. 
The damned thing wobbled a bit, but after a very fast ride down a hill 
in front of my house, it became tolerable. And it was not noticeable 
while riding.

I dunno what others have experienced with their Scorchers. A Bent Online 
item from a year or so ago reported the same experience I had, but many 
responses indicated that non-Kevlar Scorchers were a lot easier to 
remove. I don't know how much performance -- and speed -- I am giving 
away by using Slime in two tires (I previously installed some Slime in 
the rear tube because changing the rear tire on the GTO is a 
time-consuming exercise); only time will tell. I can say that my first 
couple of rides on the Scorchers were a real pleasure. They just felt 
noticeably faster. Hopefully the Slime won't substantially compromise 
the ride.

Anyone else have any experience with the Kevlar Scorchers? Or a way of 
getting them off the rim? (My left front tire is still Slimeless). If 
so, I would probably remove the Slime at least from the front tire(s?).

I have not used Scorchers, but of course that won't stop me from
commenting...

I think there may be a trick to this. If you have the Greenspeed rims (no
brake strip) they are designed with a deep channel between the sidewalls.
 You just have to get the far side bead down in that channel and the near
side bead should come right off.  The fact that you got them on easily
indicates the possibility of easy removal - without irons.  If they are not
the Greenspeed rims, then maybe the tires are just an unfortunate match with
them.

The kevlar bead should not be different from the steel except in stiffness.
 Neither is going to stretch, so if they are the same diameter you would
think they would be similar to install.  The main purposes of the kevlar are
lighter weight and foldability for packing.

It sounds like you did not have any tire irons/levers handy.  I help others
with their flats as often as my own so I keep a variety of them on hand.
 The weight penalty is worth the goodwill.

  I have used (non Kelvar) 20 inch (406) Scorchers and 16 inch (349) 
Scorchers

My experience with 406 Scorchers was not good - my 406 Scorchers were 
NEW (from the first production batch, air-freighted to the UK, posted 
to me, installed on my trice XXL, and used from the next day for a 
1,700 mile tour) - the main part of the tour was a group ride in France 
with 7 other people - during this period I had more punctures than all 
the others put together and the tyres were a nightmare to remove or 
replace (I had 4 plastic tyre leavers and 2 metal tyre leavers with me 
and used all of them every time) - I believe that Greenspeed had the 
tyres made sightly small to ensure a good fit, while the Trice rims 
were slightly large to ensure tyres stayed on - the combination was the 
problem.

I have being using 349 Scorchers for some time now on my Trice Micro - 
this is an early Micro (2001) with Brompton rims and (apart from 
problems when my gear mech was bent and was shredding the side wall of 
the tyre) have been very pleased with them - no more difficult to 
remove or install than other tyres and reasonably good for punctures 
and definitely a fast and more comfortable ride than any other tyre I 
have tried on my Micro.

It is my normal practice to buy my tyres in advance and keep them for a 
while before use -  the only tyres I have used which were brand new  
were the 406 Scorchers (and as I said, they were brand brand new - 
freshly manufactured, not just freshly purchased) and a set of standard 
Schawlbe Marathons, and the hight level of punctures experienced with 
both these sets reinforced my belief that it is best to age tyres 
before use.

I have owned 4 Greenspeed trikes in the last 10 years.  I've always  had 
comp pools on them, and felt they were just fine.  I'm not sharp enough  to 
know if some other tire is slightly better.  I've changed dozens of  flats 
without any trouble (maybe hundreds? nah...just seems that way)  My  newest GS, 
a tandem came with scorchers.  I could not believe how difficult  it is to 
get them off the rim.  It usually takes a full 20 minutes and 3  tire irons, 
one of which will break.  Recently I was touring with a friend  who is an 
experienced bike mechanic.  Struggling with the scorcher, I asked  him if I 
was doing something wrong.  "No my friend, this tire is just not  right for 
this rim."  
 
Consequently, I have replaced my front scorchers with my last 2 comp pools, 
 and my back tire with a marathon Big Apple.  
 
Obviously I am a big fan of Greenspeed...and continue to be!!!  But  the 
scorcher might need a bit of revision.  Mine have been "retired".
 
PS...I know the trick about getting the beads into the deepest part of the  
rim....not the issue here.

I am not disagreeing that it was hard, but how come it was easy for Jules to
mount the?  I guess I have seen that with upright tires, too.  It is
definitely hard to mount tight tires on small rims, much worse that with
larger wheel sizes.

I use Scorcher tyres but I use Velocity Aeroheat rims (deep) which may
explain why I have never had this difficulty. I had a problem with all  
tyres
before making the switch.

Have never had Scorchers so can't comment there, but I've often seen 
tyre/rim pairings that were just "tight", even on big wheels. Until Comp 
Pools became hard to get I always ran those on trikes - they wear well 
despite being soft and rarely punctured. Some failed due to perishing 
over time and de-laminating in the sidewalls.

I just got back from two weeks touring on a Greenspeed Glyde...
As I've been riding back roads as well as good quality main roads I've had a number of punctures. I'm not sure what rims are on the front of this machine but it seemed much easier to change the 349mm  Scorchers on the front than the 406mm one on the back... But I was fixing the rear tube without removing the wheel, by dropping the tyre off one side, patching the tube, and refitting all without bothering to remove the rear valance of the velomobile. I did manage to snap two tyre levers on this trip - a brand new set of Specialized 'Pry Babies'  - I thought these looked like an upgrade from my usual Schwalbe ones but they'll be sent back as unfit for purpose...
I never found removing the tyre to be too much of a challenge but sometimes getting that last little bit of tyre back over the rim can be a fight!

Anyone who really likes Scorchers might  consider customizing their rims 
to match.  A disk sander can be used to both rotate and abrade anything 
on an axle.  Doing one side should suffice.

I don't quite get it.  Is that because you believe Scorchers are not
that smooth (a ride)?
