<PRE>Jim,

At last another bent rider chimes in.  The common wisdom of uprights
has to be viewed with a jaundiced eye when you are a bent guy.

Don't ever mash is your only path.  If you don't spin shorter cranks,
then there is little reason to have them.  But theoretically, mashing
shorter cranks should be less hard on them because the joint angles
are going to be less. (Significant? Depends on the the lengths being
compared.)

I think if you are having trouble and are considering not being able
to ride at all, then try some really short cranks before giving up
(with the requisite lower gearing all around).  Dotek 150mm should be
findable without a large expense (used = very cheap).  These will
probably have smaller MTB chainrings, too.  I know a trike home
builder who has used these a lot.  To go shorter you need to keep an
eye pealed for used cranks that have a solid arm than can be shortened
- there is enough metal where the new holes go.  It takes a machinist
that is patient and creative, but you can get a new hole drilled
paralell to the BB.  Re-threading taps can be used to tap the hole.
It is hard to find anything like a regular tap, but re-threading taps
are not uncommon and will work if you are careful.  Park Tool?

Have you seen the right professionals about your knees?  I was
misdiagnosed as having patella-femoral syndrome by an orthopedic
surgeon. Turns out I really had developed flat feet and inserts cured
all.  This was winkled out by a PhD in Physical Therapy.  All I had to
do was stand across the room from her and she sussed it out.

There is an exercise for the inner quad (I forget the correct name)
where you squeeze a ball between your knees while doing a light half
squat.  This muscle is implicated in pattelo femoral syndrome which is
an imbalance of muscles and a banjo tight illiotibial band.  It causes
your knee cap to track off to the side of where it should be.  PT is
the solution.

You said inside of the thigh, maybe you meant a groin muscle not a
quad?  That would be something different.

Good luck.

Mike
