</I>Hey,
        I have  Trice Explorer with  Hope Minidiscs.  I have found that they 
are very easy to disassemble, clean and reassemble and bleed.

If the pistons are just stuck through lack of use (as Peter Bradshaw suspects) 
then be carefull as you follow his instructions in case the pistons have 
stuck to the seal .. you dont want to tear the seal.  I got a lot of spares 
for my Hope Minidiscs from:-

   <A HREF="http://www.ukbikestore.co.uk/">http://www.ukbikestore.co.uk/</A>

Seals, washers, etc

The Hope website is at:-

   <A HREF="http://www.hopetech.com/">http://www.hopetech.com/</A>

There is some technical information on that site. 

One of my discs had an oversize piston which caused it to stick as yours do.
I contacted Hope in the USA and they refurbished the caliper for me.  You 
might wish to contact them if you feel you cannot handle freeing the piston 
yourself.  They repaired my caliper and got it back to me within two days .. 
they were in Southern California (in Cherry Valley) and I live in San jose so 
YMMV.  I dont know if they still have that office in the USA.

cheers
