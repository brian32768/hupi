<PRE>This is in response to Ed Logan's query about what rpm we spin at:

Despite the fact that I have an arthritic knee (the result of the 
surgical removal of my meniscus around 50 years ago), I still consider 
myself a grinder on my uprights, which have 175s on them. My cadence on 
uprights is generally around 90. The reason I opted for the crank 
shorteners (now set at 150mm ) is because it felt like I was lifting my 
knees almost to my stomach when pedaling my Greenspeed GTO (originally 
with 175s) and I was wasting a lot of energy doing it. So my switching 
to shorter cranks was for both comfort and efficiency. I find that my 
cadence is usually around 100; sometimes much higher, but I can't stay 
much higher than 100 for very long. It just tires me out.

But I agree that the cure for that is to spin even more.
