<PRE>By the sounds of it, you already have some short cranks, which is good.  If 
you're still grinding on them, that's worse than if you had stayed with 
longer cranks.

Short cranks aren't a cure all for pedalling and knee woes.  If you are 
spinning with long cranks, your cadence will increase with short ones, and 
you will be quite happy with them and so will your knees.  If you are 
grinding with long cranks don't be surprised if short cranks make your knees 
worse.  The cadence is irrelevent, it's foot speed that is important - 
cadence is just how we measure it.  If your foot speed on the short cranks 
is as slow as on the long ones, your knees will hurt more because your lever 
arm is shorter.  Short cranks MIGHT help your knees, even with too low of a 
cadence because they bend your knee less.

Bottom line, is you need to spin at 80 to 100 for long cranks, and obviously 
the cadence will be higher with shorter ones.  Especially if you have bad 
knees.  If your muscles get tired from spinning, that's because you don't 
spin enough.  So keep spinning.  My knees are busted up too, and aside from 
all the benefit spinning, short cranks and oval rings have provided, I 
recently stumbled across a few pages talking about the evils of being &quot;quad 
dominant&quot;.  I present all the symptoms of slightly knock kneed, knees 
together when I stand up from sitting, popping knees, rolled ankles, flat 
feet, etc.  I've been doing some simple exercises (about 4 minutes a day at 
lunch) to cure it and the improvements are fast and obvious.  I'll see if I 
can track down the site again.


&gt;<i> i'm calling in the pros.  this has probably been discussed more than the 
</I>&gt;<i> price of milk and butter but now it has bitten  me in the butt.  i've read 
</I>&gt;<i> all the press that shorter cranks make spinning easier.  that being said 
</I>&gt;<i> that for the first time i am having knee issues while wearing knee braces 
</I>&gt;<i> and am wondering if these shorties are causing the knee pain when i want 
</I>&gt;<i> to crank like i do on longer ones. the knee braces work well on my stratus 
</I>&gt;<i> and other trikes that i have owned.  i'm finding that if i don't spin i'm 
</I>&gt;<i> in for a long day. i also find that if i do spin and do it all day 
</I>&gt;<i> prolonged spin results in the muscle on the inside of my thigh fatiguing 
</I>&gt;<i> rapidly.
