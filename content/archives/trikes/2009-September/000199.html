<PRE>Funny, I mistook this for a comment to a non bent non trike list I was
involved in.  25Hz was using the Doteks.  Maybe he can help you find
some.

</I>&gt;<i> At last another bent rider chimes in. &#160;The common wisdom of uprights
</I>&gt;<i> has to be viewed with a jaundiced eye when you are a bent guy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't ever mash is your only path. &#160;If you don't spin shorter cranks,
</I>&gt;<i> then there is little reason to have them. &#160;But theoretically, mashing
</I>&gt;<i> shorter cranks should be less hard on them because the joint angles
</I>&gt;<i> are going to be less. (Significant? Depends on the the lengths being
</I>&gt;<i> compared.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think if you are having trouble and are considering not being able
</I>&gt;<i> to ride at all, then try some really short cranks before giving up
</I>&gt;<i> (with the requisite lower gearing all around). &#160;Dotek 150mm should be
</I>&gt;<i> findable without a large expense (used = very cheap). &#160;These will
</I>&gt;<i> probably have smaller MTB chainrings, too. &#160;I know a trike home
</I>&gt;<i> builder who has used these a lot. &#160;To go shorter you need to keep an
</I>&gt;<i> eye pealed for used cranks that have a solid arm than can be shortened
</I>&gt;<i> - there is enough metal where the new holes go. &#160;It takes a machinist
</I>&gt;<i> that is patient and creative, but you can get a new hole drilled
</I>&gt;<i> paralell to the BB. &#160;Re-threading taps can be used to tap the hole.
</I>&gt;<i> It is hard to find anything like a regular tap, but re-threading taps
</I>&gt;<i> are not uncommon and will work if you are careful. &#160;Park Tool?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you seen the right professionals about your knees? &#160;I was
</I>&gt;<i> misdiagnosed as having patella-femoral syndrome by an orthopedic
</I>&gt;<i> surgeon. Turns out I really had developed flat feet and inserts cured
</I>&gt;<i> all. &#160;This was winkled out by a PhD in Physical Therapy. &#160;All I had to
</I>&gt;<i> do was stand across the room from her and she sussed it out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an exercise for the inner quad (I forget the correct name)
</I>&gt;<i> where you squeeze a ball between your knees while doing a light half
</I>&gt;<i> squat. &#160;This muscle is implicated in pattelo femoral syndrome which is
</I>&gt;<i> an imbalance of muscles and a banjo tight illiotibial band. &#160;It causes
</I>&gt;<i> your knee cap to track off to the side of where it should be. &#160;PT is
</I>&gt;<i> the solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You said inside of the thigh, maybe you meant a groin muscle not a
</I>&gt;<i> quad? &#160;That would be something different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i'm calling in the pros. &#160;this has probably been discussed more than the price of milk and butter but now it has bitten &#160;me in the butt. &#160;i've read all the press that shorter cranks make spinning easier. &#160;that being said that for the first time i am having knee issues while wearing knee braces and am wondering if these shorties are causing the knee pain when i want to crank like i do on longer ones. the knee braces work well on my stratus and other trikes that i have owned. &#160;i'm finding that if i don't spin i'm in for a long day. i also find that if i do spin and do it all day prolonged spin results in the muscle on the inside of my thigh fatiguing rapidly.
