<PRE>There are also the Bulletproof cranks from 
<A HREF="http://www.gaerlan.com/bikeparts/parts/crank/crank.html">http://www.gaerlan.com/bikeparts/parts/crank/crank.html</A> which you can 
get down to 140mm for 50 dollars.

&gt;<i> Jim,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At last another bent rider chimes in.  The common wisdom of uprights
</I>&gt;<i> has to be viewed with a jaundiced eye when you are a bent guy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't ever mash is your only path.  If you don't spin shorter cranks,
</I>&gt;<i> then there is little reason to have them.  But theoretically, mashing
</I>&gt;<i> shorter cranks should be less hard on them because the joint angles
</I>&gt;<i> are going to be less. (Significant? Depends on the the lengths being
</I>&gt;<i> compared.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think if you are having trouble and are considering not being able
</I>&gt;<i> to ride at all, then try some really short cranks before giving up
</I>&gt;<i> (with the requisite lower gearing all around).  Dotek 150mm should be
</I>&gt;<i> findable without a large expense (used = very cheap).  These will
</I>&gt;<i> probably have smaller MTB chainrings, too.  I know a trike home
</I>&gt;<i> builder who has used these a lot.  To go shorter you need to keep an
</I>&gt;<i> eye pealed for used cranks that have a solid arm than can be shortened
</I>&gt;<i> - there is enough metal where the new holes go.  It takes a machinist
</I>&gt;<i> that is patient and creative, but you can get a new hole drilled
</I>&gt;<i> paralell to the BB.  Re-threading taps can be used to tap the hole.
</I>&gt;<i> It is hard to find anything like a regular tap, but re-threading taps
</I>&gt;<i> are not uncommon and will work if you are careful.  Park Tool?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you seen the right professionals about your knees?  I was
</I>&gt;<i> misdiagnosed as having patella-femoral syndrome by an orthopedic
</I>&gt;<i> surgeon. Turns out I really had developed flat feet and inserts cured
</I>&gt;<i> all.  This was winkled out by a PhD in Physical Therapy.  All I had to
</I>&gt;<i> do was stand across the room from her and she sussed it out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an exercise for the inner quad (I forget the correct name)
</I>&gt;<i> where you squeeze a ball between your knees while doing a light half
</I>&gt;<i> squat.  This muscle is implicated in pattelo femoral syndrome which is
</I>&gt;<i> an imbalance of muscles and a banjo tight illiotibial band.  It causes
</I>&gt;<i> your knee cap to track off to the side of where it should be.  PT is
</I>&gt;<i> the solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You said inside of the thigh, maybe you meant a groin muscle not a
</I>&gt;<i> quad?  That would be something different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i'm calling in the pros.  this has probably been discussed more than the price of milk and butter but now it has bitten  me in the butt.  i've read all the press that shorter cranks make spinning easier.  that being said that for the first time i am having knee issues while wearing knee braces and am wondering if these shorties are causing the knee pain when i want to crank like i do on longer ones. the knee braces work well on my stratus and other trikes that i have owned.  i'm finding that if i don't spin i'm in for a long day. i also find that if i do spin and do it all day prolonged spin results in the muscle on the inside of my thigh fatiguing rapidly.
