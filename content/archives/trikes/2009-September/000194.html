<PRE>Hi Kate;

I suspect that the slave pistons are stuck because of the lack of use.
The first thing to try is to unbolt the calipers and, using a suitable
flat bladed srewdriver, force the pads open. Then put the calipers over
the disk so that the disk is between the pads - no need to bolt them in
place - and squeeze the brake levers. Repeat this a couple of times
being carefull not to squeeze the brake lever unless the disk is between
the pads.

You probably do not have a problem with with the brake fluid but, in any
case, bleeding the brakes or replacing the fluid is the very last thing
to try because it is often difficult to refill the system.
