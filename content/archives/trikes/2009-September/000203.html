<PRE>Hi Jim, I have some 155mm road cranks in 130/74bcd configuration  
(<A HREF="http://www.pbwbikes.com/product_info.php/cPath/26/products_id/65">http://www.pbwbikes.com/product_info.php/cPath/26/products_id/65</A>) that  
are well-made generic ones.

It is tempting to drill a hole and tap it by hand. In practice, it is  
almost impossible to get the hole to be lined up correctly. If the hole is  
drilled or the tapping is akimbo, then your foot will rotate around in a  
randomly oriented circle as you pedal. This may not be good for your knee.

If you want to be sure of it, make sure you hold the crank accurately and  
securely and drill straight down with a machine. A milling machine works  
great if you have some fixturing.

A Schlumpf-drive is easily configured with a wide range of lengths.

Best regards, --Hugh

-- original message --

i'm calling in the pros.  this has probably been discussed more than the  
price of milk and butter but now it has bitten  me in the butt.  i've read  
all the press that shorter cranks make spinning easier.  that being said  
that for the first time i am having knee issues while wearing knee braces  
and am wondering if these shorties are causing the knee pain when i want  
to crank like i do on longer ones. the knee braces work well on my stratus  
and other trikes that i have owned.  i'm finding that if i don't spin i'm  
in for a long day. i also find that if i do spin and do it all day  
prolonged spin results in the muscle on the inside of my thigh fatiguing  
rapidly.
