<PRE>  I have used (non Kelvar) 20 inch (406) Scorchers and 16 inch (349) 
Scorchers

My experience with 406 Scorchers was not good - my 406 Scorchers were 
NEW (from the first production batch, air-freighted to the UK, posted 
to me, installed on my trice XXL, and used from the next day for a 
1,700 mile tour) - the main part of the tour was a group ride in France 
with 7 other people - during this period I had more punctures than all 
the others put together and the tyres were a nightmare to remove or 
replace (I had 4 plastic tyre leavers and 2 metal tyre leavers with me 
and used all of them every time) - I believe that Greenspeed had the 
tyres made sightly small to ensure a good fit, while the Trice rims 
were slightly large to ensure tyres stayed on - the combination was the 
problem.

I have being using 349 Scorchers for some time now on my Trice Micro - 
this is an early Micro (2001) with Brompton rims and (apart from 
problems when my gear mech was bent and was shredding the side wall of 
the tyre) have been very pleased with them - no more difficult to 
remove or install than other tyres and reasonably good for punctures 
and definitely a fast and more comfortable ride than any other tyre I 
have tried on my Micro.

It is my normal practice to buy my tyres in advance and keep them for a 
while before use -  the only tyres I have used which were brand new  
were the 406 Scorchers (and as I said, they were brand brand new - 
freshly manufactured, not just freshly purchased) and a set of standard 
Schawlbe Marathons, and the hight level of punctures experienced with 
both these sets reinforced my belief that it is best to age tyres 
before use.
