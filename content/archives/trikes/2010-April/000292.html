<PRE>I just switched over from the original Tioga Comp Pool tires to the 
(fairly) new Greenspeed Kevlar-beaded Scorchers for my GTO and pass 
along my (limited) experience in putting them on and trying to take them 
off the rim:

Putting them on was no problem; I was able to do it without using any 
tools. But taking them off was another thing entirely. I had installed 
an old tube in the right front tire; it had been repaired twice. I 
installed the tires on the 9th, and rode the trike again on the 11th. So 
far, no problem. But by this afternoon the right front tire was flat. 
OK, I assumed it was the fault of the old tube that had still not been 
fully repaired, so this evening I tried to change the tube. Tried is the 
operative word here, because I was totally unable to get the tire off 
the rim. First, it took herculean (for me) strength to push the bead off 
the rim, but even after that, I could not get the tire off the rim. I 
worked at it for 20 minutes, first while the trike was laying on its 
side; and when that was unsuccessful I removed the tire and used the 
tried and true method of setting the wheel on the ground and squeezing 
the rim, starting from the top, and moving down the rim, to give me the 
most room (at the bottom of the wheel) to work it off. No dice. After 20 
minutes, I gave up; I removed the valve core, squeezed in half a bottle 
of Slime, screwed the core back in and pumped the tire up to 110 psi. 
The damned thing wobbled a bit, but after a very fast ride down a hill 
in front of my house, it became tolerable. And it was not noticeable 
while riding.

I dunno what others have experienced with their Scorchers. A Bent Online 
item from a year or so ago reported the same experience I had, but many 
responses indicated that non-Kevlar Scorchers were a lot easier to 
remove. I don't know how much performance -- and speed -- I am giving 
away by using Slime in two tires (I previously installed some Slime in 
the rear tube because changing the rear tire on the GTO is a 
time-consuming exercise); only time will tell. I can say that my first 
couple of rides on the Scorchers were a real pleasure. They just felt 
noticeably faster. Hopefully the Slime won't substantially compromise 
the ride.

Anyone else have any experience with the Kevlar Scorchers? Or a way of 
getting them off the rim? (My left front tire is still Slimeless). If 
so, I would probably remove the Slime at least from the front tire(s?).
