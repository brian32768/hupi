<PRE>Anyone who really likes Scorchers might  consider customizing their rims 
to match.  A disk sander can be used to both rotate and abrade anything 
on an axle.  Doing one side should suffice.

I'm not sure what rims are on the front of this machine but it seemed much easier to change the 349mm  Scorchers on the front than the 406mm one on the back... But I was fixing the rear tube without removing the wheel, by dropping the tyre off one side, patching the tube, and refitting all without bothering to remove the rear valance of the velomobile. I did manage to snap two tyre levers on this trip - a brand new set of Specialized 'Pry Babies'  - I thought these looked like an upgrade from my usual Schwalbe ones but they'll be sent back as unfit for purpose...
</I>&gt;<i> I never found removing the tyre to be too much of a challenge but sometimes getting that last little bit of tyre back over the rim can be a fight!
