<PRE>Subject: Scorcher 406 Tyres

I use Scorcher tyres but I use Velocity Aeroheat rims (deep) which may
explain why I have never had this difficulty. I had a problem with all  
tyres
before making the switch.

</I>&gt;<i> I just switched over from the original Tioga Comp Pool tires to the
</I>&gt;<i> (fairly) new Greenspeed Kevlar-beaded Scorchers for my GTO and pass
</I>&gt;<i> along my (limited) experience in putting them on and trying to take  
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> off the rim:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Putting them on was no problem; I was able to do it without using any
</I>&gt;<i> tools. But taking them off was another thing entirely. I had installed
</I>&gt;<i> an old tube in the right front tire; it had been repaired twice. I
</I>&gt;<i> installed the tires on the 9th, and rode the trike again on the  
</I>&gt;<i> 11th. So
</I>&gt;<i> far, no problem. But by this afternoon the right front tire was flat.
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I assumed it was the fault of the old tube that had still not been
</I>&gt;<i> fully repaired, so this evening I tried to change the tube. Tried is  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> operative word here, because I was totally unable to get the tire off
</I>&gt;<i> the rim. First, it took herculean (for me) strength to push the bead  
</I>&gt;<i> off
</I>&gt;<i> the rim, but even after that, I could not get the tire off the rim. I
</I>&gt;<i> worked at it for 20 minutes, first while the trike was laying on its
</I>&gt;<i> side; and when that was unsuccessful I removed the tire and used the
</I>&gt;<i> tried and true method of setting the wheel on the ground and squeezing
</I>&gt;<i> the rim, starting from the top, and moving down the rim, to give me  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> most room (at the bottom of the wheel) to work it off. No dice.  
</I>&gt;<i> After 20
</I>&gt;<i> minutes, I gave up; I removed the valve core, squeezed in half a  
</I>&gt;<i> bottle
</I>&gt;<i> of Slime, screwed the core back in and pumped the tire up to 110 psi.
</I>&gt;<i> The damned thing wobbled a bit, but after a very fast ride down a hill
</I>&gt;<i> in front of my house, it became tolerable. And it was not noticeable
</I>&gt;<i> while riding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dunno what others have experienced with their Scorchers. A Bent  
</I>&gt;<i> Online
</I>&gt;<i> item from a year or so ago reported the same experience I had, but  
</I>&gt;<i> many
</I>&gt;<i> responses indicated that non-Kevlar Scorchers were a lot easier to
</I>&gt;<i> remove. I don't know how much performance -- and speed -- I am giving
</I>&gt;<i> away by using Slime in two tires (I previously installed some Slime in
</I>&gt;<i> the rear tube because changing the rear tire on the GTO is a
</I>&gt;<i> time-consuming exercise); only time will tell. I can say that my first
</I>&gt;<i> couple of rides on the Scorchers were a real pleasure. They just felt
</I>&gt;<i> noticeably faster. Hopefully the Slime won't substantially compromise
</I>&gt;<i> the ride.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone else have any experience with the Kevlar Scorchers? Or a way of
</I>&gt;<i> getting them off the rim? (My left front tire is still Slimeless). If
</I>&gt;<i> so, I would probably remove the Slime at least from the front  
</I>&gt;<i> tire(s?).

</I>&gt;<i> I have not used Scorchers, but of course that won't stop me from
</I>&gt;<i> commenting...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there may be a trick to this. If you have the Greenspeed  
</I>&gt;<i> rims (no
</I>&gt;<i> brake strip) they are designed with a deep channel between the  
</I>&gt;<i> sidewalls.
</I>&gt;<i> You just have to get the far side bead down in that channel and the  
</I>&gt;<i> near
</I>&gt;<i> side bead should come right off.  The fact that you got them on easily
</I>&gt;<i> indicates the possibility of easy removal - without irons.  If they  
</I>&gt;<i> are not
</I>&gt;<i> the Greenspeed rims, then maybe the tires are just an unfortunate  
</I>&gt;<i> match with
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The kevlar bead should not be different from the steel except in  
</I>&gt;<i> stiffness.
</I>&gt;<i> Neither is going to stretch, so if they are the same diameter you  
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> think they would be similar to install.  The main purposes of the  
</I>&gt;<i> kevlar are
</I>&gt;<i> lighter weight and foldability for packing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you did not have any tire irons/levers handy.  I help  
</I>&gt;<i> others
</I>&gt;<i> with their flats as often as my own so I keep a variety of them on  
</I>&gt;<i> hand.
</I>&gt;<i> The weight penalty is worth the goodwill.
