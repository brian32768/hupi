<PRE>I have owned 4 Greenspeed trikes in the last 10 years.  I've always  had 
comp pools on them, and felt they were just fine.  I'm not sharp enough  to 
know if some other tire is slightly better.  I've changed dozens of  flats 
without any trouble (maybe hundreds? nah...just seems that way)  My  newest GS, 
a tandem came with scorchers.  I could not believe how difficult  it is to 
get them off the rim.  It usually takes a full 20 minutes and 3  tire irons, 
one of which will break.  Recently I was touring with a friend  who is an 
experienced bike mechanic.  Struggling with the scorcher, I asked  him if I 
was doing something wrong.  &quot;No my friend, this tire is just not  right for 
this rim.&quot;  
 
Consequently, I have replaced my front scorchers with my last 2 comp pools, 
 and my back tire with a marathon Big Apple.  
 
Obviously I am a big fan of Greenspeed...and continue to be!!!  But  the 
scorcher might need a bit of revision.  Mine have been &quot;retired&quot;.
 
PS...I know the trick about getting the beads into the deepest part of the  
rim....not the issue here.
