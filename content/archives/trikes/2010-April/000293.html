<PRE>I have not used Scorchers, but of course that won't stop me from
commenting...

I think there may be a trick to this. If you have the Greenspeed rims (no
brake strip) they are designed with a deep channel between the sidewalls.
 You just have to get the far side bead down in that channel and the near
side bead should come right off.  The fact that you got them on easily
indicates the possibility of easy removal - without irons.  If they are not
the Greenspeed rims, then maybe the tires are just an unfortunate match with
them.

The kevlar bead should not be different from the steel except in stiffness.
 Neither is going to stretch, so if they are the same diameter you would
think they would be similar to install.  The main purposes of the kevlar are
lighter weight and foldability for packing.

It sounds like you did not have any tire irons/levers handy.  I help others
with their flats as often as my own so I keep a variety of them on hand.
 The weight penalty is worth the goodwill.

&gt;<i> I just switched over from the original Tioga Comp Pool tires to the
</I>&gt;<i> (fairly) new Greenspeed Kevlar-beaded Scorchers for my GTO and pass along my
</I>&gt;<i> (limited) experience in putting them on and trying to take them off the rim:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Putting them on was no problem; I was able to do it without using any
</I>&gt;<i> tools. But taking them off was another thing entirely. I had installed an
</I>&gt;<i> old tube in the right front tire; it had been repaired twice. I installed
</I>&gt;<i> the tires on the 9th, and rode the trike again on the 11th. So far, no
</I>&gt;<i> problem. But by this afternoon the right front tire was flat. OK, I assumed
</I>&gt;<i> it was the fault of the old tube that had still not been fully repaired, so
</I>&gt;<i> this evening I tried to change the tube. Tried is the operative word here,
</I>&gt;<i> because I was totally unable to get the tire off the rim. First, it took
</I>&gt;<i> herculean (for me) strength to push the bead off the rim, but even after
</I>&gt;<i> that, I could not get the tire off the rim. I worked at it for 20 minutes,
</I>&gt;<i> first while the trike was laying on its side; and when that was unsuccessful
</I>&gt;<i> I removed the tire and used the tried and true method of setting the wheel
</I>&gt;<i> on the ground and squeezing the rim, starting from the top, and moving down
</I>&gt;<i> the rim, to give me the most room (at the bottom of the wheel) to work it
</I>&gt;<i> off. No dice. After 20 minutes, I gave up; I removed the valve core,
</I>&gt;<i> squeezed in half a bottle of Slime, screwed the core back in and pumped the
</I>&gt;<i> tire up to 110 psi. The damned thing wobbled a bit, but after a very fast
</I>&gt;<i> ride down a hill in front of my house, it became tolerable. And it was not
</I>&gt;<i> noticeable while riding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dunno what others have experienced with their Scorchers. A Bent Online
</I>&gt;<i> item from a year or so ago reported the same experience I had, but many
</I>&gt;<i> responses indicated that non-Kevlar Scorchers were a lot easier to remove. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know how much performance -- and speed -- I am giving away by using
</I>&gt;<i> Slime in two tires (I previously installed some Slime in the rear tube
</I>&gt;<i> because changing the rear tire on the GTO is a time-consuming exercise);
</I>&gt;<i> only time will tell. I can say that my first couple of rides on the
</I>&gt;<i> Scorchers were a real pleasure. They just felt noticeably faster. Hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> the Slime won't substantially compromise the ride.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone else have any experience with the Kevlar Scorchers? Or a way of
</I>&gt;<i> getting them off the rim? (My left front tire is still Slimeless). If so, I
</I>&gt;<i> would probably remove the Slime at least from the front tire(s?).
