<PRE>Considering you spent good money for a BionX system and it is still in
warranty I strongly suggest having the system made &quot;as good as new&quot; by
BionX.

Your dealer should be able to have the warranty wheel come back in the
same size as your own. If you have laced a 26&quot; wheel into a 20&quot; hub
you have a speed problem as the 20&quot; version and the 26&quot; versions have
different RPM characteristics.

Based on your description of the problem I strongly suspect a problem
not in the wheel but in the control console. Some systems made about
the time you bough yours have experienced similar problems. It might
even require having the whole system (motor, battery and control
console) components sent back to BionX for evaluation and repair.

This system is too much of an investment (and too good a system) to
remain on the shelf. At least if you have it repaired you can recoup
some of your investment if you choose a different system because it is
in high demand and holds its value well.

It will be hard to find a more suitable system or a lighter system
that your PL-350 (though there are some light ones available none have
quite the &quot;package&quot; of the PL-350). One challenge to overcome might be
how/where you mounted the batteries. This can affect overall trike
balance and/or handling.

If your dealer (always your first step) is not able to resolve these
issues under warranty please feel free to send me your serial numbers
off-list and I will see what I can do regarding BionX service
replacements.

&gt;<i> I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X. &#160;I
</I>&gt;<i> installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago for my
</I>&gt;<i> wife. &#160;I got what info I could from internet sources to make a decision. &#160;No
</I>&gt;<i> one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time. &#160; I was
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged that I had made the right decision &#160;when I saw that Wizwheelz
</I>&gt;<i> offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but now I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see this option on their web site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problems are:
</I>&gt;<i> The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is disconnected.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8 minutes to
</I>&gt;<i> reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using the
</I>&gt;<i> throttle when running too slow. &#160; Recently, got into mode running at 18mph,
</I>&gt;<i> and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It is a complete system. &#160;Not too difficult to install on the TT-3.6 --
</I>&gt;<i> even though it was never designed for this.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster riders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do not like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Heavy. &#160; Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy. &#160; Weight bias to
</I>&gt;<i> rear.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Poor customer service from the factory. &#160;They mostly do not answer e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> inquiries.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20&quot; wheel the space between rim and
</I>&gt;<i> motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire pump.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. See problems above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering the
</I>&gt;<i> distance. &#160;The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the problem
</I>&gt;<i> remains. &#160;I think the battery was replaced twice. &#160;A new motor was sent with
</I>&gt;<i> 26&quot; wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20&quot; rim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time ago. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
</I>&gt;<i> customers had problems. &#160;After a while the Bion-X factory became too
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this message
</I>&gt;<i> after I had already purchased one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
</I>&gt;<i> problems with BionX. &#160;I seem to be the only one experiencing the system
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lock-up&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the drive-train of
</I>&gt;<i> the trike without doing a lot of custom work. &#160; I realize that with these
</I>&gt;<i> systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub. &#160;Also, most
</I>&gt;<i> likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you can with
</I>&gt;<i> a hub motor. &#160;Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.
