<PRE>No doubt there are plenty of fast Tadpole Trikes on the market.  As  
for a fast Delta, don't forget the RANS Trizard.  Very interesting  
design and I find it to be competitive speed wise with some pretty  
quick Tadpole Trikes.  All the Trizard needs is a good pair of  
aerodynamic fenders on the rear wheels.  They could look cool, add  
speed and keep your elbows from inadvertently contacting the wheels  
while riding.

For what it's worth, I find that on average, I am at least 2 mph  
faster on a fast, two wheeled recumbent.  Something like a Bacchetta  
Corsa or a RANS Force 5.

Heard a rumor that Bacchetta is working on a long wheel base, Tadpole,  
leaning design Trike?  Could be fun!

One more thing, while we are talking about speed.  When you enclose  
the Trike, like a Greenspeed Glyde, Go-One, Quest or any of the other  
Velomobiles on the market, that's where it starts to really get fun.   
On flat terrain it's hard to believe the speeds you can get up to  
without much power input.  As soon as the road heads down, it's  
amazing!  On long climbs, electric assist would be nice ;^)

On my last visit to the RANS headquarters in HAYS Kansas, I saw a cad  
drawing of a Trizard with a full body.  Very nice looking design, it  
even had a little wing like spoiler on the back with solar panels on  
it for?  As an aircraft manufacturer, RANS certainly has the  
production capability and knowledge to produce an awesome, light  
weight Velomobile, no doubt about that in my mind.  If offered, I'd  
order one tomorrow!
