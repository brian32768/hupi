<PRE>Juergen and Giles

Thanks for the replies.

I believe that the Control Head unit has never been replaced.   I did sent
it back to the dealer with the battery in one of the various exchanges, but
they sent the same one back.

You are correct about the 26 vs 20 hub motor setup.  I did lace it up after
discussing with the dealer (apparently he did not know this would be a
problem).   I can't remember the details, but it operated very strangely --
so I changed back to the old motor and then the dealer finally sent the
correct 20&quot; wheel and motor assembly.

My wife had such a bad experience with the BionX system on a recent trip
that she said to remove it from the trike.  But after the first ride without
it, she realized that as troublesome as it is; it is better than no assist.

I don't know what to think about the warranty now.  Since it has been about
1.5yrs since the original purchase, I figured the warranty was gone.
Perhaps since it has never worked properly, I can use that argument for
extending the warranty.

I mounted the battery transversely, immediately behind the seat on the
frame.  Considering my wife's riding style I don't think that weight
distribution is a problem.  Mounting the battery on the top of the boom
seemed to be too obtrusive and the ground clearance underneath the boom did
not look adequate.  I have seen a WW Tour with the battery mounted on the
back of the seat and to one side, but I did not like this because the CG was
higher and offset compared to what I had done

I will contact the dealer again, and see what can be done first.  I
suggested a few times to the dealer to do a full system change-over, but
they never agreed to this.

I will admit that when the BionX operates properly, it is a worthwhile
system.

Bob

&gt;<i> Considering you spent good money for a BionX system and it is still in

</I>&gt;<i> BionX.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your dealer should be able to have the warranty wheel come back in the
</I>&gt;<i> same size as your own. If you have laced a 26&quot; wheel into a 20&quot; hub
</I>&gt;<i> you have a speed problem as the 20&quot; version and the 26&quot; versions have
</I>&gt;<i> different RPM characteristics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on your description of the problem I strongly suspect a problem
</I>&gt;<i> not in the wheel but in the control console. Some systems made about
</I>&gt;<i> the time you bough yours have experienced similar problems. It might
</I>&gt;<i> even require having the whole system (motor, battery and control
</I>&gt;<i> console) components sent back to BionX for evaluation and repair.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This system is too much of an investment (and too good a system) to
</I>&gt;<i> remain on the shelf. At least if you have it repaired you can recoup
</I>&gt;<i> some of your investment if you choose a different system because it is
</I>&gt;<i> in high demand and holds its value well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will be hard to find a more suitable system or a lighter system
</I>&gt;<i> that your PL-350 (though there are some light ones available none have
</I>&gt;<i> quite the &quot;package&quot; of the PL-350). One challenge to overcome might be
</I>&gt;<i> how/where you mounted the batteries. This can affect overall trike
</I>&gt;<i> balance and/or handling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your dealer (always your first step) is not able to resolve these
</I>&gt;<i> issues under warranty please feel free to send me your serial numbers
</I>&gt;<i> off-list and I will see what I can do regarding BionX service
</I>&gt;<i> replacements.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago for
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wife.  I got what info I could from internet sources to make a decision.
</I>&gt;<i>  No
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time.   I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encouraged that I had made the right decision  when I saw that Wizwheelz
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but now
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't see this option on their web site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Problems are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is disconnected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; throttle when running too slow.   Recently, got into mode running at
</I>&gt;<i> 18mph,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. It is a complete system.  Not too difficult to install on the TT-3.6
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even though it was never designed for this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster riders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do not like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Heavy.   Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy.   Weight bias
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rear.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Poor customer service from the factory.  They mostly do not answer
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inquiries.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20&quot; wheel the space between rim and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire
</I>&gt;<i> pump.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. See problems above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distance.  The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remains.  I think the battery was replaced twice.  A new motor was sent
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 26&quot; wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20&quot; rim.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time ago. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; customers had problems.  After a while the Bion-X factory became too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this
</I>&gt;<i> message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after I had already purchased one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems with BionX.  I seem to be the only one experiencing the system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;lock-up&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the drive-train
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the trike without doing a lot of custom work.   I realize that with these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub.  Also,
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you can
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a hub motor.  Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.
