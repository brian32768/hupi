<PRE>Have people tried one of the motors that drives through the gears (like 
Cyclone, or the Elation here is Australia)? Seems that would take a lot 
of the essential compromise out of using a hub motor, esp. on a vehicle 
that naturally used a wider speed range than a conventional bicycle. My 
own experience with hub motors, and that of others I've talked to, is 
that they're almost never in the right gear - they're either overrunning 
or struggling.

&gt;<i> Generally, mounting a hub motor at front on a delta sounds like a good idea. Small wheels are even better, as you get more torque from the hub motor that way and generally can use a smaller motor. Well, the motor does not deliver more torque, but you get what I mean. You just have to see that the speed is right so that the bike/trike does not become too slow for your needs. The speed of the motor can be controlled by several ways, either by its construction electrically, or by gearing inside the hub (in case it is a geared hub motor), or by voltage applied. The right choice requires knowledge and insight about electrical motors and batteries ratings etc.
