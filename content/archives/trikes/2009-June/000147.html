I have tried both through gears (Cyclone) and hubmotor. With a motor through the gears you can get the job done with much less power and a much smaller and lighter motor, but it is harder to mount and the gearing and chain takes away some of the efficiency. 

Direct drive hub motors are nice because they are very quiet, easy to mount and use, reliable and they are very efficient at the sweet spot which can make up for the lower efficiency at lower speeds. 

The best of two worlds is probably geared hub motors. They make use of a reduction gear inside to get higher torque and/or a lighter motor for the same power. At the same time, they get a bit less peak efficiency because of the gearing. 

It is often best to keep the speed near the average speed that one tends to use. If that is 25 km/h, for example, I see no use of a hub motor that tops out at 50 km/h, and a hub motor that is good at maintaining 25 km/h and that is selected properly will probably be ok for most situations. But you will need a larger and stronger hub motor to compensate for a through-the-gears system.

Most that complain about electric assist expect it to behave like a moped or motorbike and not as an assisted bicycle. To, me, that is not assist anymore.
