<PRE>We were the Bionx distributor for Australia, but after having a number 
of problems, we stopped buying and selling them.

We had problems with the motor casings - three broke.
Also had problems with the battery packs and the consoles.

In fact we have six motors left, but only one working console
left, after the rest were given to customers with console problems.

The main problem we had with Bionx is they failed to answer 
our emails for service after the 2nd casing broke.

So I would suggest that the problem is in your console.

I've been using the Cyclone motor as power assist on my own trike,
and it has worked very well see GS Newsletter 11 for details.

However after one battery failure and a visit to Taiwan, the next
time I ordered, they claimed that they were out of stock, and 
&quot;The price will be much more when you order less than 
30,000USD each time from now.&quot;

So we ordered the motors from another supplier, who gave much 
better service, and we now have some laser cut brackets for fitting.

I think if you wanted to keep using the Bionx, and can't get another 
console, it might be worth trying a different controller, as the Bionx
is the only system which provides regeneration. It is also quite
easy to re-program the console for different wheel sizes, or to
disable the speed governor. I've ordered a couple of consoles via 
my USA distributor, who also claims their service is poor.....

They have some electronics in the motor, some in the battery pack 
and some in the console. So it might be possible to relpace the lot with
a much simpler type of controller.

I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X.  I
installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago for my
wife.  I got what info I could from internet sources to make a decision.  No
one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time.   I was
encouraged that I had made the right decision  when I saw that Wizwheelz
offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but now I
don't see this option on their web site.

Problems are:
The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is disconnected.
Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8 minutes to
reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using the
throttle when running too slow.   Recently, got into mode running at 18mph,
and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.

Like about BionX
1. It is a complete system.  Not too difficult to install on the TT-3.6 --
even though it was never designed for this.
2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster riders.

Do not like about BionX
1. Heavy.   Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy.   Weight bias to
rear.
2. Poor customer service from the factory.  They mostly do not answer e-mail
inquiries.
3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20&quot; wheel the space between rim and
motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire pump.
4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
4. See problems above.

Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering the
distance.  The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the problem
remains.  I think the battery was replaced twice.  A new motor was sent with
26&quot; wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20&quot; rim.

I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time ago. I
believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
customers had problems.  After a while the Bion-X factory became too
difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this message
after I had already purchased one.

I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
problems with BionX.  I seem to be the only one experiencing the system
&quot;lock-up&quot; problem.

I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the drive-train of
the trike without doing a lot of custom work.   I realize that with these
systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub.  Also, most
likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you can with
a hub motor.  Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.
