<PRE>The BionX warranty is 2yrs on the system and 1yr on the battery. I
suggest pressing the dealer for a full system review/replacement
because if he didn't replace the console and it is still acting up
obviously the system isn't fixed. When working correctly it is a great
system.

I have had the failure you have reported and it was traced to a faulty
control console.

They need to contact BionX service to obtain a Return Authorization.

</I>&gt;<i> they sent the same one back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are correct about the 26 vs 20 hub motor setup.&#160; I did lace it up after
</I>&gt;<i> discussing with the dealer (apparently he did not know this would be a
</I>&gt;<i> problem).&#160;&#160; I can't remember the details, but it operated very strangely --
</I>&gt;<i> so I changed back to the old motor and then the dealer finally sent the
</I>&gt;<i> correct 20&quot; wheel and motor assembly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My wife had such a bad experience with the BionX system on a recent trip
</I>&gt;<i> that she said to remove it from the trike.&#160; But after the first ride without
</I>&gt;<i> it, she realized that as troublesome as it is; it is better than no assist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what to think about the warranty now.&#160; Since it has been about
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5yrs since the original purchase, I figured the warranty was gone.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps since it has never worked properly, I can use that argument for
</I>&gt;<i> extending the warranty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mounted the battery transversely, immediately behind the seat on the
</I>&gt;<i> frame.&#160; Considering my wife's riding style I don't think that weight
</I>&gt;<i> distribution is a problem.&#160; Mounting the battery on the top of the boom
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to be too obtrusive and the ground clearance underneath the boom did
</I>&gt;<i> not look adequate.&#160; I have seen a WW Tour with the battery mounted on the
</I>&gt;<i> back of the seat and to one side, but I did not like this because the CG was
</I>&gt;<i> higher and offset compared to what I had done
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will contact the dealer again, and see what can be done first.&#160; I
</I>&gt;<i> suggested a few times to the dealer to do a full system change-over, but
</I>&gt;<i> they never agreed to this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will admit that when the BionX operates properly, it is a worthwhile
</I>&gt;<i> system.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Considering you spent good money for a BionX system and it is still in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> warranty I strongly suggest having the system made &quot;as good as new&quot; by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BionX.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your dealer should be able to have the warranty wheel come back in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same size as your own. If you have laced a 26&quot; wheel into a 20&quot; hub
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have a speed problem as the 20&quot; version and the 26&quot; versions have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different RPM characteristics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Based on your description of the problem I strongly suspect a problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not in the wheel but in the control console. Some systems made about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time you bough yours have experienced similar problems. It might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even require having the whole system (motor, battery and control
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> console) components sent back to BionX for evaluation and repair.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This system is too much of an investment (and too good a system) to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remain on the shelf. At least if you have it repaired you can recoup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some of your investment if you choose a different system because it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in high demand and holds its value well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It will be hard to find a more suitable system or a lighter system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that your PL-350 (though there are some light ones available none have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite the &quot;package&quot; of the PL-350). One challenge to overcome might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how/where you mounted the batteries. This can affect overall trike
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> balance and/or handling.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If your dealer (always your first step) is not able to resolve these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues under warranty please feel free to send me your serial numbers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off-list and I will see what I can do regarding BionX service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replacements.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X. &#160;I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; wife. &#160;I got what info I could from internet sources to make a decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;No
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time. &#160; I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; encouraged that I had made the right decision &#160;when I saw that Wizwheelz
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; now I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; don't see this option on their web site.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Problems are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is disconnected.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; minutes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; throttle when running too slow. &#160; Recently, got into mode running at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 18mph,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Like about BionX
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1. It is a complete system. &#160;Not too difficult to install on the TT-3.6
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; --
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; even though it was never designed for this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; riders.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Do not like about BionX
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Heavy. &#160; Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy. &#160; Weight bias
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; rear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Poor customer service from the factory. &#160;They mostly do not answer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; e-mail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; inquiries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20&quot; wheel the space between rim and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; pump.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4. See problems above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; distance. &#160;The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; remains. &#160;I think the battery was replaced twice. &#160;A new motor was sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 26&quot; wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20&quot; rim.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; customers had problems. &#160;After a while the Bion-X factory became too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; after I had already purchased one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; problems with BionX. &#160;I seem to be the only one experiencing the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;lock-up&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the drive-train
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the trike without doing a lot of custom work. &#160; I realize that with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub. &#160;Also,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a hub motor. &#160;Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.
