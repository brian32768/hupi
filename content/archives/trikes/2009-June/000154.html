What bike/ trike to you have the BionX installed on?  Do you also have the
PL-350?

I have again contacted the dealer -- hope he responds...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for the replies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe that the Control Head unit has never been replaced.   I did
</I>&gt;<i> sent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it back to the dealer with the battery in one of the various exchanges,
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they sent the same one back.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You are correct about the 26 vs 20 hub motor setup.  I did lace it up
</I>&gt;<i> after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussing with the dealer (apparently he did not know this would be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem).   I can't remember the details, but it operated very strangely
</I>&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I changed back to the old motor and then the dealer finally sent the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correct 20&quot; wheel and motor assembly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My wife had such a bad experience with the BionX system on a recent trip
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that she said to remove it from the trike.  But after the first ride
</I>&gt;<i> without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it, she realized that as troublesome as it is; it is better than no
</I>&gt;<i> assist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what to think about the warranty now.  Since it has been
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.5yrs since the original purchase, I figured the warranty was gone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps since it has never worked properly, I can use that argument for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extending the warranty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I mounted the battery transversely, immediately behind the seat on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frame.  Considering my wife's riding style I don't think that weight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribution is a problem.  Mounting the battery on the top of the boom
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seemed to be too obtrusive and the ground clearance underneath the boom
</I>&gt;<i> did
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not look adequate.  I have seen a WW Tour with the battery mounted on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back of the seat and to one side, but I did not like this because the CG
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; higher and offset compared to what I had done
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will contact the dealer again, and see what can be done first.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggested a few times to the dealer to do a full system change-over, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they never agreed to this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will admit that when the BionX operates properly, it is a worthwhile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Considering you spent good money for a BionX system and it is still in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; warranty I strongly suggest having the system made &quot;as good as new&quot; by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; BionX.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Your dealer should be able to have the warranty wheel come back in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; same size as your own. If you have laced a 26&quot; wheel into a 20&quot; hub
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you have a speed problem as the 20&quot; version and the 26&quot; versions have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; different RPM characteristics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Based on your description of the problem I strongly suspect a problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not in the wheel but in the control console. Some systems made about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the time you bough yours have experienced similar problems. It might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; even require having the whole system (motor, battery and control
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; console) components sent back to BionX for evaluation and repair.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This system is too much of an investment (and too good a system) to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; remain on the shelf. At least if you have it repaired you can recoup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some of your investment if you choose a different system because it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in high demand and holds its value well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It will be hard to find a more suitable system or a lighter system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that your PL-350 (though there are some light ones available none have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; quite the &quot;package&quot; of the PL-350). One challenge to overcome might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; how/where you mounted the batteries. This can affect overall trike
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; balance and/or handling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If your dealer (always your first step) is not able to resolve these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; issues under warranty please feel free to send me your serial numbers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; off-list and I will see what I can do regarding BionX service
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; replacements.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X.
</I>&gt;<i>  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; for my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; wife.  I got what info I could from internet sources to make a
</I>&gt;<i> decision.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;  No
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time.   I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; encouraged that I had made the right decision  when I saw that
</I>&gt;<i> Wizwheelz
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; now I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; don't see this option on their web site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Problems are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; minutes to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; throttle when running too slow.   Recently, got into mode running at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 18mph,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. It is a complete system.  Not too difficult to install on the
</I>&gt;<i> TT-3.6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; even though it was never designed for this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; riders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Do not like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Heavy.   Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy.   Weight
</I>&gt;<i> bias
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; rear.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Poor customer service from the factory.  They mostly do not answer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; inquiries.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20&quot; wheel the space between rim
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; pump.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 4. See problems above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; distance.  The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the
</I>&gt;<i> problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; remains.  I think the battery was replaced twice.  A new motor was
</I>&gt;<i> sent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 26&quot; wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20&quot; rim.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time
</I>&gt;<i> ago.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; customers had problems.  After a while the Bion-X factory became too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; after I had already purchased one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; problems with BionX.  I seem to be the only one experiencing the
</I>&gt;<i> system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;lock-up&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the
</I>&gt;<i> drive-train
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; the trike without doing a lot of custom work.   I realize that with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub.
</I>&gt;<i>  Also,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; a hub motor.  Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.
