<PRE>We have a Kettwiesel, some Anuras, and we have temporary possession  
of a Sun X3 and have recently arranged for a couple of Sun EZ-3's to  
get to some folks who needed them, with us trying them out on the  
way.  Our tadpole collection includes a Greenspeed GTO and some Cab- 
Bikes.  We have rented several other tadpoles for multi-day tours  
(Catrike, GT-3, Scorpion) and test-ridden a lot of others.

I don't really notice a difference in speed, but our physical  
conditioning has changed (improved) over this time, and of course the  
amount of luggage varies a lot.

It's true that it's easier to transport luggage with the standard  
racks on tadpoles, but the new Anura rack will hold one standard  
pannier, and we have been using a trailer behind the Kettwiesel.

In the last week, I've ridden to work on both the Greenspeed GTO and  
an Anura.  It really feels much better in traffic to be a little  
higher up on the delta.

We have been happy touring on trails with the tadpoles, but on roads  
with traffic, we really prefer the deltas.  Besides, you can hook the  
deltas together.
