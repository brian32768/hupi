<PRE>Yes, Giles, I've found putting the motor through the gears is more
efficient, and gives you a much wider speed range.

However there is a temptation to use the extra power to increase
one's top speed, as well as having assistance with the hills, and
this conciderably shortens one's range! Simply because the power
requirement varies as the CUBE of the speed.

For details of my set up, please see :-

Have people tried one of the motors that drives through the gears (like 
Cyclone, or the Elation here is Australia)? Seems that would take a lot 
of the essential compromise out of using a hub motor, esp. on a vehicle 
that naturally used a wider speed range than a conventional bicycle. My 
own experience with hub motors, and that of others I've talked to, is 
that they're almost never in the right gear - they're either overrunning 
or struggling.
