<PRE>Interesting that they are using an external controller for the Cyclone motor.

The normal Cyclone controller within the motor limits the amps to 30 amps.

The company who supplied us with the motors, and used the motors on their
own trikes, said that with heavy use, the motor magnets de-magnatized.
I have not had any problems with de-magnatization, but I've only
been using the internal controllers and 24 volts (max 26.5 volts) which
restricts to input to about 800 watts.  

If you want power assistance on your GTC, I would suggest the German
Hienxmann hub motor which can be bought in a number of different 
gear box and and power configerations.

We are now working on a dedicated assited trike, using the Cyclone motor
with automatic transmission.

Subject: Power assist


My wife is looking for a power assist velo for negotiating some steep hills
on her commute.  (We have pretty much given up on adding anything to her
GTC.)  Lightfootcycles has some nifty coroplast shells made to fit their
deltas.  For power assist they use Bionix but also a proprietary chain drive
that, because of recent negative comments about Bionix, looks more
interesting.

Has anyone any experience with this?

</I>&gt;<i> I think if you wanted to keep using the Bionx, and can't get another

</I>&gt;<i> my USA distributor, who also claims their service is poor.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They have some electronics in the motor, some in the battery pack

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [trikes] replacement for Bion-X
</I>&gt;<i> To: &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/trikes">trikes at bikelist.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Message-ID:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/trikes">2a9f18440906221312r6327015bwf3eaf507d2386b9 at mail.gmail.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am looking for a replacement for pedal-assist unit made by Bion-X.  I
</I>&gt;<i> installed the 350 watt unit on a Wizwheelz TT-3.6 about 1.5 years ago for
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> wife.  I got what info I could from internet sources to make a decision.
</I>&gt;<i>  No
</I>&gt;<i> one in my area (Raleigh, NC) sold pedal-assist at the time.   I was
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged that I had made the right decision  when I saw that Wizwheelz
</I>&gt;<i> offered the Bion-X as on option on their Tour model a while back, but now I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see this option on their web site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problems are:
</I>&gt;<i> The system locks-up and cannot be reset unless battery is disconnected.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes it resets within a minute, but it can take as long as 8 minutes
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> reset. The lock-up, I think, is caused by an overload -- perhaps using the
</I>&gt;<i> throttle when running too slow.   Recently, got into mode running at 18mph,
</I>&gt;<i> and there was no control for several minutes -- quite dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It is a complete system.  Not too difficult to install on the TT-3.6 --
</I>&gt;<i> even though it was never designed for this.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It does mostly function as indicated -- when working correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Regen mode actually does charge the battery.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The ability to set differing levels of assist.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. It will get you up some hills and allow keeping up with faster riders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do not like about BionX
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Heavy.   Lifting the trike onto a carrier is not easy.   Weight bias to
</I>&gt;<i> rear.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Poor customer service from the factory.  They mostly do not answer
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail
</I>&gt;<i> inquiries.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Hub motor is so large that for a 20&quot; wheel the space between rim and
</I>&gt;<i> motor makes it very awkward to use a pressure gauge or a typical tire pump.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Drag caused by hub motor -- even with system off.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. See problems above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Purchased from a dealer in Utah who has been very helpful considering the
</I>&gt;<i> distance.  The battery and hub motor have been replaced and the problem
</I>&gt;<i> remains.  I think the battery was replaced twice.  A new motor was sent
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> 26&quot; wheel -- so I got stuck having to move the motor to a 20&quot; rim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I remember that Ian of Greenspeed commented on the BionX some time ago. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe he said Greenspeed were selling the units as an accessory, but
</I>&gt;<i> customers had problems.  After a while the Bion-X factory became too
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to deal with, and they no longer sell them -- I saw this message
</I>&gt;<i> after I had already purchased one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen other reports on e-motor assist forums indicating numerous
</I>&gt;<i> problems with BionX.  I seem to be the only one experiencing the system
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lock-up&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to find a unit where the motor coupled into the drive-train of
</I>&gt;<i> the trike without doing a lot of custom work.   I realize that with these
</I>&gt;<i> systems the regen feature is gone if you keep the freewheel hub.  Also,
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> likely there is no way to provide differing levels of assist as you can
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> a hub motor.  Maybe I am wrong on this -- let me know.
