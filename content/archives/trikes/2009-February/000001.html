<PRE>&quot;Frankentrike&quot;? &quot;Trikenstien&quot;? &quot;Mosquito on steroids&quot;?
Do any of these quirky terms sound familiar to you? I used them to describe you unusual  home creation with all 26&quot; wheels! Now I need your help! Old PC crashed and lost everything saved.

Please respond! On or off list. Notice nobody posts anymore?

During a ride around 'my' lakepark, met an older gentleman who was in a power-chair/scooter/hove-around. Said he liked my DragonFlyer and wanted one to work out his left leg/arm. Little use due to a stroke. Told him about price and backed off. Is 72, used to drive an 18 wheeler, told him about my hobby. Can arc weld but said he 'loves' to braze as it is much easier to him. Has no tools and lives in apartment with wife. Here is my plan.
Am willing to measure, cut, miter, jig up, donate all and &quot;allow&quot; him to make his own joints. Why, you may ask. Just can't make myself to buy $1500 insurance! I believe he can make his own frame for his personal use, so no problem with liability.
Wants to make his with seat no lower then his knees, not sure about narrowness to push thru apartment door.
Thanks for anyone (or original poster) who replys.

Sincerely,    Leo Roderick Guajardo, 11            in Dallas
