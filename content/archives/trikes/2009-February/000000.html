<PRE>Go to this URL and check out the racing events.  there are always trikes at 
them, a number of varieties as well as homebuilt ones.  Not all the events 
are listed, but they generally have one 2 day event every month in the 
northern states Starting in April.

&gt;<i> Hi Folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just got this note, and wonder if anybody here would like to share 
</I>&gt;<i> their trike.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a TV/Video producer, and I was interested in talking to you about  my 
</I>&gt;<i> newest project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In April of 2009, I'm setting out on an Un-Road Trip.  For ten weeks,  I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> going to explore the United States and zig-zag through as many  states as 
</I>&gt;<i> I can using every mode of transportation- except for car.   I'll document 
</I>&gt;<i> the entire journey online through photos and short  documentary videos as 
</I>&gt;<i> I travel by foot, bike, train, dog sled,  biplane, kayak, moped, 
</I>&gt;<i> horseback, and whatever else I can think of.   I'll certainly achieve a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;greener&quot; trip by avoiding the favored mode  of transportation, (and 
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully discover some interesting  alternative modes of transportation), 
</I>&gt;<i> but I also think it will thrust  me into unique situations and introduce 
</I>&gt;<i> me to people  and places that  the standard road-tripper would simply 
</I>&gt;<i> drive past.  Through  unroadtrip.com, people will be able to follow the 
</I>&gt;<i> trip in real-time  and interact with the journey; suggesting modes of 
</I>&gt;<i> transportation or  offering a couch to sleep on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recently learned about various HPV projects online, and I'm very 
</I>&gt;<i> interested in including vehicles like yours as part of this  journey. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be on the road from mid-April through June, and I  would love to 
</I>&gt;<i> schedule something during that time.   Let me know what  you think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've put together two short videos to give you a better feel for the 
</I>&gt;<i> trip:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This one explains the premise - <A HREF="http://www.vimeo.com/1813012">http://www.vimeo.com/1813012</A>

</I>&gt;<i> This is a trailer narrated by Matt Lauer - <A HREF="http://www.vimeo.com/2210503">http://www.vimeo.com/2210503</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I look forward to hearing from you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
