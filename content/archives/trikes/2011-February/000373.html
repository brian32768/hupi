Sorry, I talked about this with Alex off-list and I should have
written everyone especially so the list admins would know details.

I have tried out GoogleGroups with other projects and don't like it. I
prefer to continue with mailman.

I intend to ramp up some projects at HuPI.org over the next months. I
am planning on moving the hpv lists to hupi.org.

I am in the process of setting up a new server for HuPI.org that can
handle more traffic. It will probably be at tektonic.net which worked
well for ihpva.org/whpva.org before I backed out of that fray.

Other than the domain name changing AGAIN... (what is this the 4th
time?) sticking with mailman should make the move relatively painless.
Archives are always a problem but they can continue to live at
bikelist.org at least for now.

Thanks Moz and Bob for offering hosting space. Thanks also to the list
admins for their continued support.

Brian
