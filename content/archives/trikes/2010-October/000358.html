<PRE>I agree with Ian. I spent a few hours recently in shop selling equipment for
disabled people and wasn't very impressed by the standard of the
non-motorised equipment. That said, I haven't seen the equipment the OP is
talking about - but the shop I was in was very successful and was selling
what purported to be top equipment.

In my biased opinion all these machines are compromised against normal
bicycles from an efficiency and performance point of view.

For a start you have only one person providing the motive power, so that the
non-active person is deprived of exercise, and the other person is
overworked. Then you have the increase in weight and drag over a couple of
bikes. And finally terrible road holding, handling and balance compared to a
bicycle.

This is why we have built recumbent tandem trikes, where one rider has hand
cranks, and the other foot cranks.
These machines have performance that is on a par, or better than standard
bikes. Plus the stability is better than ordinary bikes. 

With such a machine, Karen Darke and her partner toured New Zealand and the
Himalayas.

</I>There are several commercial machines available which are similar to this,
where the wheelchair front and the 'cycle' rear can be split so the
wheelchair can be used separately (in cafes etc) - however, the wheelchair
part is much sturdier than a wheelchair, as it has to withstand the higher
speeds of cycling - from my recollection of these sorts of machines, the
steering pivot is slightly in front of the front wheel centres - to provide
some trail and (presumably) damping to the steering.

Have you looked for this sort of machine on the web - a good starting point
is the Velovision Special Needs Cycling Guide at
