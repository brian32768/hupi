At the risk of joining the chorus, that's been my experience. The
dedicated wheelchairs are usually good, but anything bicycle-like is
usually quite amateur. Which leads wheelchair racers to be quite
disparaging of the pedal-powered stuff, and rightly so. But get them
onto something half decent and they usually change their minds. For
that matter, recumbent gear is usually priced like wheelchair gear.
