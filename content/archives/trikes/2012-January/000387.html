<PRE>Hi Mike,

Erm, we weren't talking cars, we were talking turn of the millennium Hope cycle hydraulics that have been sat in a shed for the last half of that.

The same problem exists with some cycle hydraulic brakes - Hayes are the tricksy ones I've owned using hazardous fluids where as all other brands I've owned have had more 'user friendly' blood.

Either way, the advice holds - first line of attack is to let the local specialists do the job - they'll get the brakes cleaned and serviced more quickly than Fran or I will be able to do at home, with specialist parts such as replacement seals and the fluids &amp; service kit with correct fittings, and all probably for little more than the cost of an eat-in snack as they do the work. Having chatted with Fran in the past I don't think brake servicing would be a job she'd actively want to take on herself. I do the same with the hydraulic stuff myself - every trike seems to have a different brand/model of brake and the local guy has the service kit to hand and the livelihood to maintain.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Fran,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm trying to remember what I use on the Hope brakes - I think it is just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> light mineral oil - the bottle I have to hand is actually Singer sewing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine oil. This job is most easily done by a bike shop tho - I don't like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjusting the hydraulic brakes if I don't have to. A local mountain bike
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shop should be able to work the brakes for you for maybe $20 - they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just the same as mountain bike brakes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd expect the Rohloff &amp; Schlumpf to just need some exercise... As long as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they had oil coverage when they went away then I'd hope for them still to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be sealed and ready to go. A routine oil change on both would be a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> precaution but I'd give them a try first. You might have more problems with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the drive chain though, depending on the conditions around where the bike
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has been stored - sometimes they rust solid if they weren't well protected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before being put away.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good luck!
