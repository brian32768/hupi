<PRE>Hi Fran,

I'm trying to remember what I use on the Hope brakes - I think it is just light mineral oil - the bottle I have to hand is actually Singer sewing machine oil. This job is most easily done by a bike shop tho - I don't like adjusting the hydraulic brakes if I don't have to. A local mountain bike shop should be able to work the brakes for you for maybe $20 - they are just the same as mountain bike brakes.

I'd expect the Rohloff &amp; Schlumpf to just need some exercise... As long as they had oil coverage when they went away then I'd hope for them still to be sealed and ready to go. A routine oil change on both would be a good precaution but I'd give them a try first. You might have more problems with the drive chain though, depending on the conditions around where the bike has been stored - sometimes they rust solid if they weren't well protected before being put away.

Good luck!

Rob

</I>&gt;<i> This trike has been sitting for years and the brake levers close all the way. Over the years I have let out I think 1drop of fluid a couple times as the brakes froze up in the heat of the building I store it in. I would think maybe it needs more fluid but does anyone know what kind and where to get it. I know the Rohloff needs changing and I have that but what about the Schlumph Mountain Drive. It only has about 25 miles on it but has about 11 years of just sitting waiting to be ridden. Any help -suggestions is greatly appreciated. Fran .
