<PRE>Magura doesn't say that other brake fluids will be a problem, only that
they are fans of mineral oil.

I have had DOT 5.0 in my early GTO with Hopes for nearly 10 years now.
 FWIW, the same fluid.  DOT 5.0 is the silicon oil that was developed for
antique cars and intended to be non-corrosive (won't damage pretty paint)
and non-reactive/long lasting - at the expense of expanding more and giving
a somewhat less solid feel.  I am not sure, but I think epoxy powder coast
may be pretty immune to DOT 3, 4, 5.1 fluids,  Probably polyurethane paints
don't care - I never see any damage to my autos when I am sloppy.  It will
tear up a nice lacquer paint job though.

I always bleed out and replace all the DOT 3 fluid in used cars I buy (to
remove any accumulate moisture that does cause steel parts to deteriorate,
fouls the fluid, and ruins the wheel cylinders), but I don't know anyone
else that does so.  Nothing unusual about buying a 10 to 20 year old car
with original DOT 3 in it. Water fouled fluid doesn't do much to aluminum
and stainless steel.

Not to be argumentative though it must seem so at this point, the Magura
verbage sounds like marketing hype.   I still wonder what materials they
actually use for their elastomeric parts and about their compatibility.
