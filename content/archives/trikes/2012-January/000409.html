Well. not sure if I should say this, but that has not been my 
experience - my first recumbent (in 1995) was a Peer Gynt which has 
Magura hydraulic rim brakes.

This is a long wheel base under-seat steering (2 wheel) recumbent - 
when you fall on it (as I did a few times, mainly after I put on SPD 
pedals) the first bit you land on is the nut which holds the hydraulic 
hose in the brake lever on the handlebar on the side you fall on - this 
does not appear to do anything, but the next time the brakes is 
applied, the fluid squirts out -  so I had to top up the fluid - as far 
as I can remember, once for the front brake and  3 times for the back 
brake - and I used 'DOT 4&quot; fluid (I still have the bottle - which says 
'fluid will damage paint work&quot;) as the first time it happened I was 
with my brother who trained as a car mechanic so he went to the nearest 
garage and bought the bottle of fluid (neither of us knew that mineral 
oil is what is supposed to be used in Magura hydraulics).

The brakes must have done at least  14,000 miles after the various 
refillings over 7 years or so and continued to work - now the front 
brake is probably mainly filled with the original mineral oil, but the 
back brake lost quite a lot of fluid each time I fell, so must be 
almost all DOT 4 fluid.

Maybe I have just been lucky - I still have the Peer Gynt but have not 
ridden it since 2003 as I now mainly ride trikes, but if I ever use it 
again I will have doubts about the brakes.
