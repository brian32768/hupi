<PRE>Hi Rob,

If you were to put mineral oil in a car brake system there would be
no assurance that the components and seals would have the expected
performance or life expectancy.

A designer of a modern braking system would most likely (to avoid liability
issues) select materials to go with the glycol ether and polydimethylsiloxane
that are typically used.  These should be OK if mixed together.  If you are
still in the business of selling and servicing trikes, you might want to
consider using approved brake fluids just to CYA.

Mineral oil was common in decades past; it is no longer considered a
quality brake fluid.  There is also an additive package blended with DOT X
fluids that extend their performance and life.

Food grade mineral oil will have no additives to prolong life, and all
mineral oils are fragile in comparison to the common brake fluids when
exposed to air and heat.  They quickly form polymeric sludges when abused.
  FWIW, I am currently working with an apparatus using mineral oil at 400F,
so the specifications are fresh in my mind.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> precaution but I'd give them a try first. You might have more problems with
</I>&gt;<i> the drive chain though, depending on the conditions around where the bike
</I>&gt;<i> has been stored - sometimes they rust solid if they weren't well protected

</I>&gt;<i> the brakes froze up in the heat of the building I store it in. I would
</I>&gt;<i> think maybe it needs more fluid but does anyone know what kind and where to

</I>&gt;<i> the Schlumph Mountain Drive. It only has about 25 miles on it but has about
</I>&gt;<i> 11 years of just sitting waiting to be ridden. Any help -suggestions is
</I>&gt;<i> greatly appreciated. Fran .
