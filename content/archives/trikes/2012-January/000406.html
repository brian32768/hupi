Also Magura was using mineral oil in their rim brakes dating back to  
the 1980's so they already had experience with seals for it before  
they started making disc brakes in the 1990's. Someone told me Magura  
and Shimano use mineral oil due to strict laws about toxics in  
consumer products in Germany and Japan but I don't have any  
verification of that.
