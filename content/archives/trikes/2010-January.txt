Message-ID: <4B3F78E2.6030606@zalonoffice.com>

I have a Greenspeed  GTO, and every time the temperature dips below 30? 
(F!), my cables freeze. First, the d?railleurs get cranky (Oh, I didn't 
intend to be funny!), and then slowly stop working at all. Then, the 
brakes refuse to release. Bummer when I'm a distance from home.

Does anyone have any great ideas about how to resolve the problem?

Thanks and Happy New Year!

I think you should probably disassemble and clean/lube them. There are other options but I expect when you take them apart, you're going to find they,re rusty/corroded.

Hi Jules,

I found good quality cables with continuous PTFE liners fixed this problem - this keeps out the moisture which can then freeze.
Gore Ride-On are maybe the leading brand but at the highest price. I have successfully used Nokon and SRAM Flak Jacket. 
Look in the mountain bike section of your preferred bike shop/web site.

And, at least here in the UK where temps only drop a few degrees below freezing, hydraulic disc brakes do not seem to suffer from this problem - I'm assured they're good to at least -10C.

The no-cost solution is to ensure the trike is kept in a damp and condensation free environment - but this isn't always practical if it is your daily commuter!!!

Jules,

Most likely there is a low spot in your cable where some water has collected
a little at a time.  Upright bikes usually have less complicated cable
routing that starts high and ends low - so they rarely collect water- that
is why it is a surprise to most people when it happens.  Knowing this you
can probably guess where the cables have frozen and brake it up by flexing.
Best of all just dissemble them, wipe the cable, and blow compressed air
through the housing.  It is unlikely you will have a quick recurrence unless
you ride in a downpour.

Rob is right on as always recommending the PTFE lined housings.  I prefer
the rolled or drawn flat cables like SLIK.  This type of cable have the
strands flattened so there is more surface contact for less contact
pressure, lower wear, and smoother movement.  I also like to grease my cable
with a PTFE containting grease.  It is almost a slick as an oil lube and it
doesn't migrate around so it takes up space that water could infiltrate (or
so I imagine).

Hi Bob,
 
Following your advice, I have been testing with plastic soft drink bottles.
They are working fabulously - the lack of a rubber internal dividing
membrane seems to make no difference. 
 
The damping is better able to be adjusted, as the opening into the soft
drink bottle is larger than the openings into the pressure accumulator I was
using. And of course, the bottles cost nothing and are 1/10th the weight of
the accumulators! Also, the lack of a need to bleed the system, use two
filling points, etc, is excellent. 
 
The 'wooshing squishes' of water shooting in and out of the bottles is
interesting, but that occurs audibly only on the largest of bumps. 
 
At least I now have a system I can extensively test. 
 
Thank you.
 
Regards,
 
Julian Edgar

The rubber is to prevent slow loss of air through the flowing water.
Presumably, one could bubble air up into a bottle, and let the water in the
system reach saturation.  A bleed valve could probably be installed at the
top end of the tank for convenience, but the savings would be ounces against
hours, I guess.

Yes that's so, Bob. Trouble is, the accumulators need a rubber membrane

Hi Jules,
If your wrench isn't used to recumbents he might not have seen the problem before - it is usually a problem of water collecting at the low point of a cable loop - either from rain, road spray or condensation. Stick bikes cable runs tend not to have these loops at the lowest point for moisture to accumulate and so they drain naturally. 
Sealed cables, either as Phil suggest using lube, or as I mentioned using PTFE liners, fixes the problem.

If you are going to the expense of the work I'd strongly recommend the lined cables but I suspect the tech used by each cable brand is pretty much the same... I think I paid GBP20 (US$30?) for my last set of Flak Jacket gear cables and GBP10 (US$15) for Nokon (a very special offer - they seem to be 4x dearer now) both of which I've been happy with.

Good luck!
Rob

Hey guys,

I guess I am hard up for cycling time.........I decided to re-string my 
seat fabric on my Greenspeed GTR.  It needs to be tightened, 
straightened, and I need something to do.

I have been VERY happy with my Greenspeed overall, but I was 
disappointed in how the seat fabric was attached.  The metal grommets 
hit the horizontal seat frame pieces, and have ground gouges into the 
paint/metal.  I noticed online that other GTR's have the fabric sliced 
so that the grommets do not touch the metal frame.  This probably also 
helps against the fabric sliding and slipping over time.

I cleaned and touched up the gouges last night with some of the touchup 
paint that came with the trike (sweet) and am going to restring the seat.

How far is the fabric cut on your seat mesh?

Also, there are some small bumps and rough texture under the paint on 
the horizontal seat frame pieces.  Is it starting to rust or is it just 
not finished as smoothly as the rest of the trike?  I can send links to 
pics if needed.

Thanks,
Chris

Sounds like your seat is too small - there should be plenty of overlap 
and the brass grommets should be nowhere near any steel. You could whip 
up a new one on a sewing machine, or else slip in a bit of fabric to 
keep the metal bits apart.

More overlap means a stiffer seat, as there is less bungy cord to 
stretch. that way it won't fret on the paint as much.

Thanks Giles,

I cut the fabric, and the grommets are mostly not touching steel now.  A 
couple are close.  I could make them further but I didn't want to cut 
the fabric past the hem until seeing if others are cut past the hem.

At $100+ for new fabric, I don't want to cut it too far.

Notice this persons picture shows a gap in the seat fabric where the 
horizontal supports go?

http://grothserver.princeton.edu/~groth/random_pics/bikerides/trike_20050620/TRIKE_20050620_17.htmlx

There were not gabs in mine and the grommets really ground into the 
frame.  The other GTR's I have seen all had gaps or cuts to go around 
the seat frame.  I have been very happy with my dealer and the service, 
but a few items on assembly were not quite done with the care of others 
I have seen.

You have a good point though, my fabric has an 8.5 inch gab on the back 
side......others look to be closer to 5-6 inches.  Maybe the fabric is a 
bit too small.

http://grothserver.princeton.edu/~groth/random_pics/bikerides/trike_20050620/TRIKE_20050620_18.htmlx

Those pictures are not of mine, just the first pics I found on google of 
greenspeed seats from the underside.

Thanks for the input,
Chris

Hi Chris,
               The eyelets should NOT touch the seat frame. How this
has occured I don't know. Maybe you could send me some photos
so I could see why this has occured and we can prevent it from
happening again.

The latter GTOs which have the Ergo seats have the fabric slit so that
 the fabric follows the contours of the seat rails, whereas on the earlier
GTOs with the flat seat backs, it was not slit so that you got some
lumber support from where the seat brace was not gathering the material.

You could possibly slit the material, and when you re-lace the seat you
could cut the shock cord into a number of pieces to adjust the tension
in the cords to suit the shape of your back.

I`m using trampoline fabric, from a local manufacturer, for seats.  It`s much cheaper.

Subject: Re: [trikes] Greenspeed Seat Fabric

Thanks Giles,

I cut the fabric, and the grommets are mostly not touching steel now.  A couple are close.  I could make them further but I didn't want to cut the fabric past the hem until seeing if others are cut past the hem.

At $100+ for new fabric, I don't want to cut it too far.

Notice this persons picture shows a gap in the seat fabric where the horizontal supports go?

http://grothserver.princeton.edu/~groth/random_pics/bikerides/trike_20050620/TRIKE_20050620_17.htmlx

There were not gabs in mine and the grommets really ground into the frame.  The other GTR's I have seen all had gaps or cuts to go around the seat frame.  I have been very happy with my dealer and the service, but a few items on assembly were not quite done with the care of others I have seen.

You have a good point though, my fabric has an 8.5 inch gab on the back side......others look to be closer to 5-6 inches.  Maybe the fabric is a bit too small.

http://grothserver.princeton.edu/~groth/random_pics/bikerides/trike_20050620/TRIKE_20050620_18.htmlx

Those pictures are not of mine, just the first pics I found on google of greenspeed seats from the underside.

Thanks for the input,
Chris

Where did your old seat fabric eventually fail?  Did the bungee fail 
before the fabric, or were they about the same time.

I get it about being frugal and all that.  But I would ask Greenspeed to fix
me up with the right stuff.  You could not ask for better people to deal
with.  They will charge a fair price and no more.  They will sell you an
effective product.  They will stand behind it.  At least ask them how much
for the correct seat cover and bungee.  You will get tens of thousands of
miles from it.

I'm building my own bents and haven't had to replace seat fabric yet.  I use nylon straps and plastic tensioner, like a backpack.  I did wear a small hole in the bottom of the fabric, once, due to it being too close to the USS handlebar clamp.

The seat material wears on the lower bar. It moves as the  bungy gives over 
road bump. I noticed it at about 12000 miles or so. The powder  coating on 
the tubing begins to fade as well. I think I installed new bungy long  
before the seat material failed.

Yes, Greenspeed has good service, but they are 12000  miles away, and it is 
a very simple job.

There are plenty of US dealers.  Getting it from GS relieves one of getting
it wrong, because if you give them a chance they will get it right. No
rubbing grommets, no puny bungee material, and so on.

Plus you get to support one of the top tier trike design and manufacturing
companies.   It is not as if they are getting rich.  It is hard work selling
hand built anything.

I second Mike Ross' comments about dealing with Greenspeed. They are 
simply superb. A few years ago, the SRAM Dual Drive hub on my GTO  
failed, after less than 4,000 miles. I called SRAM and they blamed it on 
the trike, which made no sense at all. When I told this to Paul Sims, he 
immediately sent me a replacement hub and even though I offered to pay 
for it -- after all, it wasn't Greenspeed's fault -- he would not accept 
payment for it. AND I HAD PURCHASED THE GTO USED!

So not only do I love my trike, I love the company that made it too.

I find seat fabric wears pretty well too, I use the stuff that outdoor 
furniture is made from, and brass grommets. The seat is usually a simple 
rectangle. Cutting slots out for tubes, etc. in my experience leads to 
weakness.

One tip I've found - brass grommets have a smooth side and a rough side 
when they're installed. Resist the temptation to put the smooth side out 
where it can be seen - then the rough side rubs up against the 
overlapping fabric on the seat, and eventually cuts through it.

Message-ID: <002101ca9b02$f0f490c0$d2ddb240$@edgar@bigpond.com>

Hi Folks,
 
If you have an iPhone or iTouch you can buy ($6) very good software that
allows direct comparisons of ride comfort of different machines. The
software is called 'Vibration'. It measures actual  accelerations
vertically, and in pitch and roll. I take the measurements at my head. 
 
I have been comparing the ride comfort of my pneumatic / hydraulic suspended
trike ("Chalky")  against a Brompton folding bike (16 inch wheels, sprung
seat, small-travel rear suspension) and a Gazelle Medeo Plus (high quality
commuting bike, 28 inch wheels, sprung seat post, sprung front forks).
Chalky has 16 inch wheels. 
The tests were conducted at a fairly slow pace over a bumpy grass-and-dirt
surface.
http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/accelerationscompared.j
pg graphs the RMS values for accelerations in X, Y and Z planes of the three
machines over the test course.
http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/RRGazChal.jpg - shows
the actual traces for the measurements. 
I found the software very good, especially when attempting to gain best
compromises between conflicting requirements - eg reducing body roll by the
use of a stiffer anti-roll bar versus the resulting increase in the wheel
rates in one-wheel bumps. Spring rates, suspension interconnection and
damping rates were all also developed using the data.
 
Regards,
 
Julian Edgar

Differentiate the data to report the correct measurand for comfort, or its
lack - "jerk" is the term of art for the time rate of change of
acceleration.  Acceleration is not always an informative measurand for
comfort.  Acceleration can be quite comfortable - lying in bed for instance
has 1G; more than anything you have measured with your iPhoney or iTouchy.
 But the jerk is very small in bed, as opposed to on the trike.

Acceleration is a good measure of the instantaneous force on a vibrating
component. (F=ma)  Acceleration might tell you the magnitude of stress and
strain and allow you to estimate whether a part will break and help you to
optimize it.  But it is only indirectly, and in certain circumstances, an
analog for comfort.

It is the jerk that makes you bit your tongue.  (In more ways than one.)

Mike

Hi Mike,
 
Differentiation data function is available in the software, but I didn't
want to utterly confuse everyone. 
 
I have separately sent you a spreadsheet of the recorded Chalky data (you
can email it to yourself from the iPhone). 
 
Also note any DC offset is dialled out of the data. So the static 1g is not
there.
 
 
Regards,

Differentiate the data to report the correct measurand for comfort, or its
lack - "jerk" is the term of art for the time rate of change of
acceleration.  Acceleration is not always an informative measurand for
comfort.  Acceleration can be quite comfortable - lying in bed for instance
has 1G; more than anything you have measured with your iPhoney or iTouchy.
But the jerk is very small in bed, as opposed to on the trike.
 
Acceleration is a good measure of the instantaneous force on a vibrating
component. (F=ma)  Acceleration might tell you the magnitude of stress and
strain and allow you to estimate whether a part will break and help you to
optimize it.  But it is only indirectly, and in certain circumstances, an
analog for comfort.
 
It is the jerk that makes you bit your tongue.  (In more ways than one.)

Hi Folks,

If you have an iPhone or iTouch you can buy ($6) very good software that
allows direct comparisons of ride comfort of different machines. The
software is called 'Vibration'. It measures actual  accelerations
vertically, and in pitch and roll. I take the measurements at my head.

I have been comparing the ride comfort of my pneumatic / hydraulic suspended
trike ("Chalky")  against a Brompton folding bike (16 inch wheels, sprung
seat, small-travel rear suspension) and a Gazelle Medeo Plus (high quality
commuting bike, 28 inch wheels, sprung seat post, sprung front forks).
Chalky has 16 inch wheels.
The tests were conducted at a fairly slow pace over a bumpy grass-and-dirt
surface.

pg graphs the RMS values for accelerations in X, Y and Z planes of the three
machines over the test course.
http://i638.photobucket.com/albums/uu102/JulianEdgar/RRGazChal.jpg - shows
the actual traces for the measurements.
I found the software very good, especially when attempting to gain best
compromises between conflicting requirements - eg reducing body roll by the
use of a stiffer anti-roll bar versus the resulting increase in the wheel
rates in one-wheel bumps. Spring rates, suspension interconnection and
damping rates were all also developed using the data.

Julian Edgar

It isn't too confusing if you just say, "The rate at which acceleration
changes is most important for comfort.  Here is a graph of that rate of
change.  Some people call this jerk, it is a good word choice because when
you feel a jerk that is acceleration changing quickly."  And also, everyone
likes to learn a new way to use a word.

If you were looking at WHEN the accelerations are greatest that is actually
when the jerk is at its lowest. And the maxima of jerk are where the
acceleration curve is steepest, this could very well be when acceleration is
zero since that is the condition when the direction of acceleration is
changing direction.

In a way, because it is incorrect to discuss comfort as a direct function
of acceleration it is even more confusing.  You may be correct that the
systems that have the highest accelerations also have the highest jerk and
the least comfort, but it is physically not guaranteed this is so.  I can
imagine qualities of leverage and damping that make high jerk in low
acceleration conditions.

I picked this up working on the design of a roller coaster.  The transitions
from one direction to another could be visually not notable, but the "fee"l
of the transition would be all about the jerk, not the acceleration.

Well, more than 10% of people that want to work are begging for jobs and 
not getting them. And many of those that have jobs are looking at 
possible layoffs in the near future.

Subject: [trikes] short cage derailluer
Message-ID: <002401caa064$1d36b9e0$57a42da0$@edgar@bigpond.com>

As previously mentioned I have had problems with my derailleur dragging on
the ground when passing over rocks and through holes. (16 inch wheels.) 
 
Ian Sims of Greenspeed suggested fitting a short cage derailleur and a
Schlumf front drive, the latter reducing the necessity to take up so much
chain slack when running on the small front cog. 
 
I fitted a short cage derailleur but kept the front triple chainrings - and
found what perhaps lots of people already know... if you're careful in your
gear selection, you can use a 9 speed rear cluster and a three front
chainrings with a short derailleur. I just make sure that when I am on the
largest front ring, I don't change down much on the rear cogs before
dropping down a front ratio.  It's pretty easy to remember, especially when
the front cogs are right in front of you. 
 
All combinations of the smaller two front chain rings work with all
combinations of the rear gears - it's only when on the large front ring that
you need to take care. 
 
The shorter cage also seems to keep high speed gears tracking better -
perhaps the previous long cage derailleur was flexing sideways a bit with
the length of slack chain in front of it swinging from side to side?
 
I have improved the derailleur ground clearance by about 30mm.

Julian Edgar

Well Julian,
                  You are doing a lot better than me! I can NEVER remember 
NOT to use certain gear combinations. However I have found it possible
to set the chain up to reach large to large, and then all that happens if
I'm stupid enough to use small to small, is the chain drags on the ground.
Rather than not having enough chain to go large to large and then
wrecking the R/D, as I have done :-(

The short cage R/D will give a crisper change simply because it is designed
to be used with close ratio racing or road bike cassette, and the upper 
pulley should be closer to the cassette, plus with a smaller run of chain
between the two pulleys, I would expect better control of the chain.

And like you say, the swinging chain will have less leverage over the upper
R/D pivots..........

I just refreshed the old 9sp rear mech on my Greenspeed GTX with a Shimano 105 Super Short. That is a Mountain Drive/9sp 9-30 cassette setup - a couple of teeth beyond the spec of the mech but it works fine and shifting is crisp. Backpedalling in the workshop in the largest ring feels rough as the top jockey is too close but when riding with the chain under load there is no problem.

Hope that helps...

Shimano 105 Rear Derailleur 9 Speed 5501 - SS Super Short Cage Silver
<http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=2654>
c-to-c distance on rear mech jockey wheels is 55mm... 
They didn't have the longer GS version in stock when I bought.
I bought this a couple of weeks ago on sale because it met my needs [1] but it may well be older stock.
Rob

[1] only marginally dearer than a single new jockey wheel for the original one.
