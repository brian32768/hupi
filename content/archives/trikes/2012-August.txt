Subject: [trikes] Chafing Problem
Message-ID: <502D0346.4010905@zalonoffice.com>

The other day, after a fairly short 10 mile ride on my GTO, I noticed a 
chafing on my bottom, in the center, just above my sit bones. And the 
next morning, after scratching the area (because it had become itchy), I 
discovered that my underpants were extremely bloody. I have previously 
felt chafing in the same spot, but it never was this bad, and it never 
before bled.

I may have an explanation for this unpleasant condition: a year ago, the 
elastic that held the mesh seat in place broke, and I repaired it with 
some bungee cord I purchased from a sports shop. However, I don't think 
I did a great job: the mesh eventually folded over itself in a couple of 
places, INCLUDING EXACTLY WHERE THE CHAFING OCCURRED. A photo of the 
seat (showing the wrinkling) is attached.

Has anyone else had the same problem? For the time being, my "cure" is 
to cover the seat with some yoga mat rubber material . . . and it seems 
to have worked. And my next venture is to just purchase a new mesh seat. 
But I'm curious to see if anyone else has had the same problem.

Yes, and the solution for me was to re-apply the seat mesh paying much
more attention to both getting it crease-free on top and making sure there
wasn't anything poking up under the seat (I had a cable tie in a poor
location and the ~1mm edge was annoying me). With one trike I ended up
adding ties between the front of the mesh and the seat supports to stop
the mesh sliding up over time. I didn't bleed from it though.

With my rotovelo I've redone the seat padding to match the curve of my
back better (it's easy to stuff extra foam under the supplied pad), and
now that I've done that I'm thinking about putting a lower back pad
between the mesh and shock cord on my next mesh seat. It won't be as
effective as reshaping the seat supports, but it's a lot easier to do.

Personally, I feel the need for a gap between the back and the base of a seat.  The GS seat does not work for me at all. If I felt the need to try to make it work, I would think about trying to make the mesh into two pieces; back and base.

I found it was easier to just lace those parts separately. It's very easy
to pick a dividing point and end up with a knot at the front of the seat
and another at the top. I found that was especially useful on more upright
seats where the force on them is quite different.

Hi Jules,

I had a similar problem with the carbon seat on my Evo-K, but this was fixed by drilling a hole in the seat so there was no material pressing against the rub spot...
And then improved by adding a ventisit cushion.

It might be worth it to take it to a local shop that services trikes if you 
 have one nearby.  Bleeding is no fun!!!

I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem with Dura-Ace
9-Speed bar end shifters.

Story follows:
Have had my Greenspeed-GTO since 2005.  In 2010 the rear shifter was
replaced after replacing all the other rear drive components. I purchased
the shifter from a LBS (Inside Out Sports) and got it adjusted to shift OK
without too many problems.    I find that with recumbents the adjustment of
the shifter is a real pain because you cannot turn the crank and see what
is happening at the cogs at the same time -- maybe someone has a solution
for this -- I have thought of a mirror, a video camera or a small motor to
slowly turn the crank.

So, after about 50 to 100 miles of riding with everything going well the
shifter suddenly lost its indexing.  I decided to fix it after letting is
sit for a few months over the hot summer we have had in NC.  When I removed
the shifter I noticed that the plastic cover was cracked and when fully
removed the small circular indexing plate fell out in two pieces.  This
seems to explain why the indexing failed.  I went back the to the LBS and
asked if there was any warranty.  They were not too encouraging about a
warranty and did not have a new set in stock.  So I ordered a new set from
Amazon. The box and parts from Amazon appeared to be genuine Shimano.  I
found with this unit that I could not find an adjustment that would allow
good shifting for both small and large cogs.  I removed the chain and
looked at the alignment at each index point and found that the derailleur
was not stepping correctly.  Also noticed that the shifter seemed to have
10 index points rather than 9.   After several attempts to see if there was
some compromise adjustment I gave up.

 Then decided that since I did not really know what indexing Shimano was
using, I would setup a fixture to try to find out.  Clamped the shifter in
a vise and connected a short piece of housing and ran a cable which was
suspending a weight of about 8 lbs.  The value of 8 lbs was found by using
a spring scale to pull on the shifter cable with no chain -- I found that
it took about 8-10lbs to move the derailleur and about 5 lbs to hold at a
fixed position.  Then clamped a small pointer on the cable and marked the
index points with a fine pen.  I was surprised to find that there really
were 10 index points and that there was noticeable hysteresis when shifting
in opposite directions.  The inner steps were about 0.1" but the end steps
were about 0.15".  Gave up and thought about changing to SRAM Grip-Shift,
but would have to change the derailleur also.

Then about a week after contacting the LBS they said they had a new set of
shifters for warranty replacement. The first thing I did was to setup the
new shifter in the fixture I had made to compare the indexing of the unit
from Amazon.  This new shifter looked much better. The hysteresis was much
smaller and there were 9 index positions.  I still saw that the indexing at
the end points was larger at the ends.  About 0.15" for 9-8 and about 0.13"
for 1-2.  I guess this is a design feature.  So, installed this unit and
after a bit of fiddling with the adjustment was able to get shifting to
work well.

Has anyone had a similar experience?  I have always expected very high
standards from Shimano.

Bob,
One aid is a pedal stick that connects to a pedal shaft and allows you to
spin the cranks while shifting and observing the derailleurs. I use one
with my WAW velomobile.   It looks like an animal control stick.

Its a 40" piece of 1/2" ID plastic pipe with 60"of parachute cord fed
through it. The pedal end  has a small hole in the side of the pipe for the
cord. The cord is knotted so it can't slip out. The other end of the pipe
has a saw kerf slot just large enough for the cord.  In use a pedal sized
loop of cord is created at the pedal end and slipped over the pedal to the
axle. At the other end of the stick, the slack is pulled out of the cord. A
strategically located knot is slipped into the cord slot to keep the cord
under tension.

The pipe can be any length to suit your application.

Hi Bob,
Shimano bar end shifters have been sold in 8, 9 and 10sp versions... And seem to alternate between Dura Ace and Ultegra ranges. There is usually one more 'click' than the number of gears they're set up for. See Sheldon Brown for spacings for each type - perhaps you managed to get the wrong gear version (possibly wrongly marked/advertised?) and it didn't match the rest of your setup?
As the shifting mechanism moves along an arc I guess I'd expect the amount of lateral movement for a given amount of cable pull to vary, especially at the extreme limits but I've never bothered measuring it. Usually the 'end' gears are up against the rear mech stops so it isn't so critical.
When working alone, rear wheel up on chocks,  set gear and pedal up front, then go back and check - but yeah, it is easier with an assistant...

Last time I wanted to change my bar end levers I bought Shimano down tube levers for GBP30/US45...
They are a little rare but the ones I picked up had the same type of click-ring, fitted straight on to the bar end lever mounts and the levers themselves were all metal and much nicer. Watch out tho as some have curved click rings that wrap around the downtube.

When I had a derauler, I would find a helper (children can and enjoy being part of this) to turn the crank.  If you have a BB style with an internal thread, you may be able to install a long bolt, to which you attach an electric drill, to turn it, while you adjust. 
  I use an IGH (Alfine 11 speed) so it&#39;s now moot.

 For no apparent reason, several years ago the (Shimano) indexing plate on
my TT 3.4 crumbled into far more than two pieces.  Both front and rear.  I
pulled apart the bar-ends, dug out the remaining pieces and put them back
together.  I am still riding it and haven't missed the clicks.  I suppose
there is some theoretical downside to this smooth shifting, but I haven't
noticed it in practice.

Even when new, it was not easy to get all 27 gears to stay properly
indexed.  Now I can adjust to get all gears without worrying about clicks.
 It only takes a short time to become accustomed to the sound and feel of
properly shifting gears.

The TT is old and beatup enough now to need a complete overhaul this
winter.  Anyone know of better shifters - click or clickless?

Thanks to all for the responses and  the info.

The pedal stick sounds like a good solution.

Thanks for reminding me of the Sheldon Brown site -- with all the people
the world could do without, why did he have to pass-away?

The bent rider online info showed this is not an uncommon problem.  Sorry
to see that the 9-speed Dura-Ace is obsolete.

I do not remember too well,  but I think I tried to put the shifter in
friction mode when indexing broke, but it did not work well.   Really like
indexing.

Message-ID: <CAD1c=ts67dYY2nmXAQ3PCjQLAYzua0DK+PKqXtx7FVjc9mbV2g@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem with Dura-Ace
9-Speed bar end shifters.

Story follows:
Have had my Greenspeed-GTO since 2005.  In 2010 the rear shifter was
replaced after replacing all the other rear drive components. I purchased
the shifter from a LBS (Inside Out Sports) and got it adjusted to shift OK
without too many problems.    I find that with recumbents the adjustment of
the shifter is a real pain because you cannot turn the crank and see what
is happening at the cogs at the same time -- maybe someone has a solution
for this -- I have thought of a mirror, a video camera or a small motor to
slowly turn the crank.

So, after about 50 to 100 miles of riding with everything going well the
shifter suddenly lost its indexing.  I decided to fix it after letting is
sit for a few months over the hot summer we have had in NC.  When I removed
the shifter I noticed that the plastic cover was cracked and when fully
removed the small circular indexing plate fell out in two pieces.  This
seems to explain why the indexing failed.  I went back the to the LBS and
asked if there was any warranty.  They were not too encouraging about a
warranty and did not have a new set in stock.  So I ordered a new set from
Amazon. The box and parts from Amazon appeared to be genuine Shimano.  I
found with this unit that I could not find an adjustment that would allow
good shifting for both small and large cogs.  I removed the chain and
looked at the alignment at each index point and found that the derailleur
was not stepping correctly.  Also noticed that the shifter seemed to have
10 index points rather than 9.   After several attempts to see if there was
some compromise adjustment I gave up.

 Then decided that since I did not really know what indexing Shimano was
using, I would setup a fixture to try to find out.  Clamped the shifter in
a vise and connected a short piece of housing and ran a cable which was
suspending a weight of about 8 lbs.  The value of 8 lbs was found by using
a spring scale to pull on the shifter cable with no chain -- I found that
it took about 8-10lbs to move the derailleur and about 5 lbs to hold at a
fixed position.  Then clamped a small pointer on the cable and marked the
index points with a fine pen.  I was surprised to find that there really
were 10 index points and that there was noticeable hysteresis when shifting
in opposite directions.  The inner steps were about 0.1" but the end steps
were about 0.15".  Gave up and thought about changing to SRAM Grip-Shift,
but would have to change the derailleur also.

Then about a week after contacting the LBS they said they had a new set of
shifters for warranty replacement. The first thing I did was to setup the
new shifter in the fixture I had made to compare the indexing of the unit
from Amazon.  This new shifter looked much better. The hysteresis was much
smaller and there were 9 index positions.  I still saw that the indexing at
the end points was larger at the ends.  About 0.15" for 9-8 and about 0.13"
for 1-2.  I guess this is a design feature.  So, installed this unit and
after a bit of fiddling with the adjustment was able to get shifting to
work well.

Has anyone had a similar experience?  I have always expected very high
standards from Shimano.
