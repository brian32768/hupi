Subject: [trikes] Greenspeed GTE tires
Message-ID: <8CE9EBEB2223BE5-1908-DF573@webmail-d168.sysops.aol.com>

I am going to change tires on my GTE as they are dry rotting. Now the problem for me is what size. I want to go with Marathon Plus because I don't want to change any flats if possible. The tires don't have any #'s on them except 20x175. When I look for tires they have other #'s for the tire. The tires on the Ute also have a HS348 even though it says 20x175 and I don't under stand what all these mean and don't want to buy the wrong size tire. Any suggestions?? Thanks Fran

Message-ID: <8CE9EC21FF25B3A-2ABC-E978@webmail-d177.sysops.aol.com>


This trike has been sitting for years and the brake levers close all the way. Over the years I have let out I think 1drop of fluid a couple times as the brakes froze up in the heat of the building I store it in. I would think maybe it needs more fluid but does anyone know what kind and where to get it. I know the Rohloff needs changing and I have that but what about the Schlumph Mountain Drive. It only has about 25 miles on it but has about 11 years of just sitting waiting to be ridden. Any help -suggestions is greatly appreciated. Fran .

Sorry about all the question. I should know some of this but don't. The person wanting to ride my GTE is about 250 lbs. It was built for me at 176 lbs. Do you think it would be ok for him with 2 sets of panniers pulling a trailer? We are planning a long tour and trikes would be so much better then our bikes. He doesn't have one and I have plenty and thinking about riding them. Fran

It sounds like what you want is a "406-42" or something close in the
last two digits.  The 406 corresponds to the 20" diameter of your tire,
in mm.  The 42 corresponds to the 1.75" width of your tire, in mm.
There is actually a decimal point in your 175.

I knew the 406 was a 20 inch wheel but didn't know what else I needed to know before deciding on a tire size. Yes the tire said 20x 1.75. Thanks

HI Fran,

You'll want to check which of the 20" sizes you actually have.? There's 406mm, 419mm and 451mm, all of which are considered 20".? I'm guessing it's actually 20x1.75, which suggests to me that you're looking for the 406mm size.? You may want to check the actual bead seat diameter, if your rims aren't marked.? Checkout http://sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html.? You could also contact Greenspeed.


"HS348" is the series number for Schwalbe Marathon Plus.

Hi Fran,

I'm trying to remember what I use on the Hope brakes - I think it is just light mineral oil - the bottle I have to hand is actually Singer sewing machine oil. This job is most easily done by a bike shop tho - I don't like adjusting the hydraulic brakes if I don't have to. A local mountain bike shop should be able to work the brakes for you for maybe $20 - they are just the same as mountain bike brakes.

I'd expect the Rohloff & Schlumpf to just need some exercise... As long as they had oil coverage when they went away then I'd hope for them still to be sealed and ready to go. A routine oil change on both would be a good precaution but I'd give them a try first. You might have more problems with the drive chain though, depending on the conditions around where the bike has been stored - sometimes they rust solid if they weren't well protected before being put away.

Good luck!

Rob

Hi Fran,

You are going to be wanting 47-406 Marathon Plus (just a little short of 2in wide). Probably as well to remember to add new tubes too if the existing tyres have rotted.

I have the smaller 35-406 and they are fine but a bit harsh.


HS348 is the tyre/tread name on the other tyres - just an alternative to saying 'Marathon Plus' or whatever on them.

Cheers,

Rob

Hi Rob,

If you were to put mineral oil in a car brake system there would be
no assurance that the components and seals would have the expected
performance or life expectancy.

A designer of a modern braking system would most likely (to avoid liability
issues) select materials to go with the glycol ether and polydimethylsiloxane
that are typically used.  These should be OK if mixed together.  If you are
still in the business of selling and servicing trikes, you might want to
consider using approved brake fluids just to CYA.

Mineral oil was common in decades past; it is no longer considered a
quality brake fluid.  There is also an additive package blended with DOT X
fluids that extend their performance and life.

Food grade mineral oil will have no additives to prolong life, and all
mineral oils are fragile in comparison to the common brake fluids when
exposed to air and heat.  They quickly form polymeric sludges when abused.
  FWIW, I am currently working with an apparatus using mineral oil at 400F,
so the specifications are fresh in my mind.

Mike

Yes, but -- as you may have overlooked -- we don't drive no cars here ...

No, not for bicycle use. A "designer" (??? I would prefer an engineer) of 
a "modern" (whatever that means) braking system should use something 
appropriate for the specific task.

This is wrong. Mineral oil (or better "hydraulic fluid") is a very 
appropriate medium for hydraulic bicycle brakes. All hydraulic Magura 
brakes for example are bleeded with mineral oil and will be destroyed by 
car brake fluid.

Hi Mike,

Erm, we weren't talking cars, we were talking turn of the millennium Hope cycle hydraulics that have been sat in a shed for the last half of that.

The same problem exists with some cycle hydraulic brakes - Hayes are the tricksy ones I've owned using hazardous fluids where as all other brands I've owned have had more 'user friendly' blood.

Either way, the advice holds - first line of attack is to let the local specialists do the job - they'll get the brakes cleaned and serviced more quickly than Fran or I will be able to do at home, with specialist parts such as replacement seals and the fluids & service kit with correct fittings, and all probably for little more than the cost of an eat-in snack as they do the work. Having chatted with Fran in the past I don't think brake servicing would be a job she'd actively want to take on herself. I do the same with the hydraulic stuff myself - every trike seems to have a different brand/model of brake and the local guy has the service kit to hand and the livelihood to maintain.

Rob

My commentary is general regarding disc brakes.  Some of us including Fran
ride long tours where a basic understanding of some details can come in
handy in the hinterlands. Many of us do not have handy
trike savvy mechanics to rely on or the funds to pay them. Hopefully,
knowing that brake fluids can be be intermixed and that they all will work
safely together will save someone extra trouble when the local auto parts
store only has automotive brake fluid.  I can imagine knowing that olive
oil might work in a pinch being useful information.  (Actually a number
of vegetable oils have higher boiling points than mineral oil, thought they
may break down quickly, they would probably get you down off
a mountain safely and without damage to the parts.)

Rather than quash this thread, I would really like to know more about
Magura components being incompatible with normal brake fluid. Obviously, I
would never have assumed such a thing.  Sounds like crazy talk to me.

Subject: [trikes] Hope Brakes
Message-ID: <13f6.1293c704.3c41d819@aol.com>

Hope produces a specific fluid for their brakes.  It is not the  classic 
corrosive brake fluid used in cars.  I think it is mineral-oil  based, but I 
would have the local bike shop fill, bleed and service the  brakes.  I I 
liked the Hopes I had on my first tandem much more than the  Maguras that GS 
went to.  We recently had another trike built up locally,  and the shop used 
the cable actuated Avid 7s. I specified these to avoid  problems  while on 
long trips in the "boonies".. The feel is not quite as  good as the 
hydraulics,but now I don'tworry about leaks or nicked hoses.

It was Sachs cycle hydraulics that I first used, which later became part of SRAM. They recommended using light mineral oil.

Later using Maguras, including 'Big' and the same advice was given. They also always seemed to recommend fitting new 'olives' each time a connection was remade - maybe a clue to preventing seal deterioration? Or just routine replacement or a part that takes damage.

I wouldn't have said this was an incompatibility with 'normal' brake fluid as an imported 'Hayes' disc brake on the rear of my tandem was the first cycle hydraulic brake I encountered that followed the automotive DOT route rather than skin-safe mineral oil.

The Hope discs that Fran has were common on trikes of the era - the ones with the brake handle with a screw-in adjustment cylinder on each handle. They seemed to have a disadvantage that they suffered from locking up due to overheating when left in somewhere hot. The adjustment range of the cylinder was insufficient to adjust the range back to usability necessitating dumping oil as Fran mentioned. When temperatures drop, or if too much fluid is dumped, this can leave the brakes with the levers moving to no effect. 

Hope do a nice little bleed kit that looks like it might be the part for in-the-field bleeding and that takes pressure from a car inner tube but I've not worked out if it is compatible with the necessary generation of Hope hardware yet.

You really like the BB7s Keith?

I've found the power & modulation to be great but I seem to have to adjust them for one thing or another most every 2nd week. I've been trying to work out whether adjustment is drifting (which seems unlikely given how stiff the adjustment knobs are), whether the pads take on moisture from the air (so vary in width as the weather changes) or something else is moving (which I've not spotted yet)...

I've gone for the new 90mm Sturmey Archer drums on my next velo.

I like BB7's on my trike. Only have to adjust them once a season.

The SA 70mm drums work great on the WAW velo. I suspect its because there
are separate Avid Speed Dial levers for each drum.

The same drums were bad on the Go One velo with the puny ganged levers
common on the u-joint tiller steered velos.

Hope brakes have always used automotive brake fluid. Same goes for  
Hayes, Avid, and Formula. Only Magura and Shimano use mineral oil.

Just to confuse the issue further not all hydraulic brakes use "oil"
The Bitex brakes on my trike use what they label "Climate Control Fluid".
It looks to me like radiator fluid, ethylene glycol. I'd like to know 
what it really is.
It seems each brake is different and we need to find what it uses.
I agree that on this occasion Fran should give the expert the job and 
watch and ask questions if possible.
She will then be in a better position to know what to do in the future.

I wanted to buy more chain to lengthen my chain on the GTE but is says SRAM pc-40 and seems that is not made anymore. I have been told it may be a single speed chain and could use any single speed chain to lengthen it and I have been told it is probably an 8 sp chain. Sooooooooo. I still don't know what chain to buy to add to it so some longer legs can pedal the trike. It has a Rohloff hub and Schlumph Mountain drive if that helps any. Is there a chain I can just add to it or do I have to buy all new chain. ???

Magura doesn't say that other brake fluids will be a problem, only that
they are fans of mineral oil.

I have had DOT 5.0 in my early GTO with Hopes for nearly 10 years now.
 FWIW, the same fluid.  DOT 5.0 is the silicon oil that was developed for
antique cars and intended to be non-corrosive (won't damage pretty paint)
and non-reactive/long lasting - at the expense of expanding more and giving
a somewhat less solid feel.  I am not sure, but I think epoxy powder coast
may be pretty immune to DOT 3, 4, 5.1 fluids,  Probably polyurethane paints
don't care - I never see any damage to my autos when I am sloppy.  It will
tear up a nice lacquer paint job though.

I always bleed out and replace all the DOT 3 fluid in used cars I buy (to
remove any accumulate moisture that does cause steel parts to deteriorate,
fouls the fluid, and ruins the wheel cylinders), but I don't know anyone
else that does so.  Nothing unusual about buying a 10 to 20 year old car
with original DOT 3 in it. Water fouled fluid doesn't do much to aluminum
and stainless steel.

Not to be argumentative though it must seem so at this point, the Magura
verbage sounds like marketing hype.   I still wonder what materials they
actually use for their elastomeric parts and about their compatibility.

Be advised also that residents of countries in which REAL Citroens are sold 
can use LHM - Citroen hydraulic fluid - which costs less for a litre than 
Magura charges for a thimble-full.

Magura warns against using DOT brake fluid in their service manuals. For example see this:
http://www.magura.com/uploads/media/downloads/Magura_Scheibenbremsen_EN_2011-06-17_Web.pdf

Here is the relevant quote from it:

"Only use MAGURA ROYAL BLOOD to fill or top up MAGURA disc brakes ? hence no oils from other makers, let alone DOT brake fluid. These can damage the seals and lead to the brakes failing. Risk of accidents! Brakes that have once been filled incorrectly, i.e. with DOT brake fluid, can- not be serviced any longer. They must be replaced completely. Risk of accidents!"

Thanks, Zach!

Well then, that is definitive.  IMO they could have designed it for the
flexible use of many brake fluids, but did not.  Not an attractive feature
to me.  I wonder what their reasoning was.

I recently bought a 55 US gallon drum of high quality mineral oil for
$1500. http://www.paratherm.com/Paratherm-OR/ORbulletin.asp#Oxidation I use
it as a heat transfer fluid (very abusive). Anyone need some (just
kidding)?  That would be $2.55 for a 12 oz jar at cost.

Here is mineral oil for less, for breaking in air craft engines $1050 /
barrel:
http://www.skygeek.com/60006-drum.html?utm_source=googlebase&utm_medium=shoppingengine&utm_content=60006-drum&utm_campaign=froogle
and far less for use as a hydraulic fluid - $650 a barrel:
http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200408668_200408668?cm_sp=Upsells-_-Top%20Sellers-_-Product%20Page


I see that DOT 3 may cost more, $1828 / 55gallon drum.
http://www.fastenal.com/web/products/detail.ex?sku=5100434&ucst=t
but no, here it is for less:
http://www.drillspot.com/products/506830/gunk_m4449_dot_3_brake_fluid?s=1
Fastenal is clearly not the low cost provider.

Maybe Magura uses mineral oil to save money?  With it they can use rubber
seals, instead of Viton and silicon rubber seals which cost more, and
provide better durability.

Magura is a lower cost brake system?  Just curious.  If not, then they may
have higher margins.  No reason to be offended by that if they work well.

DOT 5 is OK with natural rubber parts:
http://www.clearcoproducts.com/pdf/specialty/NP-dot-5-brake-fluid.pdf
This would be the high cost leader I think.

Only DOT 3 and mineral oil are readily available in 55 gallon quantities.
 DOT > 3 is much less common.

This is the sort of first cut investigation a product design engineer will
do regarding every part in a machine.  For trikes you would need to extend
the investigation to encompass international suppilers, shipping, and
currency issues.

Perhaps because Sachs and Magura were the orginators of hydraulic systems on pedal cycles. The original Sachs parts I owned in the late 90s (and which were established products at the time) looked more motorcycle than pedal cycle at the time. Service advice at the time was to treat them as per Citroen brake systems - also mineral oil as mentioned by Mr Larrington.

Systems using DOT products didn't appear here until much later, initially at US imports and treated with mistrust due to use of aggressive chemicals - Hayes was the first I encountered - and they came with warnings of skin & paintwork damage where as the incumbent parts did not.

Also Magura was using mineral oil in their rim brakes dating back to  
the 1980's so they already had experience with seals for it before  
they started making disc brakes in the 1990's. Someone told me Magura  
and Shimano use mineral oil due to strict laws about toxics in  
consumer products in Germany and Japan but I don't have any  
verification of that.

Keith,

Over the years I have had numerous problems with brake and gear cables
fraying and then failing, but no trouble at all with hydraulics.
I think your concern of nicking the cables is unfounded - they are very
robust.
I gather some are tired of my making comparisons to automobiles, but cables
get some application as the very intermittent use in emergency brake
actuation, but all others use hydraulic brakes.  Properly designed
hydraulic brakes are neither finicky nor unreliable. They are also more
powerful in case one is into loaded touring.

Mike

Well. not sure if I should say this, but that has not been my 
experience - my first recumbent (in 1995) was a Peer Gynt which has 
Magura hydraulic rim brakes.

This is a long wheel base under-seat steering (2 wheel) recumbent - 
when you fall on it (as I did a few times, mainly after I put on SPD 
pedals) the first bit you land on is the nut which holds the hydraulic 
hose in the brake lever on the handlebar on the side you fall on - this 
does not appear to do anything, but the next time the brakes is 
applied, the fluid squirts out -  so I had to top up the fluid - as far 
as I can remember, once for the front brake and  3 times for the back 
brake - and I used 'DOT 4" fluid (I still have the bottle - which says 
'fluid will damage paint work") as the first time it happened I was 
with my brother who trained as a car mechanic so he went to the nearest 
garage and bought the bottle of fluid (neither of us knew that mineral 
oil is what is supposed to be used in Magura hydraulics).

The brakes must have done at least  14,000 miles after the various 
refillings over 7 years or so and continued to work - now the front 
brake is probably mainly filled with the original mineral oil, but the 
back brake lost quite a lot of fluid each time I fell, so must be 
almost all DOT 4 fluid.

Maybe I have just been lucky - I still have the Peer Gynt but have not 
ridden it since 2003 as I now mainly ride trikes, but if I ever use it 
again I will have doubts about the brakes.

I have little fear of cable or hose failure, but I have had the nasty experience of finding cables frozen and running off the road to avoid an accident, in colder weather.

Keith,

Over the years I have had numerous problems with brake and gear cables
fraying and then failing, but no trouble at all with hydraulics.
I think your concern of nicking the cables is unfounded - they are very
robust.
I gather some are tired of my making comparisons to automobiles, but cables
get some application as the very intermittent use in emergency brake
actuation, but all others use hydraulic brakes.? Properly designed
hydraulic brakes are neither finicky nor unreliable. They are also more
powerful in case one is into loaded touring.

The world's first mechanical road vehicle, Le Oblissante, had to  
operate on roads that were laid out for horse carts with their  
extreme steering angles.  With hard tires and a dismal power to  
weight ratio, this required very accurate geometry, which was  
provided by the use of irregular chainwheels.

I hope that this list will get lively again.  I thought everyone had  
moved to Facebonk, where never is heard an off-topic word, and the  
eyes are all mired all day.

Do not use both - last year I went cycle camping in Holland on my 
Ti-Rush - I had experimented before I first used my Ti-Rush for camping 
and had found it worked best with my Ortlieb front roller panniers on 
the 'mid-ship' rack and the rest of luggage in my trailer - the problem 
is that this meant the trailer was only half full - now I seem to be 
able to fill all available luggage space up, so as the trip went on (I 
was away for five weeks) the amount of luggage grew - this was not much 
of a problem in Holland (it is quite flat) but when I got home the road 
out of the ferry terminal in North Shields (near Newcastle upon Tyne in 
NE England) is a gentle up-hill but with all my luggage it was really 
difficult - I weighed my luggage when I got home and it was just under 
40 kilos (about 85 pounds) .

Mind, some of the Dutch cyclists I met while I was camping were 
carrying MUCH more than I was.

Hi Barry, I misspelled L' Obeissante, and my reference book does not  
seem to have made it to the 'net yet.  Aircraft steering yokes are  
often chain-drive to improve on cable drives, which are sloppier and  
weaker.  Care must be taken to synchronize the chordal speed  
variations by using identical sprockets and an even number of chain  
links for a smooth action with minimal slop on reversing.  For non- 
linear action such as ackerman variations, a tensioner may be  
needed.  There are lots of examples of non-circular gears, and some  
of those can be adapted for chains.

These days of CAD and CNC, you can easily design your own sprockets and get
them laser cut.

I've learned moderation and restraint the hard way. I use Arkel RT40's mid-ship on my Gold Rush while pulling a BOB trailer, and on my Trice Explorer, I use Arkel GT-54's and a Burley Nomad trailer. Either way, I try to keep gear down to a combined weight of about 20-25 kilos.  Probably doesn't matter - I'm only good for 30-40 miles per day, unless it's all down hill.

 A Short Story for Engineers

A toothpaste factory had a problem: they sometimes shipped empty boxes,
without the tube inside. This was due to the way the production line was
set up, and people with experience in designing production lines will tell
you how difficult it is to have everything happen with timings so precise
that every single unit coming out of it is perfect 100% of the time.

Small variations in the environment (which can't be controlled in a
cost-effective fashion) mean you must have quality assurance checks smartly distributed
across the line so that customers all the way down to the supermarket
don't get pissed off and buy another product instead.

Understanding how important that was, the CEO of the toothpaste factory
got the top people in the company together and they decided to start a new
project, in which they would hire an external engineering company to
solve their empty boxes problem, as their engineering department was already
too stretched to take on any extra effort.

The project followed the usual process: budget and project sponsor
allocated, RFP, third-parties selected, and six months (and $8 million)
later they had a fantastic solution - on time, on budget, high quality
and everyone in the project had a great time. They solved the problem by
using
high-tech precision scales that would sound a bell and flash lights
whenever a toothpaste box would weigh less than it should. The line would stop,
and someone had to walk over and yank the defective box out of it, pressing
another button when done to re-start the line.

A while later, the CEO decides to have a look at the ROI of the project:
amazing results! No empty boxes ever shipped out of the factory after
the scales were put in place. Very few customer complaints, and they were
gaining market share. "That's some money well spent!" - he says, before
looking closely at the other statistics in the report.

It turns out, the number of defects picked up by the scales was 0 after
three weeks of production use. It should've been picking up at least a
dozen a day, so maybe there was something wrong with the report. He
filed a bug against it, and after some investigation, the engineers come back
saying the report was actually correct. The scales really weren't picking up
any defects, because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt
were good.

Puzzled, the CEO travels down to the factory, and walks up to the part of
the line where the precision scales were installed.

A few feet before the scale, there was a $20 desk fan, blowing the empty
boxes out of the belt and into a bin.

"Oh, that," says one of the workers - "one of the guys put it there 'cause
he was tired of walking over... "every time the bell rang".
