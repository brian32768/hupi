<PRE>HI all,


 I finally have my ELF and some time to mess with it.  I thought y'all
might like to hear a little about it.  I can't be to revealing because I
signed an NDA and got a deal to do beta testing (log comments essentially).

I said some things that were probably based on old information from a
website that needed cleaning up, and from comments by people who probably
should have been more circumspect or silent.

here's  what I said at first:

&quot;I think I can really make good use of one.  My commute is 23.5 miles each
way.  More than I can do even if I was fast - it just takes too much time.

This thing will go a full 30 miles without pedaling, I am not sure if that
is at full, electric only, speed.  But, it should be fine with a legs and
battery power.   It has a solar panel, and can be charged from wall current
in two hours.  So I can easily get to work and back.  It will go a lot
faster than 20mph with leg power.  I might maintain 25mph or more for the
trip, double what my legs alone can do on a good day with a lighter trike.
 It will exceed 40mph if you can spin well.  I don't know if it is geared
for higher.&quot;

I still think I will be able to make the commute, but I will have to regain
some fitness.  Yesterday I went shopping and to a brewery for a beer.  The
first leg I averaged 21.7mph, hit 34.4mph on one hill, then I moseyed
around for a little while socializing, bought a gallon of juice, and 4 lb
of popcorn, and headed home.  Final average speed was 19mph.  14 miles
total.  Seemed like I worked pretty hard.  The trike weighs 120lb and I am
currently just under 260. I had an extra battery I did not use (13.4lb),
and jug of water.  I have made some other shorter ride, one at night.

The comment about 30 miles without pedaling, is not something I can get.
 Maybe a small person in flat country, a best case scenario.  I see claims
like that are completely absent t from  the website now.  I can't see
anything they are saying that I would disagree with now.  I think it is all
the claim it is.  But less than I was claiming.  I heard I would recharge
in 2 hours, but the charger they gave me took twice that.  I am not sure of
the state of charge after my ride.  I believe it is a 10Ah battery LiFePO4.

It is stoutly made and not light. So far I think it seems like a very good
first attempt.  It rides quite nicely and felt very confident at 30+mph.
Some times it cuts off hard (going down as fast as possible), one time I
was cruising at 25mph and still getting some help, I think because the
acceleration was low?  It won't give much help unless I gear it differently
or hack something.  I have had to revise my hopes for a 30mph commute down
a lot., BUt maybe I can average 22 fairly soon.


Earlier Bob Stuart made some comments back channel and I thought you all
might be interested in them and how I find the ELF in that regard.

BS:
Why do you think it will go faster with leg power?  The booster cuts out,
leaving you on your own over 20 MPH, and probably unable to maintain 21.
 You'd need a major downhill to see 40.

MR:Right on the money.  But I think I can keep it up above 21.

BS:
I see seven videos to choose from, and no contrary claims for speed.  If it
is fast, they'd brag, not hint.  These things are usually very hackable.
 The 20 MPH limit is sometimes imposed by a jumper wire that can be moved
according to market.  As long as you are visibly pedaling, the police
usually have something else to worry about.

MR: I think it can be done with  a PC.  (Kelly Controls)

My guess would be that without a booster, you would not be able to maintain
the speed you get from a plain bicycle.  Given how easy streamlining is,
I'd expect to get at least a third more speed from any rainproof enclosure,
so to me, adding power is like throwing hardware at a software problem.
 Legally, it is the only way to cruise over 20.  However, the first thing
I'd want to change is the motor control.  A separate switch makes a pedelec
feel like a woefully underpowered regular vehicle.  A pedal-force
multiplier, OTOH, can use the same power that makes you a frustrated
motorist and make you feel like a superman on pedals.  At these power
levels, that gets more important, as your own contribution otherwise feels
insignificant, and you don't even get your exercise motivation.

MR:I am doing OK with the thumb accelerator, but the idea of a pedal switch
is interesting.  I would need an override for it.

You don't want to feel as if you are riding an exercycle on display in an
awkward little cart, disrupting traffic.  All the green points available to
man don't make that look cool.

MR: Well, it is an exercycle to me...but I am not cool.  This isn't an
awkward cart though, it is a pretty good trike.  I have a good route, low
density, 45mph limit.

BS: At these price levels, you also want to check on durability and
serviceability,

MR: So far I am pretty happy with it.  It is well built.  Maybe some trim
component issues.

BS: and ask yourself if you will be able to put up with the drum-like road
noise amplification over the long haul.  Try to get a decibel reading, and
ponder the enormous health and productivity gains realized by efforts to
quiet down offices.  Would you be safe with noise-canceling headphones on?

MR: It isn't noisy enough that I can remember except on rough pavement.  IT
is doorless and that seems like a goo compromise.  The breeze is OK for
moderate temps that I have seen, side winds aren't an issue so far, and it
doesn't sound like being in a barrel or anything.

BS:
Your numbers don't add up.  The power required at 30 mph is double to
triple what you need at 20.

MS: I am in total agreement, now.  Maybe with some hot rodding and shorter
cranks... The ride is half down hill, half uphill, so maybe I can make up
some time on the downsides.

Bob also brought up lighting controls, ELF has an OK handle bar switch for
headlamps, turns,LEDs, and a horn relay so these switches see little power.
 May be OK wait and see.  Brake lights from a disc brake mounted switch
(have not looked close at that)  I think I want a dash to reduce reflection
from below.  Some black fabric can do that. And, I just like more forward
light so will do more there.

That's all for now.  I just wanted to correct some things I said that were
incorrect or dated.

Thanks for all past and future comments.

Mike
