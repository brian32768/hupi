Hi Folks,

It's time to shake off the Winter doldrums and celebrate Human Power 
(and the Spring!!!)

The '09 New England HPV Rally will be held on Saturday, May 9, 2009 in 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire in conjunction with the Portsmouth 
Sustainability Fair.  Details can be found on the events page at 
www.wildfirehpv.com

If previous events are any guide, we should have a good range of 
different human powered vehicles, including commercially built and 
homebuilt velomobiles, human/electric hybrids (past events included a 
solar powered upright built mostly from junk!) and a wide range of 
different recumbents.


Hope to see you there!

Best,
-Ethan
