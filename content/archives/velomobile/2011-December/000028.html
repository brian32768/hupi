<PRE>Frederik Van De Walle 
a person with an extensive VM background wrote an excellent view on VM rollover issues. 


&gt;<i>Preventing roll-over accidents completely is impossible, making the vehicle wider will move the treshold - but when it happens it will hurt just as much or even more given that it will happen at higher speeds.
</I>
&gt;<i>But we also need to understand that the end user also has a responsibility. To operate any vehicle safely, the end user needs to understand that any vehicle has 
</I>limitations, and that it is your responsibility to operate it within 

&gt;<i>So we need to be sure that people approach a velomobile with respect, and not as a fail safe toy.
</I>

.........The bigger danger here in the USA I feel is the continual use of 3,000 pound cars to run local errands. I live in a town of 20,000 people and over 25 years I am the only person using a HPV. If only 1 % were to use an HPV that would begin to thrill me. 

My major interest is in low speed practical vehicles that would be used for 2 to  5 mile local alternate transportation. Aerodynamics and speed would not be at the top of the list but reduced effort - meaning light weight, small size for parking, and easy access to decent cargo space and weather protection are some of the design drivers. 

We have a lot of work to do to get to this level.
