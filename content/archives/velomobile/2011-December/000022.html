.....If your talking about Collaborative Velomobile its only a few weeks old. We are still interviewing potential members. When we get more organized things will happen.

....yes there are many advantages to a bike. its lighter, smaller, lower costs, easy to park and store - BUT can you ride it all year long or is it seasonably limited? And does it have rain protection, and crash protection ?.
If you fall off a bike you hit the ground with your body.  A VM is more  visible to car drivers specially at night and is treated more like a vehicle. 

I have been running various recumbents and streamliners for 25 years and now 7 years in a VM. To me a VM is a completely different vehicle - no comparison.  

&gt;<i>So I vote for much bigger cargo space in velo. 
</I>.....then you need a Delta. 

You are comparing bikes with one of the smallest VMs - Alleweder. 
As you have pointed out Lightfoot is making more practical vehicles which is what I am in favor of. 


&gt;<i>Everything complex is already done, technologies are ready made, we 
</I>should just pick up these proved technologies together and mix it in new 
fresh shape.

...........This VM development is still in its youngest stages (10 years). Technology is not the problem - its changing the consciousness of people into accepting Human Powered Vehicles as alternate transportation. 
With the environment getting hammered we have a chance of seeing a change.
