<PRE>Frederik Van De Walle lays out his thoughts on integrating velomobiles
into the cycling infrastructure in his Senior Thesis, which I've
put here: <A HREF="http://www.lobosolo.com/fvdw/Velomobile4SusTrans.pdf">http://www.lobosolo.com/fvdw/Velomobile4SusTrans.pdf</A>

I see additional problems in the USA, in the safety realm. Tricycles
are inherently safe only in a much smaller envelope than North
Americans are used to. Our famous last words here are &quot;Hey guys, watch
this ...&quot; and we all know this is why we don't let yahoos into our
velomobiles. I bet it wouldn't be a month before someone rolled one,
just off the dealer's lot, on a test ride. Those of us who have bought
them so far have been through a learning progression, the value of
which is incredible. Mine was P-38, Trice, Windcheetah, Versatile.

The Bentrider online report about the rollover on the trike just
reinforces what I posted earlier about the inherent danger of losing
that rear contact point on a tadpole layout. For me, on the
Windcheetah, about 40 mph, blew out the sidewall of the rear tire,
which spun the vehicle (always anti-clockwise ... I wonder for you
guys south of the equator, do yours spin clockwise?) and before I
could cogitate, once the vehicle turns 90 degrees to its inertial
vector, it &gt;will&lt; roll. Reliably.
