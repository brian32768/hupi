<PRE>I am car free in central California. I do not have to deal with snow but do have to deal with rain which is sometime freezing and sometimes heavy i.e. up to an half an inch an hour, yet I am able to ride in the rain and cold and stay relatively dry and warm on my ATP Vision R42 with a Zipper fairing and a home made &quot;rain coat&quot; that attaches to the fairing and wraps around me to protect me from wet weather or extreme *(20 degrees Fahrenheit is about as cold as it ever gets here) cold. Someone once said of the bike that it was a convertible i.e. a rag top . 

The site , hupi.org, does not seem to have the ability to upload pictures and I never open any email attachments unless I have to so I would not expect anyone else to either but I do belong to some yahoo groups that do. Is this something that might interest you or others in the group? If so do any of you in the group belong to any of the following yahoo groups : <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vision-bent-owners/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vision-bent-owners/</A> , <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RECUMBENT_RIDERS_OF_SACRAMENTO/&#160;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RECUMBENT_RIDERS_OF_SACRAMENTO/&#160;</A> ,&#160; or&#160; <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CarFree/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CarFree/</A> 

I have images of my bike in those groups and if anyone reading this belongs to any of those, i.e. most likely carfree, it would be fairly easy to pick out my bike from the many albums.
If there is interest in my version of an automobile substitute I would be glad to attach images to future e-mails for you to risk opening. 

The car free yahoo group album needs a few more recent images but if you belong 

<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CarFree/photos/album/1988420494/pic/159614997/view?picmode=&amp;mode=tn&amp;order=ordinal&amp;start=1&amp;count=20&amp;dir=asc">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CarFree/photos/album/1988420494/pic/159614997/view?picmode=&amp;mode=tn&amp;order=ordinal&amp;start=1&amp;count=20&amp;dir=asc</A> 

I write descriptions when I post images because even though an image is worth a thousand words a few words goes a long way to helping describe what I wanted to show in the image and even why sometimes.
