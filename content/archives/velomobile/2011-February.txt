Greetings --

This mailing list "velomobile at bikelist.org" is moving to "velomobile at hupi.org".

The move will probably commence on Monday or Tuesday, depending on how
busy we are. When Alex (at bikelist.org) is ready, he will turn off
the list at bikelist.org so no new messages will be accepted there
(this includes commands such as subscribe/unsubscribe requests). Alex
will then send the list data to me and I will install it and
reactivate the list at hupi.org.

We're using the same software at both servers so in theory this should
be a simple move.

You don't have to do anything -- except start using the new address
after the move.
I will send another message when the list is running at hupi.org.

Sorry, but if you're on more than one 'hpv' list you will be reading
this message more than once!
