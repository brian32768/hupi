I'd like it if there _were_ any companies to do lobbying here - people 
have tried to sell these things, but nobody lasts long in the business. 
They always seemed to be bickering, fragmented and demoralised.

&gt;<i> I understand that California allows motors up to 2 HP and speeds up to
</I>&gt;<i> 30 mph, although you need to have a driver's license to qualify. As a
</I>&gt;<i> practical matter, no governmental bodies seem to be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> enforcing these speeds or power levels, so they only have the effect of
</I>&gt;<i> limiting what manufacturers can sell. Otherwise it is likely nobody
</I>&gt;<i> would notice violations of this law unless lawyers got involved.
</I>
When lawyers got involved, and if there was substantial damage or 
injury, you can bet the rules would change real quick.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks David, I concur with all your points. There's one other that

</I>&gt;<i> Any velo is so much heavier than a bicycle that it needs all the help it

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So lobbying for reasonable power limits and restrictions of these things
</I>&gt;<i> is paramount in places that limit them unreasonably. The present laws in
