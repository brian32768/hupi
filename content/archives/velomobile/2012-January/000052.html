&gt;<i>Catrike Speed to which I added a body. My main objections to it were the harsh ride and lack of good road hazard vision due to the body and reclined position. 
</I>........Adding a shell on a vehicle that wasn't designed for a shell often has some disadvantages such as the seat being too reclined etc. I would like to see a couple of trike manufactures build a trike layout that is compatible for adding a shell (not a big deal). Then homebuilders could experiment with building their own shells - and we all learn in the process. 

&gt;<i> has a small amount of suspension to dampen the jarring effects of bad roads and I plan to add Schwalbe Big Apples
</I>....I have small motion suspension and it does a reasonable job and it only adds about a pound for the two front wheels. I also have been running the fat Primo Comets for years. With their thin sidewalls they give the smoothest ride and great acceleration. Big Apples ride a bit harsher but acceptable.  I run the Comets at 60 psi

&gt;<i>I can't imagine why anyone would want to pedal up some of our hills
</I>....I case you don't know I built a E assist that does a fair job of taking he sting out of the hills and only weighs 4.3 pounds. 

&gt;<i>I see some major design challenges making them light enough to be practical, while relatively easy to manufacture. 
</I>......I feel it doable. My foam shell weighs 7 pounds and I would think it could be manufactured fairly low cost. But the major problem is getting acceptance of foam. That's the big one.
