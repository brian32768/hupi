Hi all,
Just noticed that the good old Kreuzotter site with all its useful 
calculators (e.g. http://www.kreuzotter.de/english/espeed.htm ) has gone 
404. Does anyone know if these things are available elsewhere?

G.

They seem to have gone out of business some time ago.
If you can read German: 
http://www.velomobilforum.de/forum/showthread.php?t=16131

Maybe some of it is available via Google. You could try to google your 
favourite page and read it from the cached pages, but excavating the 
whole site might be a worrysome task.

That paragraph was confusing in the early morning!  They are obsolete, they are gone, they are cached...  
OK! I am glad this list appears in my mailbox; great to comment without becoming a big controversy as
Yahoo! groups has become.  The only Yahoo! site worth anything to me is Flickr>velomobile pool .
