John, go ahead and try to send attachments. The turtle test succeeded and
the messages are now being properly stored on the server.

Brian

If any of you are interested I could  Email a 4 part package consisting of
>
> Project Invitation, Background on Velomobiles, Collaborative Charter, and
> Practical HPVs.  Each essentially one page documents.
>
>
>
> Or I could attach=E9 them to this HPV Velomobile list. .

To make velomobiles into practical vehicles for the masses I believe
that they need to be all-wheel drive, and for that to happen I think
the best way is with an electronic drive train. That means an
efficient, lightweight pedal generator, a 3D sensor system, a virtual
differential and lightweight, efficient hub motors at the corners. The
shape of the bodywork and the structure of the monocoque are well
evolved. The drive train work has been pioneered by Andreas Fuchs (
http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/0015/0015.html ).

Of course, YMMV.

Also anti-lock braking, full suspension with descent travel and  
electronic stability control to prevent this from happening:

When hitting bumps at speed and panic braking or swerving to avoid  
something, it should really be at least as the least stable narrow  
track body on frame SUVs that are sold to the masses.

Glad to see activity in this list and glad to see progress on project of 
OS velo.
I have read all the texts and am a bit sad how general and nothing 
detailed they are.
So let me give my two cents.

I am fresh user of Alleweder A3 velomobile (see 
http://www.lehokolo.com/view.php?cisloclanku=2011102801) and need to say:
- protection - what I like much is weather protection, even in subzero 
temperatures I feel comfortably
- speed - velo really has better coasting and superb downhill, uphill 
nothing great, much worse then any bike I have, but acceptable, I was 
able to climb all my local hils.
- cargo capacity - poor - I am used to brompton bike with their great 
front c-bag (see 
http://www.prahounakole.cz/2010/03/nakladni-kola-iv-ladova-cesta-k-xtracycle/) 
and occasionaly with bike trailer  (see http://www.bikerev.com/) there 
is almost nothing what I am not able to move with this combo. Alleweder 
cannot accept even bag small as my brompton C-bag. It has some cargo 
capacity but oddly shaped, you can load only quite narrow cargo. For 
bulky items and my boys and wife I use xtracycle.

So I vote for much bigger cargo space in velo. My need is, that velo 
should accept both - my brompton bike and my brompton C-bag as cargo. It 
looks strange and radical, but it is what I can easily move with my car 
and if velo should be replacement for my car then it should accept cargo 
like this (btw nothing extra bulky :-) ). If the velo could have 
designed clever way how to add even more cargo, better. My bike for real 
cargo is xtracycle. System of wide loaders and long loaders of xtracycle 
hardly could be overcome. (see 
http://www.xtracycle.com/cargo-bicycles/cargo-bike-accessories/wideloader-load-shelves.html) 
Bike has mounting points for extra platform used for even more cargo.

So my wishes for velo are:
- as low as alleweder
- open head as alleweder
- cargo trunk as big as asphalt tretboot of harald winkler (see Youtube 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX1ko9e0kJ4 or 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMH45oJvAZU)
- or cargo trunk as big as velocar from lightfoot recumbents (see 
http://www.lightfootcycles.com/velomobiles_from_Lightfoot_Cycles.php)
- xtracycle wide and long loaders compatible (see 
http://www.xtracycle.com/cargo-bicycles/cargo-bike-accessories/wideloader-load-shelves.html 
again)
- steel frame made from jackels ala atomic zombie (see 
http://www.atomiczombie.com/main.aspx)
- foam fairing as john tetz does (see 
http://www.recumbents.com/mars/pages/proj/tetz/manual/0intro.html) or 
coroplast  fairing (see 
http://www.lightfootcycles.com/velomobiles_from_Lightfoot_Cycles.php again)
- what I am not sure is if the velo has to be suspended or not, probably 
so, then let it has proven mcpherson setup of alleweder, but my 
experience with folding bikes says that maybe tires like schwalbe big 
apple is enough.

Everything complex is already done, technologies are ready made, we 
should just pick up these proved technologies together and mix it in new 
fresh shape.

I have two home made velomobiles. One is a tadpole trike with a chromoly tube 
space frame with a small amount of front suspension. The other is a delta 
leaning trike with front wheel drive. The leaning aspect improves the cornering 
considerably, but the two rear wheels stick out into the airflow and create a 
fair amount of drag. I have a retractable brass pin so that the lean can be 
locked out when you come up to a stop sign or are starting off. It is also 
helpful when climbing steep hills as you don't have to balance. I have laid it 
on its side a number of times trying to get the tilt lock to work correctly. 
When transitioning from locked to unlocked tilt there is a noticeable change in 
the handling that requires some getting used to. Overall I am not sure the tilt 
is worth the bother, but cornering at speed is more fun than on my tadpole 
trike. I plan to fool around with it a bit more before moving on. Both of the 
bodies are made of coroplast. After 2-3 years it gets a bit ragged but it is 
easy to fabricate. I like the concept of the Tri sled with the rotationally 
molded body. I think that has the possibility of lowering the cost. Most of the 
velomobiles are just way too expensive.

I explored a tilter a couple of years ago and found it had more problems =
than solutions. I simply dont need high speed cornering for a alternate =

17 to 18 mph. That's fast enough.=20

Frederik Van De Walle lays out his thoughts on integrating velomobiles
into the cycling infrastructure in his Senior Thesis, which I've
put here: http://www.lobosolo.com/fvdw/Velomobile4SusTrans.pdf

I see additional problems in the USA, in the safety realm. Tricycles
are inherently safe only in a much smaller envelope than North
Americans are used to. Our famous last words here are "Hey guys, watch
this ..." and we all know this is why we don't let yahoos into our
velomobiles. I bet it wouldn't be a month before someone rolled one,
just off the dealer's lot, on a test ride. Those of us who have bought
them so far have been through a learning progression, the value of
which is incredible. Mine was P-38, Trice, Windcheetah, Versatile.

The Bentrider online report about the rollover on the trike just
reinforces what I posted earlier about the inherent danger of losing
that rear contact point on a tadpole layout. For me, on the
Windcheetah, about 40 mph, blew out the sidewall of the rear tire,
which spun the vehicle (always anti-clockwise ... I wonder for you
guys south of the equator, do yours spin clockwise?) and before I
could cogitate, once the vehicle turns 90 degrees to its inertial
vector, it >will< roll. Reliably.

Hi John,
there is no question about VM advantage in rough weather conditions, 
that is the reason why I have bought my second hand Alleweder A3.
I am just a bit disappointed by its real cargo capacity and feel it as 
no permanent solution.
Importing Lightfoot CycleBug is out of question. Price climbs even 
steeper during importing process. Also I feel, it is a bit too much of 
frontal area.
Buying of new bigger VM is out also by the price reason.

If I can somehow help in your collaborative project (I live in Europe 
Prague) please let me know.
I love your tutorials and hope that current project will produce another 
Open Source plans for cheap practical vehicle in obvious Tetz DIY fashion.
Do you know that harald winkler has been selling plans for his asphalt 
tretboot?

Elrey is concerned with roll-over accidents with trikes and velomobiles, a =
very valid concern. Current velomobile experience does show that velomobile=
s are relatively very safe, but indeed that can change when in the hands of=
 less experienced members of the public. =0A=0A=0ASafety is always a concer=
n for any designer with a conscience. I think about it almost daily. You ca=
n do your best to design the vehicle as safe as possible within the chosen =
general lay-out, one can warn for the possible dangers (personally, or in a=
 manual), one can give driver training and/or restrict access (drivers lice=
nse or 'sign here, stating you understand the risks of using this vehicle a=
nd have understood how to operate it'. ) and lastly, one can hope and pray =
that nothing bad happens because ultimately, you can't control the user.=0A=
=0A=0ARoll-over accidents happen with velomobiles, and more so if they beco=
me more widespread. As such a velomobile would need proper roll-over protec=
tion, a roll-over bar or even a structural roof. Preventing roll-over accid=
ents completely is impossible, making the vehicle wider will move the tresh=
old - but when it happens it will hurt just as much or even more given that=
 it will happen at higher speeds. So as the likelyhood reduces, consequence=
s become bigger. Yet the combined risk is surely lower for a wide vehicle.=
=A0 Unfortunately, making a velomobile as wide that it will be less likely =
to roll than a car, will reduce many of its other wonderful properties and =
indeed compatibility with cycling tracks. I don't believe that a tilting tr=
ike is a solution either, as once you reach the vehicle limits, you too can=
 skid and fall/roll or in worst case, flip over. We have a very real limita=
tion here. Acting upon that, the manufacturer has an responsibility to make
 the vehicle safe as can be done. When talking =0Aopen trikes, there is onl=
y so much one can do. If a velomobile body is =0Astructural, it will be eas=
ier but also more expected that one =0Aincorporates roll-over protection. =
=0A=0A=0ABut we also need to understand that the end user also has a respon=
sibility. To operate any vehicle safely, the end user needs to understand t=
hat any vehicle has =0Alimitations, and that it is your responsibility to o=
perate it within =0Athose limitations. The job of the manufacturer/reseller=
 or just a simple user who lets somebody have a go, is to communicate what =
limitations =0Aexist if a new user is unfamiliar. When people test drive, I=
 have always warned for that your typical velomobile will =0Aroll-over soon=
er and often demonstrated a 2-wheel turn =0A(wheelie ...) to illustrate it.=
=A0=0A=0AComparing/illustrating again. Yes, it is tempting to think that ca=
rs don't roll. That, or we use them within their limitations. It was swedes=
 that made the scandal with the Mercedes A-class that rolled over in their =
moose evasion test caught on film and widely spread. Indeed, it looked bad.=
 But truth is, many cars will roll if only you yank that steering wheel har=
d enough in one and then quickly after the other direction. Yet almost ever=
ybody understands that this is not done. I also like to make the comparison=
 to a sports motorbike that has very severe limitations to what a user can =
do. Anybody with a license (which older generation just got as an extra wit=
h the car licence) can buy then, but not everybody should be using them. Mo=
st people understand that, some don't. Because when observing objectively, =
simply 'using' the throttle can have disastrous consequences on the majorit=
y of motorbikes for sale. Yes, the latest and most expensive iterations hav=
e
 traction control - but a few touring bikes apart, the prime function to go=
 faster, not prevent noobs from user error. A similar thing applies for the=
 brakes. Now ABS is more common, but before squeezing the front brake meant=
 you opted to continue your travel by air, willing or not. I a similar fash=
ion, the same can be said with bicycles when the first V-brakes and disk br=
akes came. =0A=0A=0ASo we need to be sure that people approach a velomobile=
 with respect, and not as a fail safe toy. We all have a responsibility the=
re and it is good to be aware of this. That, and that you need to spell out=
 to new users what is obvious to regular users. =0A=0AConcerning blow-outs.=
 Indeed, the windcheetah is very twitchy without rear grip. Good fun, but w=
ith a blow-out, very hard to control. And indeed, a single rear wheel and a=
 blow-out are not a nice combination. At the same time, one needs to rememb=
er that few vehicles are safe in such a situation. Any vehicle with a rear =
tyre blow-out is prone to oversteering if doing anything more than travelli=
ng in a straight line. Oversteer and rolling over go together. Nowadays car=
s have stabilisation systems like ESP etc. (since nov 1 2011 required by la=
w for new cars to get a european type approval) and some have run-flat tyre=
s that do much to keep a car safe during a blow-out. This is definitely a b=
ig step forward. Perhaps some kind of run-flat system for the rear tyre is =
something to consider for future velomobile tadpoles, too. In the end thoug=
h, one still relies that one doesn't blow out close to it's maximum dynamic=
 capabilities. And as far as statistics go, if
 I recall correctly, the most dangerous dynamic scenario for a single car h=
as always been oversteer for whatever cause and - with speed involved, the =
high risk of ensuing roll-over(s). That is why just about every car for sal=
e has a chassis set-up for understeer. The same applies for velomobiles. Co=
ntrary to what might assume, the tadpole in not necessarily more prone to u=
ndersteer because of the single rear wheel, it really depends on many thing=
s in the design. Apart from blow-outs, delta trikes actually have a greater=
 tendency to oversteer because as the inner wheel lifts, the slip angle inc=
reases more in the rear than the lighter loaded front tyre. =0A=0ASafety is=
 a strange thing. From the above one would assume this velomobile would be =
the safest: http://www.ecofriend.com/entry/the-world-s-slowest-porsche-911-=
is-pedal-powered/. Yet you will easily finds people who shall disagree. And=
 we haven't even started talking about risk compensation effects of any saf=
ety measure. =0A=0ASo perhaps the most important thing is to communicate pr=
operly at all times and to adjust one's behaviour to the perceived safety o=
f the vehicle at hand. It is better to underestimate than to overestimate h=
ow safe a vehicle is. And it's user. All too many have a tendency to overes=

What do you consider a velomobile? =A0In 1999 or so the first description I=

Well, it seems the list is still alive. I've been looking after
Hypertrike.org, an Open Source,  collaborative velomobile project here in
Western Australia for a few years now.

Not much has been happening as I'm caught up in the mining boom here, and
therefore away from home most of the time ... working what is called "fifo"
(Fly-In - Fly  Out) in the remote North West of the state.

After a few false starts, the body shell is now likely to take the form of
a parallel sided (think flattened cylinder) mid section of aluminium panels
with fibre reinforced front and tail streamlined components.

When finished, these components should be relatively easy to ship anywhere
in the world, there to be asily copied by other collaborative velomobile
enthusiasts.

Which reminds me I must update the Hypertrike website with some photos of
the current progress, before I fly out again. What a new year's resolution.
:)

   Following John Tetz=E2=80=99s plea for us to get together and work on =
the future of velomobiles, I=E2=80=99ve enjoyed reading your =
contributions. Here is my two cents worth.
   From an engineering point of view, velomobile design has to start out =
conceptually with a list of specifications that the final vehicle must =
satisfy. Nobody seems to do this on paper, but one can back-figure what =
the specifications are that the final vehicle satisfies or fails to =
satisfy when it is tested. Velomobile design has to deal with almost all =
of the problems that must be solved in the design of a small car. It is =
a long list, but speed, low noise, cushy ride, weather and crash =
protection, stability and handling qualities, the ability to stop =
quickly and safely, power efficiency, ease of ingress and egress, cost, =
convenience, ease of maintenance, cost of parts, etc. are some of the =
requirements. Velos are used for commuting, shopping, long tours, =
recreational day rides, running errands, racing, etc. Some machines are =
designed specifically for racing, with little or no thought given to =
other uses. Some velos are quite capable of a whole range of tasks, =
while others are best for only one or two types of use. An all-around =
velo has a better chance of commercial success than one that is only =
good for a few things. Owning many velos is too expensive. Carrying =
bulky objects is best done with a specialized vehicle or a velo with a =
cargo trailer.
   You can fairly easily put an aero body on an existing unsuspended =
trike, but you are likely to end up with many difficulties, including =
body attachments to the trike, noise of thin shells vibrating, and many =
others. Chief among these may be that when the aerodynamics are great =
and you can go really fast, not having a suspension can be mighty =
uncomfortable. It is likely to result in the rider getting lots of =
reasons to upgrade to a well-designed (and expensive) velomobile. So you =
can =E2=80=9Ccheat=E2=80=9D on any of the design requirements up to a =
point, but the ones that riders want will come back to haunt you if your =
velo doesn=E2=80=99t have them.
   I harken back to the day that the Tempelman shop opened in Dronten in =
the Netherlands. Johan Vrielink, chief of Flevobike, came up, put his =
hand on my shoulder, and said =E2=80=9CBuilding velomobiles is the =
hardest thing I have ever done in my life.=E2=80=9D Over the years, I =
have come to realize the truth of this statement. There have been =
tremendous numbers of dream velos that never come to fruition because of =
this fact. Getting a design =E2=80=9Cfrozen=E2=80=9D and getting it into =
production is quite difficult. The market is ephemeral so raising money =
for a big production run is really hard. All VM manufacturers hope that =
Ford or General Motors or Toyota will never understand the wonderful =
future for the world full of velomobiles, and so far, the companies =
never have.=20
   This means that a velomobile association could combine resources and =
apply the least expensive of auto design techniques, software, and =
testing to improve velomobiles. There is a broad range of technologies =
applicable to velos. You can perhaps imagine a design group equipped =
with all the latest computer design tools and testing capabilities =
switching their focus from engine-powered cars to human-powered cars.
Velomobiles need structural analysis, braking and stability studies, =
suspension improvements, electrical system upgrades, and production =
manufacturing techniques to lower their cost, among other things. We can =
go after the =E2=80=9Clow-hanging=E2=80=9D fruit, as it were. In the =
wings are ideas for tandem velos, special cargo trailers and associated =
velo attachments, power trailers, power assists, and a host of other =
technical issues that need design, development, testing and evaluation, =
production expertise, and marketing.
    A great deal of experience was gained with the velos that were used =
on ROAM . Stability with regard to rumble strips, braking for descending =
mountain passes, gearing that allows high speeds downhill but very low =
speeds up steep hills, shifting systems that enable going smoothly from =
your highest gear downhill to your lowest gear going up the next steep =
hill, drive trains that do not drop chains, even when backing, etc. Many =
of us spent much time replacing brake drum plates, brake disks, tires =
and tubes, and other parts.  We had four velos roll over, mostly on =
rumble strips. Nobody was badly hurt, but one was damaged so much that =
the rider retired and went home. Another velo was put out of commission =
by a deep pothole in the Chicago area, and one was knocked over by an =
SUV in D.C.  I could have a whole discussion (along with Frederick) =
regarding incidents and our experiences with the =E2=80=9Cground =
loop=E2=80=9D instability of tadpole trikes. Following advice on tires =
and rims by Ian Sims, David Gordon Wilson, and Ymte Sybrandy we at VMUSA =
opted to use Marathon Plus tires on the rear of our tadpole trikes. They =
are thick and heavy and hard to mount, which is just what is needed so =
they don=E2=80=99t blow out and tend to stay on the rims even when =
deflated. Nobody will use them for racing or very fast recreational =
rides, but they are great for safety.
I look forward to working with others that can contribute to solving =
some of these problems. I see my most immediate contributions in the =
areas of dynamic simulation, vehicle systems testing and analysis, work =
towards improved suspension and braking, and drive train improvements. =
The work of Bill Patterson and others should be of great help in these =
efforts.
   I guess we will have to rely on our own ideas and resources for =
low-budget design and development paths. The realization of all the =
things we want for velos would cost millions, and it is not clear that =
such funds will ever be available. The cost spectrum ranges from about =
$4000 to $25,000 for velos now extant. Prices for materials and hardware =
are steadily increasing. The goal of inexpensive velos that have the =
advanced features we want is going to be really , really difficult. Low =
cost velos presuppose major investments in design, development, testing, =
manufacturing, and marketing. Who will find the money is a big question. =
And only those project managers that are real velo riders and racers =
with be able to =E2=80=9Cthread the needle=E2=80=9D through all the =
development and commercial pitfalls to get a successful and long-term =
valued product.

David,

Don't forget that the automotive types have had their 'go' and shown =
they're not necessarily able to do the deed or even understand what is =
needed...

A few years ago the Blue Yonder team spent an alleged GBP250,000 =
(US$375,000) putting together a 'Speed bike' to compete at Battle =
Mountain. They did this based on automotive principles, theoretical =
modelling and fancy materials rather than speaking to the HPV community =
- the result being a huge bike that looked to have maybe 3x the wet area =
of other Battle Mountain machines and achieved a top speed of maybe =
three-quarters that of the competition despite having an 'Olympian' =
engine.

No point really, other than don't wait for the automotive crowd to get =
the job done!

There was a message?  :)


John (Tetz) & all, I am very interested in working farther on the project. 

I am working with David on his velos now, and some of the points he's brought up with me here about the collaboration have been important ones. As soon as the two (or more) of you get together and start discussing some of the focus and intellectual property aspects (as we all should have some aspects in that area to protect), then I will feel free to begin some input as I need to know the bounds under which the project will be working.

    Congratulations on the new group.
After hosting four years of the Niagara Velomobile  Happening I have a few
 observations to  share.
    We have had a wide range of velomobiles show up and endless technical
discussion
going into the late night hours.
   We have had enjoyable rides through town and displayed our velomobiles.
What I observe from this wide range of designs  is that they all work and
provide the
riders with satisfactory transportation.
   Every possible need or solution has been addressed by someone. There have
been clever solutions to perceived problems that may not exist.
   I take enjoyment from building velomobiles and using them but actually
selling them is a chore for which I am not qualified.
    Production since 1990, twenty one years ,has been one to two units per year.


     Perhaps a marketing movement will emerge in this group to move us foreward.



                                               Reg Rodaro

David Eggleston=20

Thank you for giving your experienced and wide ranging overview on =
various VM issues. Very valuable information.=20
I agree we have a lot yet to learn but we have accomplished a lot in =
these last 10 years of VM development.=20

>An all-around velo has a better chance of commercial success than one =
that is only good for a few things.
......Too much of a range is asking a lot of a design, given the power =
source is so weak. Seems to me that honing a design for a specific area =
of need is more apt to be accomplished. Cars range from small to large =
with few to many features to accomplish various needs.=20

 What I have set my sights on is a practical suburban human powered =
alternate transportation vehicle to be  used by average folks to do =
their shopping and running errands in the 2 to 5 mile radius. Average =
speed 14 mph. These design limits give the opportunity to come up with a =
viable vehicle.=20

> You can fairly easily put an aero body on an existing unsuspended =
trike, but you are likely to end up with many difficulties, including =
body attachments to the trike, noise of thin shells vibrating, and many =
others.=20
........How true this is. But I look at the fact that the bare trike =
business is booming. Although adding a shell of some kind may not be =
ideal it does change a trike into a vehicle, a vehicle that is first of =
all not seasonably limited, has weather protection, some crash =
protection, more visible to cars  etc. This will change the =
consciousness of the trike rider into using the vehicle more as local =
alternate transportation rather than just recreation.=20

Second, by being seen by the public these vehicles will affect their =
awareness. I see and hear a change in the publics response to my VM over =
a 7 year period. They more often comment now - it doesn't use gas, its =
good for the environment, and its good for the health of the rider, etc. =
 =20
 I am hearing more and more happy - I like what you are doing horn honks =
 -  from drivers.=20
The publics environmental awareness is changing. We need a viable =
practical vehicle.=20
It doesn't need all the wish list of advanced features.=20

I designed my present VM 8 years ago coming from a long background with =
streamliners and the thrill of speed.
What's important to me now is weather protection (head in), light =
weight, quiet, ease of access to decent cargo space, some amount of =
suspension, small physical size for parking reasons. Aerodynamics is =
there but further down the list.=20
 This is accomplishable given what we know. =20
In another 10 years more viable vehicles will be developed. =20

>  I guess we will have to rely on our own ideas and resources for =
low-budget design and development paths.=20
.....Yes, but some method of sharing ideas is very important. Look at =
the advancements made after the birth of the IHPVA in 1975   - which =
eventually lead to present day Velomobiles.=20

In some ways its less a technology issue than a change in consciousness =
as to why and how we use these vehicles. Requiring the wish list of =
advanced features hints of 19th and 20th century thinking where the =
Earths energy and resources were thought to be limitless. Efficiency - =
doing more with less - is the 21st century password. HPVs are up with =
the efficiency of railroad trains and super tankers. =20

Notice for one how I have skirted the issue of funding.=20

I agree with most of what John says. I have gotten a lot of favorable responses 
from motorists as I cruise about in my homemade velomobile. And a lot of 
questions from interested persons. The biggest hurdle for many folks and the 
reason I made my own is cost. When I tell people what a commercial velomobile 
would cost the typical response is, "I could buy a car for that". The cost has 
to come down for these to become practical transportation. For several years I 
rode a Catrike Speed to which I added a body. My main objections to it were the 
harsh ride and lack of good road hazard vision due to the body and reclined 
position. There has been a resurgence of single speed bikes around here and I 
suspect that is mostly due to the simplicity of the design. It is very hilly 
here and I can't imagine why anyone would want to pedal up some of our hills, 
but they are doing it. So in short I think the KISS principle applies here. Keep 
it simple stupid. My current homemade velomobile has a small amount of 
suspension to dampen the jarring effects of bad roads and I plan to add Schwalbe 
Big Apples when my current tires wear out to see how that affects the ride and 
handling. I think the big challenge will be coming up with a design that can be 
economically produced on a big scale. Sort of a Model T version of the 
velomobile. Making them one at a time is never going to be cost effective.  I 
see some major design challenges making them light enough to be practical, while 
relatively easy to manufacture. To me the Rotovelo is step in the right 
direction.

Thank you for giving your experienced and wide ranging overview on various VM 
issues. Very valuable information. 

I agree we have a lot yet to learn but we have accomplished a lot in these last 
10 years of VM development. 


>An all-around velo has a better chance of commercial success than one that is 
>only good for a few things.
......Too much of a range is asking a lot of a design, given the power source is 
so weak. Seems to me that honing a design for a specific area of need is more 
apt to be accomplished. Cars range from small to large with few to many features 
to accomplish various needs. 


What I have set my sights on is a practical suburban human powered alternate 
transportation vehicle to be  used by average folks to do their shopping and 
running errands in the 2 to 5 mile radius. Average speed 14 mph. These design 
limits give the opportunity to come up with a viable vehicle. 


> You can fairly easily put an aero body on an existing unsuspended trike, but 
>you are likely to end up with many difficulties, including body attachments to 
>the trike, noise of thin shells vibrating, and many others.

........How true this is. But I look at the fact that the bare trike business is 
booming. Although adding a shell of some kind may not be ideal it does change a 
trike into a vehicle, a vehicle that is first of all not seasonably limited, has 
weather protection, some crash protection, more visible to cars  etc. This will 
change the consciousness of the trike rider into using the vehicle more as local 
alternate transportation rather than just recreation. 


Second, by being seen by the public these vehicles will affect their awareness. 
I see and hear a change in the publics response to my VM over a 7 year period. 
They more often comment now - it doesn't use gas, its good for the environment, 
and its good for the health of the rider, etc.  

I am hearing more and more happy - I like what you are doing horn honks  -  from 
drivers. 

The publics environmental awareness is changing. We need a viable practical 
vehicle. 

It doesn't need all the wish list of advanced features. 

I designed my present VM 8 years ago coming from a long background with 
streamliners and the thrill of speed.
What's important to me now is weather protection (head in), light weight, quiet, 
ease of access to decent cargo space, some amount of suspension, small physical 
size for parking reasons. Aerodynamics is there but further down the list. 

This is accomplishable given what we know.  
In another 10 years more viable vehicles will be developed.  

>  I guess we will have to rely on our own ideas and resources for low-budget 
>design and development paths. 
>
.....Yes, but some method of sharing ideas is very important. Look at the 
advancements made after the birth of the IHPVA in 1975   - which eventually lead 
to present day Velomobiles. 


In some ways its less a technology issue than a change in consciousness as to 
why and how we use these vehicles. Requiring the wish list of advanced features 
hints of 19th and 20th century thinking where the Earths energy and resources 
were thought to be limitless. Efficiency - doing more with less - is the 21st 
century password. HPVs are up with the efficiency of railroad trains and super 
tankers.  


Notice for one how I have skirted the issue of funding.

Rob, et al,
I was just about to comment on that.  The objection isn't really to the
cost of the velomobile but to the value since most prospective buyers don't
know the cost.  You may buy a car for $10K USD, but you'll spend about the
same amount every year to fuel, maintain, insure it (and then there's
depreciation - the biggest cost and something you don't even get anything
for).  A few years ago I remember someone sharing a study that showed all
the costs for comparison.  Does anyone still have a link to it?
Thanks,
Nick Hein

Nick - breakdown (including depreciation for different original purchase =

Some of the costs are frightening and make velos - even the most =
expensive ones - look like bargains!

Hi John,

Thanks for your detailed reply. It is good to be back in contact with =
you. In view of your long experience and accomplishments I place a high =
value on what you say. And we old farts need to stick together!

Subject: Re: [Velomobile] Velomobile design

David Eggleston

Thank you for giving your experienced and wide ranging overview on =
various VM issues. Very valuable information.=20
I agree we have a lot yet to learn but we have accomplished a lot in =
these last 10 years of VM development.

>An all-around velo has a better chance of commercial success than one =
that is only good for a few things.
......Too much of a range is asking a lot of a design, given the power =
source is so weak. Seems to me that honing a design for a specific area =
of need is more apt to be accomplished. Cars range from small to large =
with few to many features to accomplish various needs.

>I didn=E2=80=99t mean to denigrate designs focused on narrower goals. =
Taylor Wilhour and Patrick Kirchem used Velocity Velos bodies on trikes, =
but also used PA systems on ROAM. They were constantly trying to find =
receptacles for charging their batteries during lunchtime, etc. They =
also had mechanical problems. But they did both make it to D.C., and =
only missed out on a few days of riding. While their aerodynamics is not =
up to that of the very streamlined velos, their motors and big batteries =
made up for that.
   I admit to being a fan of VM.nl and their design and manufacturing =
work. In the Quest and Mango (and now Strada) they have all-around velos =
that do well in many uses. Good aerodynamics blesses you every time you =
push on the pedals, and I can see why so many find that specification so =
important. Also your safety is enhanced by going fast, so the relative =
velocity differences with respect to traffic are smaller and the =
reaction time after detecting you is in your favor, at least for city =
riding.
   I used to use a PA system we developed, and thought I was getting =
full exercise anyway. Not so. When I visited the NL in 2008, a bit sick =
and jet-lagged and riding a borrowed velo, I was unable to keep up with =
a fast velo group. Marjolein, a 60-year-old very fit lady, drifted back =
to push me so I could keep up. Then I realized that I needed every scrap =
of exercise I could get to approach their level of fitness. I would =
never have been able to train and complete ROAM if I had been relying on =
a PA system previously, unless of course I had a reliable such PA system =
in my Quest. But I am the sailing type that disdains power assist for =
personal use, so have to be content with what my body can do. Also I =
refuse to carry around the extra weight of motor and batteries that I =
don=E2=80=99t really need. I go for a lightweight velo.

What I have set my sights on is a practical suburban human powered =
alternate transportation vehicle to be used by average folks to do their =
shopping and running errands in the 2 to 5 mile radius. Average speed 14 =
mph. These design limits give the opportunity to come up with a viable =
vehicle.

> Go for it!

> You can fairly easily put an aero body on an existing unsuspended =
trike, but you are likely to end up with many difficulties, including =
body attachments to the trike, noise of thin shells vibrating, and many =
others.

........How true this is. But I look at the fact that the bare trike =
business is booming. Although adding a shell of some kind may not be =
ideal it does change a trike into a vehicle, a vehicle that is first of =
all not seasonably limited, has weather protection, some crash =
protection, more visible to cars etc. This will change the consciousness =
of the trike rider into using the vehicle more as local alternate =
transportation rather than just recreation

.> The covered trike needs a lot of cargo space. I=E2=80=99m not sure =
how much the Velocity Velo body has. Maybe it is adequate. One can hope =
that it will change the consciousness.

Second, by being seen by the public these vehicles will affect their =
awareness. I see and hear a change in the publics response to my VM over =
a 7 year period. They more often comment now - it doesn't use gas, its =
good for the environment, and its good for the health of the rider, etc. =

I am hearing more and more happy - I like what you are doing horn honks =
- from drivers.=20
The publics environmental awareness is changing. We need a viable =
practical vehicle.=20
It doesn't need all the wish list of advanced features.

> I get the same reactions, but nobody local orders a velo, not even my =
bike club friends. We are getting a few bike people riding trikes around =
here, whereas two years ago there were none. Nobody locally has gotten =
so far as to notice or want the features on your list. It is a struggle. =
I could have died before such a thing happens. I greatly underestimated =
the trouble of getting people out of their cars to exercise.

I designed my present VM 8 years ago coming from a long background with =
streamliners and the thrill of speed.
What's important to me now is weather protection (head in), light =
weight, quiet, ease of access to decent cargo space, some amount of =
suspension, small physical size for parking reasons. Aerodynamics is =
there but further down the list.=20
This is accomplishable given what we know.=20
In another 10 years more viable vehicles will be developed.=20

> I will be 87 then, if I make it that far. That is a long time to wait.
As regards head-in, Frans van der Merwe=E2=80=99s Pterovelo used a =
breathing tube to minimize inside condensation on ROAM. Others have done =
the same thing. Mary Arneson and her Cab-Bikes didn=E2=80=99t have this =
setup, AFAIK. It would not be a big deal to add it. One of my customers =
living in northern Idaho came up with it on his own. The Dutch aversion =
to it is to some extent justified by the dangers of limiting your visual =
field in any way. If the big vehicles I share the roads with misjudge my =
intentions or fail to see me they could crush me and hardly notice it. =
I=E2=80=99m quite sure they wouldn=E2=80=99t even get a citation for =
doing it. Just a hint of a shadow or an unexpected light beam crossing =
my peripheral vision can scare the hell out of me. It is one of the =
problems of the reclined position combined with age that I can=E2=80=99t =
turn my head far enough to see backwards. Even now I sometimes pull out =
not knowing for sure, but estimating from the lack of vehicle noise that =
it must be safe. Mirrors have limitations too. Sometimes my mirrors show =
nothing, but somebody pulls out and accelerates fast and passes me when =
I had no idea they were there until I hear them. So limiting sound cues =
by enclosing the cockpit is also a worry. Maybe I need a rear-view =
camera and dash-mounted screen for safety.

> I guess we will have to rely on our own ideas and resources for =
low-budget design and development paths.=20
.....Yes, but some method of sharing ideas is very important. Look at =
the advancements made after the birth of the IHPVA in 1975 - which =
eventually lead to present day Velomobiles

. >Yes, but John Abbey states an obvious worry, why should I share my =
ideas so somebody else can profit from them instead of me. At the =
current level of awareness on the hupi list, this is probably not a =
problem, but it is a worry.

In some ways its less a technology issue than a change in consciousness =
as to why and how we use these vehicles. Requiring the wish list of =
advanced features hints of 19th and 20th century thinking where the =
Earths energy and resources were thought to be limitless. Efficiency - =
doing more with less - is the 21st century password. HPVs are up with =
the efficiency of railroad trains and super tankers.

>You must have been reading the same stuff that I have. I ran across the =
transport efficiency and payload efficiency dimensionless parameters in =
the 1960=E2=80=99s or so. They are still valid, a great advantage of =
dimensionless parameters.=20
There is indeed a great discrepancy between the 142 velo crowd of mostly =
Quests and Mangos (and Stradas) at the 2011 Olliebollentocht a few days =
ago, and the local bike scene. I am still in the =E2=80=9Cwatch that =
roadie recede in the rear-view mirror=E2=80=9D crowd. Even as old and =
slow as I am, I now have a carbon fiber Quest that I ordered for ROAM. =
The original was crushed in shipment and I only got a replacement in =
November. Going fast is still important to me. Also, since my friend =
John Abbey is living with us, working for VMUSA, and riding his velo =
with me, and is much younger and faster, I need to have some chance of =
keeping up with him, or at least not getting so far behind that he gives =
up on me.=20
   Ymte uses a cargo trailer on a Quest for bulky packages. That way he =
still has the advantage of a fast vehicle when he drops the trailer. I =
tend to use our car for that, even though I have a cargo trailer, since =
I rarely need it and sometimes the car is necessary for the trip anyway. =
My body fat content was 18.7% according to my Tanita sports scale before =
ROAM, but dropped to 5% afterwards. It is now up to 10%, and unless I =
ride a lot more will keep going up. I am fighting to retain my fitness =
but seem to be losing the battle. I just don=E2=80=99t have time to ride =
enough to stabilize it anymore.

Notice for one how I have skirted the issue of funding.

> Yes, I noticed. The people that require cheap velos may be thinking of =
car production, such as 100,000 vehicles per year, with all the careful =
design, production, and marketing to sell that many velos. That would =
require millions, or maybe billions, as my financial predictions are =
notoriously inaccurate. If a great, inexpensive velo could exist, how =
many people would buy one? There is lots of room for ingenuity in =
design, but whether improvements in consciousness will take place fast =
enough is tough to predict. We keep muddling on anyway.

We had a chance to visit Chet Kyle on our way up to Portland for ROAM. =
He had a crash due to a fawn jumping in front of him a year ago or so, =
and is recovered but not quite the same. He has cleaned out his office =
and cut down or cut out his consulting on bicycle speed. I guess we both =
have to look forward to that sort of thing, unfortunately. I will keep =
at it as long as possible.

[lots of interesting stuff snipped]

Thanks David, I concur with all your points. There's one other that 
might not be uppermost in the minds of people in the USA, but probably 
more so in Europe and Australia: inconsistency of laws relating to 
power-assist. Here in Australia we have a lot of hilly country, coupled 
with brain-snappingly stupid power restrictions (now 200W peak - with 
the possibility of 250W plus pedelec and speed limits soon!)

Any velo is so much heavier than a bicycle that it needs all the help it 
can get uphill - that's where the average speed of any bicycle trip is 
determined, so how much more so for a velo. My own homebuilt attempts at 
streamlining certainly got me to the bottom of the next hill much 
faster, which was fun as long as it lasted, but took me twice as long to 
get up to the top again!

So lobbying for reasonable power limits and restrictions of these things 
is paramount in places that limit them unreasonably. The present laws in 
Oz seem to be specifically designed to prevent practical 
car-alternatives from ever being built.

Hi Giles,

  You make a good point. We have the same problem in the States, although 
the Consumer Products Safety Commission allows up to 1 HP motors for assist, 
as long as the speed is limited to be less than or equal to 20 mph. That 
makes this a national standard. I believe this standard resulted from 
substantial lobbying by electric bike companies.
I understand that California allows motors up to 2 HP and speeds up to 30 
mph, although you need to have a driver's license to qualify. As a practical 
matter, no governmental bodies seem to be interested in enforcing these 
speeds or power levels, so they only have the effect of limiting what 
manufacturers can sell. Otherwise it is likely nobody would notice 
violations of this law unless lawyers got involved.

Thanks David, I concur with all your points. There's one other that
might not be uppermost in the minds of people in the USA, but probably
more so in Europe and Australia: inconsistency of laws relating to
power-assist. Here in Australia we have a lot of hilly country, coupled
with brain-snappingly stupid power restrictions (now 200W peak - with
the possibility of 250W plus pedelec and speed limits soon!)

Any velo is so much heavier than a bicycle that it needs all the help it
can get uphill - that's where the average speed of any bicycle trip is
determined, so how much more so for a velo. My own homebuilt attempts at
streamlining certainly got me to the bottom of the next hill much
faster, which was fun as long as it lasted, but took me twice as long to
get up to the top again!

So lobbying for reasonable power limits and restrictions of these things
is paramount in places that limit them unreasonably. The present laws in
Oz seem to be specifically designed to prevent practical
car-alternatives from ever being built.

The liability costs following a collision could be a big problem though.

I'd like it if there _were_ any companies to do lobbying here - people 
have tried to sell these things, but nobody lasts long in the business. 
They always seemed to be bickering, fragmented and demoralised.

When lawyers got involved, and if there was substantial damage or 
injury, you can bet the rules would change real quick.

Hi Everyone,
  I joined this list years ago hoping to get inspired into building a velom=
obile.  Young children, landscaping and an unenthusiastic wife have gotten =
in the way.  So I still have a trike aero shell hanging in my garage but no=
 trike or progress.  I am not sure if I will be able to contribute this lis=
t but I'll throw some requirements for the sort of velo I'd like.

1. Cost: Under $5k.  Rotovelo comes close but has other down sides. I will =
have to buy a second car soon which will be about $10k, travel 5k km a year=
 and cost 4k a year in parts and depreciation.  However the benefits are we=
ll known and shareable.  I currently have 12k km up on my bike over 12 year=
s however a good velomobile might see 5-10k km a year.  Considering a suspe=
nded trike costs about $5k this price maybe too optimistic.

2. Speed: 32km/h. Current commute is 35minutes at 22km/h on the bike.  Spee=
d increases versatility.  Lifting the average speed to 32km/h (20mph) would=
 cut commute to 25minutes.  Interestingly if my commute has 30% uphill at 2=
0km/h, 30% downhill at 60km/h and 40% flat at 40km/h the average speed is a=
bout 32km/h.  Wind kill downhill and flat speed, weight kills uphill speed =
and weight kills uphill speed.  Uphill contributes more to longer trip time=
s than fast downhill removes.

3. Power assist.  Australia may have a limit of 200W but I tell you an unfi=
t person riding an assisted bike is difficult to keep up with.  The biggest=
 contributor to the weight of vehicle is the rider not the vehicle.  If a g=
ood cyclist puts out 300W and weigh 100kg including the bike, then adding 2=
00W and 30kg is equivalent to the original cyclist with a total weight of j=
ust 80kg.  Power assist is also essential for cargo capacity as the weight =
kills performance so much.  Trike builders tend to by HPV purists and elect=
ric assist is not a common option.  Batteries are really heavy anymore so s=
peed governs range more than battery weight.

4. Cargo capacity: 1+1.  The ability to cram in a passenger or cargo makes =
the velo more than just a toy.  This is the biggest problem with the trike =
plus fairing option.  There are very few 1+1 trikes primarily because of th=
e lack of power assist I suspect.  To be useful the cargo capacity must be =
inside the weather shell.

5. Weather protection.  Both rider and cargo need protection.  Lack of weat=
her protection will halve the number of days it can be used and renders it =
not much better than a trike.

6. Suspension: Canberra bike paths are full of tree roots and ramps.

7. Safety.  There is not a big motorcycle culture in Australia.  People I k=
now who rode motor cycles generally stopped after their first accident.  Ca=
nberra has largely segregated cycle ways making velo usage possible.  I wou=
ld not be riding a velo on the open road.  It is no better than motorcycle =
and lacks the power to get out of the way of blind motorists.  First assump=
tion on a bike is the motorist is dumb.  If the velo is hooking downhill at=
 60km/h I would also want protection in case control is lost.  Rolling, sli=
ding or hitting a tree.  Generally I'm thinking of seat belts, full face he=
lmets and impact absorbing shell (such as a honeycomb shell).

Hello,
would you consider the Twike still a velomobile? =
http://www.twike.com/en/home/home.html

It has many of the features that we're talking about. Of course it is =
much wider that conventional velomobiles, but I think that right now =
we're talking of something like an evolution of the velomobile typology, =
closer to a full-featured vehicle regarding safety etc.
On their website you can read they sold 900 units in 10 years, around =
90/year.

BTW, I have no idea of the Twike price=85 Anyone?

If you read info about twike carefully, you find that you could not be

Its a bit far away for me being in Australia but I'd love to attend 
something like that.
Hope to see a write up and pictures on line.
I finally have a velo. Its a Mango Sport. Wish I'd had it when I was 
younger and fitter though.

Reluctantly I am shutting down these lists soon.
The pipermail archives will remain online indefinitely.

hpv
hpv-forsale
hpv-boats
trikes
velomobile
vph

If someone wants to port any of them to another place I can provide you
with the subscriber list. Write to me directly if you want information.

Message volume is so low that I don't think it's worth the effort to move
them again.
