Hi Rick,

Congratulations on a successful completion of the Murray Marathon and a great fund raising event for a worthy cause. That's a fine looking boat you have built but I can't wait to see the next one. Your report on the race was excellent, keep up the good work.

Bruce Plazyk

re Rick,

A very cool looking setup.

Is the shaft simply a flexible rod, or is it a cable of some sort?

Thank you,

Mark A. Vermilion

Shaft is 8mm thick spring steel.  In the configuration shown it is expected to
achieve infinite fatigue life. I paint it to reduce corrosion.  There are some
high strength stainless steels available but I have
 not been able to readily
procure them in the size I need.

This was a great result and report and i have only 2 comments

I would have thought that you would have had  a spare prop that could be 
easily fitted.

I have commented this before but consider if it did not increase the drag 
then a folding prop could have been an addvantage
.

The spare prop - I did think about this.  I had a spare and shaft  
made up complete with coupling for gearbox and flexible strut.  I  
carried it in the car but of course I would still need to finish the  
day if I was going to use it.  I carried a paddle on the boat as this  
covers all propulsion contingencies including things like broken  
chain or gearbox failure.   By the way I never used the paddle in the  
entire time.  I never carry on at the local lake.  The boat operates  
in less than 6" of water so I can launch faster than most kayaks.   
Fitting my cycling shoes takes a bit of time because I wear socks to  
avoid blisters.  (The paddlers have to wear gloves.  Some end up with  
sores on their backside from sitting in water for long periods and  
resulting abrasion.)

Most boats carry a roll of duct tape to do quick hull repairs and I  
also carry some basic tools such as keys to tighten the prop and  
multi-tool for anything else.  Of course spares and tools add weight  
but my shaft and prop are lighter than most paddles.

I have a few thousand kilometers on the gearbox I use most and It is  
usually operated within its rating so is proving very reliable.  I  
should renew the chain a bit before the race if I do it again.  So I  
am giving serious thought to ditching the paddle and just carry a  
spare shaft and prop.  I am also thinking about a more compliant  
prop, a smaller diameter prop and a stronger carbon fibre prop.  The  
existing one is low temper 304 stainless steel so was not real  
difficult to straighten.

The current 8mm shaft should give infinite fatigue life but I only  
had time to get about 500km on the original shaft.  I fitted a new  
one before the race so I had some confidence it would do the race.   
However I would also carry a spare shaft if I had a spare prop.  I  
was surprised I did not bend it when I bent the blade.  8mm diameter  
is quite thin but being spring steel it has tremendous toughness and  
high yield stress.

Folding prop- I have not really thought about the folding prop.  I am  
hopeful of buying a benchtop lathe this year and a folding prop  
sounds like a good idea for an early project.  It may actually shed  
weed very well if I just stop spinning.  It will also coast better  
but still run in reverse.  These are real advantages.  I am sure I  
can fabricate one that would not lose much performance.

It is interesting with weed and even leaves on the prop.  They are  
guided down the shaft into the prop.  The shaft shields the strut.   
So most weed wraps around the prop blades rather than just getting  
caught  on the strut.  If it did this it would be cut up by the prop  
but it just trails off the blades.  On the hot part of the day the  
trees shed leaves and these are driven to some points in the river by  
the wind such that they form a complete carpet. These are small  
leaves about 4" long and quite stiff because they are sun baked but I  
still manage to get a few caught on the blades.  The water is soil  
laden and murky so you have to stop rotating and pull the prop up to  
see if it is fouled in any way.  It would be great to just stop  
pedalling and have it shed weed without much loss in speed.

If you look at my speed plots you will see regular speed dips to  
about 5kph. Most of these are the times I inspect the prop. I usually  
combined it with taking a sip of water and maybe having a snack.   
Most kayakers use a drinking tube but with my free hands I just use  
an ordinary drinking bottle.  I even have the cycle style holder for  
the standard bottle.  I usually carried five of these but always had  
at least one left.  It was relatively cool this year.

Rick Willoughby

this it would be cut up by the prop but it just trails off the blades.  On =
the
hot part of the day the trees shed leaves and these are driven to some poin=

the river by the wind such that they form a complete carpet. These are smal=

leaves about 4" long and quite stiff because they are sun baked but I still
manage to get a few caught on the blades.  The water is soil laden and murk=

you have to stop rotating and pull the prop up to see if it is fouled in an=

much loss in speed.

If you look at my speed plots you will see regular speed dips to about 5kph=

Most of these are the times I inspect the prop. I usually combined it with
taking a sip of water and maybe having a snack.  Most kayakers use a drinki=

tube but with my free hands I just use an ordinary drinking bottle.  I even=
 have
the cycle style holder for the standard bottle.  I usually carried five of =
these
but always had at least one left.  It was relatively cool this year.

Rick,
?
Can't you pedal backwards to rmove the weeds & leaves?
?
Neal

Pedaling backwards is never reliable.  It will normally remove leaves  
but not long marine weed.  Also it means you have to go in reverse to  
reverse the flow.  By lifting the prop clear of the water I can  
maintain some speed in coast and I am guaranteed the weed is clear.   
You have to be able to see the prop to make sure it is clean.   
Actually removing the weed by hand is the fastest way.  Weed is a  
serious issue for a pedal boat compared with a paddles boat.

If you are pushing hard for a long period with variable wind with  
variable current it is hard to get the required inputs to know the  
prop is fouled. It s very depressing if you get around to inspecting  
the prop and find it fouled.  You know you have wasted energy and  
that is the last thing you want to know in an endurance event.  I had  
a practice of checking the prop at least every hour and if there was  
a lot of weed I would do it more often.

If you are pacing with another boat of very similar ability it is  
possible to detect something on the prop as you find heart rate is  
building but still just pacing.  If there is variable head wind then  
this does not work because the paddler loses more speed than I do.

Hi Everybody,

This is to let you know that we are in the process of developing a new pedal
boat to go with our Escapade and Encore (the Sprite is now out of production
but this new boat may also be called Sprite).

This boat will also be a "cruising" boat - as are our others - rather than
"performance" as many of you focus on.

In philosophical size it will fall between the Escapade and Encore, but will
actually be shorter than the Escapade at 11 feet long.  It will be a two
person boat, sitting side by side, with a 4 foot beam.

The big difference is that the drive system(s)will be a composite, drop in,
swing down/up type rather than the built-in system of our other boats.  The
main reason for doing this so we can have a boat that can be packaged and
shipped reasonably.  (An Encore can cost $1000 or more to ship in today's
freight market, and this doesn't work for a $3500 product.)

This boat will be rotomolded as are our others.  It was designed by Tom
Parker of Parker Designs (who also did the original Sprite and Encore).  The
mold is now being built and should be in our plant in a month or so.
Development of it is expected to take most of the season but hopefully will
become production worthy later on in the summer.

Best Wishes to everyone.

Curt Chambers
Nauticraft Corp.

While there may not be a lot of activity it would be a shame

There was a recent flurry of activity from parties interested in the  
SpinFin molds, but nothing got built.  The ice is still on the better  
lakes up here.  I do wonder sometimes if the archives  from the old  
"hpv-boats@ihpva.org" list are available.

Best,
Bob Stuart

We are doing house cleaning on the server and my guess is no one would

Hello Brian,

I would miss it.

Participation and contribution have always varied considerably with 
time on this forum.

When some of the more high-powered contributors defect to a different 
forum, those wishing to benefit from their input, out of necessity, 
can be expected to follow.

However, IMO, the atmosphere of this forum has been unique, 
occasional warts and all,...and more than that, for years it was THE 
forum for the home-designer/builder of hpb's.

The atmosphere I mention depends, of course, on the personalities who 
make up the forum at any given time. The fact that some of the most 
productive and knowledgeable members have taken up residency 
elsewhere may mean that participation here will never reach former 
levels.

But it seems to me that there has been a maturation of the 
field,...and as more people with higher math skills have appeared in 
the forum, and computer programs have been developed to do much of 
the hull/prop, etc. design work,the "fun" of relative amateurs 
playing with ideas and experimenting has to some degree been lost. 
I.e., "Its been done" is increasingly a valid, if discouraging 
observation.

This forum served well for a long time, and perhaps could be 
maintained as more of an "entry level" site for those only beginning 
to explore hpb concepts, ...while the higher-tech design forums are 
offering "state of the art" info for those best able to make use of 
or contribute to it.

I am remembering that apple-box scooters with skate wheels nailed on 
the bottom are a lot of fun for those not at the forefront of 
ever-advancing vehicle design. I would feel that something had been 
lost if there were no place where these people could feel "at home". 
I am sure that nearly all of the most advanced among us can remember 
the thrill of discovering and meeting the many challenges encountered 
in the "early days" of participation in the field. A certain spirit 
of "play" diminishes as envelope pushing demands always higher 
education/more specialized skills/exotic materials, etc. The 
acquisition of these elements can become a serious, rather than a 
lightly-taken endeavor.

The archives of this forum contain a treasure not to be indifferently 
discarded. Not the Library of Alexandria, perhaps, but a wealth of 
material of interest for everyone who is building an education, 
rather than attempting to jump in at the cutting edge.

Two cents from a long-toothed member.

Best wishes to all,

Larry

Larry,

Very well articulated. I agree with your thoughts.

Thank you.

Hello Brian,

I would miss it.

Participation and contribution have always varied considerably with=A0
time on this forum.

When some of the more high-powered contributors defect to a different=A0
forum, those wishing to benefit from their input, out of necessity,=A0
can be expected to follow.

However, IMO, the atmosphere of this forum has been unique,=A0
occasional warts and all,...and more than that, for years it was THE=A0
forum for the home-designer/builder of hpb's.

The atmosphere I mention depends, of course, on the personalities who=A0
make up the forum at any given time. The fact that some of the most=A0
productive and knowledgeable members have taken up residency=A0
elsewhere may mean that participation here will never reach former=A0
levels.

But it seems to me that there has been a maturation of the=A0
field,...and as more people with higher math skills have appeared in=A0
the forum, and computer programs have been developed to do much of=A0
the hull/prop, etc. design work,the "fun" of relative amateurs=A0
playing with ideas and experimenting has to some degree been lost.=A0
I.e., "Its been done" is increasingly a valid, if discouraging=A0
observation.

This forum served well for a long time, and perhaps could be=A0
maintained as more of an "entry level" site for those only beginning=A0
to explore hpb concepts, ...while the higher-tech design forums are=A0
offering "state of the art" info for those best able to make use of=A0
or contribute to it.

I am remembering that apple-box scooters with skate wheels nailed on=A0
the bottom are a lot of fun for those not at the forefront of=A0
ever-advancing vehicle design. I would feel that something had been=A0
lost if there were no place where these people could feel "at home".=A0
I am sure that nearly all of the most advanced among us can remember=A0
the thrill of discovering and meeting the many challenges encountered=A0
in the "early days" of participation in the field. A certain spirit=A0
of "play" diminishes as envelope pushing demands always higher=A0
education/more specialized skills/exotic materials, etc. The=A0
acquisition of these elements can become a serious, rather than a=A0
lightly-taken endeavor.

The archives of this forum contain a treasure not to be indifferently=A0
discarded. Not the Library of Alexandria, perhaps, but a wealth of=A0
material of interest for everyone who is building an education,=A0
rather than attempting to jump in at the cutting edge.

Two cents from a long-toothed member.

Best wishes to all,

Larry

There has been little activity but I still monitor the site and dig  
into archives now and then.

There are some pedal power threads in BoatDesign and I think more  
people are at least thinking about this sort of boat.  I promote the  
idea there.

I am on to V14 now.  It will be my last pedal boat.  I am fairing the  
hull this weekend,  It is carbon fibre composite.  Before I started  
fairing it weighed in at 9.9kg.  Fairing and paint will add about  
2kg.  Linked picture shows the hull formed up before deck was placed:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/v14_Formed.jpg

I have made carbon fibre frame and outriggers for the latest boat and  
they are in use on V11J.  The frame with seat, gearbox and crank  
weighs 4kg.  Each outrigger weighs 1kg.  You might see I am anal  
about weight but I have found 15kg is infinitely easier for me to  
carry around than 25kg:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_CF_Frame.JPG

This is a rendering I did for a heavier rider for operation in more  
open water:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/KA77.jpg

I have had a young rider on V11J who can hold 16kph over 1000m.  He  
could go further but runs out of lake.

Hi Rick,

It is good to hear from you again.

Did you make your own CF skin panels for V14? Are they single layers
or a sandwich?

Also, it appears to have the same or at least similar lines to V11.
Is it a CF clone?

Best regards,

Michael Lampi

Hi Bob,

Just out of curiosity, what would be the "all-up" cost of making a Spin-Fin?

Better still, what would the cost be for a version that used an
integrated right angle gear box rather than a twisted chain,
where the gearbox housing was part of the SpinFin itself?

This would be similar to the WaveWalker drive system, and would
probably be a little beefier than your original drive.

I don't know.  A couple of hundred hours at racing speeds between  
quick, cheap re-builds seemed like beefy enough to me.  I'm sure that  
equal-quality gears would put the cost up.

Best,
Bob Stuart

Mike
I made the CF panels at home.  This boat is 6m long and is not a  
clone.  It is designed for flat panel construction and shape is  
optimised for this.  It should require 2% less power than V11J  
because I can build it about 8kg lighter.  A hard chine hull is not  
quite as efficient as a rounded chine but it is much faster to build  
unless you have a mould and, if lighter, it can be a better overall  
boat.

I do not use vacuum bagging for my panels but this is no doubt the  
best way.  I lay out cardboard on a flat concrete floor and this is  
covered with plastic.  I then place the sheets of klegecell (Corecell  
would be better), spread epoxy over these then roll out 200gsm bi- 
axial CF cloth.  This is then liberally coated with epoxy. A thicker  
coating of epoxy on a light layup improves compressive strength  
immensely so is worth the weight.  I then lay a smooth layer of  
plastic over the CF and place chipboard sheets on top of this.  Final  
step is to load the boards with weight.  (I do not have a vacuum pump  
and cannot stand running a vacuum cleaner until the epoxy cues.)  I  
repeat the process after rolling the panel over but only after the  
first side has cured.

This is a very good method of construction and gives drum like  
strength.  You can get a basic hull built with about 8 hours effort.  
The time for curing takes much longer of course.

Greg K is presently building his ocean boat and is using flat panel  
construction.  He is being helped by a fellow who does CF parts for  
aircraft but not to recognised standards so I have given Greg some  
ideas on testing the panels to ensure quality control.  The test  
panels they made were quite good on test.  If you track back through  
his blog you will get some details:
http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/HPB/HPBmain.html


Hi Rick,


It is good to hear from you again.

Did you make your own CF skin panels for V14? Are they single layers
or a sandwich?

Also, it appears to have the same or at least similar lines to V11.
Is it a CF clone?

Best regards,

Michael Lampi

I have thought about it.  The CF would probably not be as good as  
fibreglass.  I have tried CF tent poles for shafts but the fibres are  
not oriented for carrying shear.  I have intentions to wrap a 1/4"  
spring steel shaft with fibreglass tape and test that.  The  
fibreglass would carry most of the torque.  The steel would primarily  
be the former.   The fibreglass should protect the steel from corrosion.

Beppe

I have been working on my solar boat design.  I have started testing  
the componentry.  I need to get my hands on a nice solar panel and  
see what it can do.  If I keep making pedal boats I will not get to  
do what I always planned to do.  Pedal boats are my large scale  
models for something big enough for coastal cruising.

Hi Rick

 >>>I am on to V14 now.  It will be my last pedal boat.
Why your last?

not really an HPB... Don't suppose your posting on boatdesign.com about it
are you?

Alex
I have posted some details there.  I went down one path for quite a  
bit.  Even got some rough scantlings done but then a fellow provided  
a new direction that I have been exploring.  It is very promising.

The boat sketched on this link will do 8kts with 900W if I can build  
it to target weight:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/swt_8m.jpg
I have dubbed it a faux-tri because it is a monohul with outriggers  
underwater but looks like a standard monohull topside.  It has better  
accommodation and is shorter than the previous attempt.  It uses many  
of the ideas I have got from pedal boats.  This is partly why I am  
making a flat panel pedal boat because the solar boat will use this  
method and I want to know what is involved.   With the Mars motor I  
currently have this boat should see about 14kts at full tilt.  The  
batteries would drain quickly at this pace though.  I have priced  
lithium batteries and intend to play around with a small battery on  
one of the pedal boats.  We have a solar boat challenge in Australia  
and I might convert a pedal boat to run in this as an interim step.

I am yet to see if it can be built within the weight target.


Rick, I hope you'll keep us posted on your solar boat though, even if  
it's
not really an HPB... Don't suppose your posting on boatdesign.com  
about it
are you?

Alex

Hi Rick,

Can you explain a bit about the underwater outrigger concept, or link 
to where it has been discussed?

I'm guessing the idea is to avoid choppy water aka-ama wave impact 
and surface wave-making,...but am puzzled about the roll-countering 
effect without the buoyancy/leverage advantages.

Thanks,

Larry

I've done OK using salvaged refrigerator compressors as vacuum  
pumps.  With no internal flow, they heat up, but wet rags wicking  
moisture from a tray, and sometimes a small fan, will keep them cool  
enough. I recommend "dry bagging" using a squeegee to move excess  
resin to the vacuum ports, which are equipped to collect it safely.

Larry
The idea with the faux-tri is to get a slender hull in the water but  
use outriggers just above the water level for stabilising.  The top  
part provides more room than a long slender hull but is shorter and  
more practical for a trailer.

The linesplan on this link might give you a better idea. From the in- 
water perspective it is just a heavier version of V11J.

>Hi Rick,


I cannot open the lines link on my equipment, but no matter. I had 
simply misread your intended meaning.

>Of course I understand your statement in this last post - "use 
>outriggers just above the water level for stabilising".

Vs. (what I could not envision ;-)

>"it *is* a monohull with  *outriggers underwater* but looks like a 
>standard monohull topside."

I couldn't see the merits of "outriggers underwater". Of course if 
the boat looks like (rather than is) a "monohull with outriggers" 
when seen from "underwater", I read you clearly.

Thanks,

Larry

Rick, saw your rendering for a decked in boat for use in open water, would =
the seat well be self draining? I have taken my boat out on the bay 4 times=
 now ,on calm days with the biggest waves at 6". Even then it behaves like =
a submarine, its hardest to handle going before the waves at a 45 deg angle=
 as the boat digs in . Maybe a surfski with a drive leg and two outriggers =
might be the best layout for an open water hpb as the surfski is a proven d=
esign and have the outriggers the same as for an OC1.

Having had quite a bit of experience with pedal boating in water
with waves of up to 8 feet, I generally concur that a pedal boat
with a minimal or no cockpit (or at least a self-bailing one) and
flying amas would generally be the best configuration.

Even with a surfski hull you can find the bow and/or stern digging
into the waves. You just don't want them to stay there.

The Cadence configuration with outriggers has worked out pretty well,
with a propeller directly in front of the stern rudder. That
configuration works far better for maneuvering in the big waves than
one where the prop wash and the rudder are separated by several feet.

Once out in open water, I never have trouble maintaining enough way  
for steerage.  However, when surfing, I have sometimes wound up with  
my rudder in the air.  A deeper blade seems to help.

Ian
If the deck is self draning then driving down waves does not matter much.  You just get very wet.  I am surprised you have problems in 6" waves.

V11J can be driven into the back of waves maybe 0.4m high and higher.  I have had the bow submerged for about 2m of its length and believe I could push it deeper if I kept powering.  This hull has virtually zero rocker, a rounded section forward, no hull flare and the same reserve buoyancy bow and stern.

The design for V14 has a flat entry at the bow with quite a lot of rocker that should provide dynamic lift.  The bow is flared and almost 200mm above water level so as it is pushed deeper it will gain considerably more buoyancy.  The stern has very lttle buoyancy so will have little tendency to lift in a following sea. Keeping the stern low helps in keeping the bow up. 

I expect V14 will behave better in a following sea than V11J.  I will have some comparison in a few weeks.  

There could be some advantage in having outriggers with ability to lift but I do not do enough rough water testing to comment from actual experience.  

The OC1 does not bury the bow in a following sea.  Going to windward it takes water into the footwell, which does not self-drain so this is annoying.  Its banana shaped outrigger has a tendency to tip the boat when you travel downwind because it sets up a roll.  Would be better with two outriggers. Despite the bow burying nature of V11J it is a safer boat in "rough" water than the OC1 with a single outrigger.

Rick
        Am being cautious out on the bay, I go from
Patterson River, if its too rough I stay in the river.
Boat has 100mm freeboard so is very wet and dives
into every wave. I have fitted a breakwater and this helps,
I thought of moving the outriggers further forward so=20
when running down the waves I would get better lift
and not keep diving.
         The flex shaft is working well but when I try
peddling hard I can feel a dead spot, like I can't push any harder.=20
         I have been thinking of getting a 1:1 right angle
gearbox and joining it to the involute gear box to make a
drive leg. Advantage would be launch and transport a
lot easier. But more drag and sealing the underwater
gearbox might be a problem.
        Went to the lake last Saturday and its the worst
it's been for weeds, had to stop at least 4 times to clear
them.

The lake will be a mess unless Melbourne gets good rain.  The weed in the northern half is now growing to the surface.   I will use it for testing but will be travelling further for exercising unless it gets deeper.

Hello all

It's good to see some activity in this forum again.. Although I don't speak up often I really enjoy the discussions here.

If anyone is interested, here is a link to a web archive server that has a lot of the early hpv-boat forum discussions: 

http://web.archive.org/web/20050403170308/www.ihpva.org/pipermail/hpv-boats/ 

 It doesn't seem to have everything but there are a lot of discussions available. Also the server seems to get bogged down occassionally but try again in a few minutes. It's a great source for finding old web pages. Here is the link to the archive server: 

http://www.archive.org/index.php 

I also have about 2000 old posts
 going back to September of 2005 if someone needs specific information on a subject.

Late this summer a few of us here at SIGAL Construction are competing in
the Associated Builders & Contractors "Boat Battle". The boats are to be
constructed of materials that are used in construction (with a little
leeway). The basis of our design is the pedal/pontoon boat from the 1953
*/- "Boy Mechanic magazine. This uses a bicycle frame and a ring and
pinion from a differential. We really need some help with the propeller.
Can they be purchased from a fabricator or does each builder make their
own.=20
Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to offer,

I've done fine with model airplane props, but they have to be geared  
up at 1:7 or higher.  A few large, coarse-pitch props have been sold  
between friends.

After winning one instant boat competition too easily, the use of  
metal roofing and duct tape for hull construction were banned there.   
The keel usually comes out hogged, but it is still very slippery, and  
the extra tracking ability can be an advantage with sails.

Best,
Bob

Gene
Bolly produce a boat prop that has a decent pitch:
http://www.bolly.com.au/models/glasstwo.html
It is about midway down the page. The 15 X 25.  This is very strong.   
It will suit providing the hull moves easily.

The best boat will be a long slender stabilised monohull.  The hull  
about 7m long and 10 inches wide if it is a single pilot.  Use  
outriggers on either side to stabilise but set them on the loaded  
water level.  They should only kiss the water in operation.

You can make a prop in about 4 hours using mild steel with a welder  
and grinder.  If you want to have a go then I can lead you through  
the process.

This place has some solid model plane props that might do the job  
with the right gearing:
http://www.hobbycity.com/hobbycity/store/uh_viewItem.asp? 
idProduct=8081&Product_Name=Master_Airscrew_propeller_16x10
You can see it will need to spin about twice as fast at the Bolly  
boat prop at the same speed.  If your boat is not very efficient then  
this prop could be more suitable.  Hobby City have heaps of props but  
this about the best they have for a single person pedal boat.  If you  
can find one of similar diameter with larger pitch then that will be  
more suitable.

I finished V14 today and took it for a short run.

It gets to 11kph quite easily.  Probably a little harder to get to  
above 12kph than V11J but then has a higher top speed.  I have  
already hit 17.3kph without any tuning.

I have some pictures here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V14.htm

The bare hull ended up weighing 11.5kg after painting.  With rudders  
and drive frame it is 19kg.  The outriggers add 3kg more. I have made  
the outriggers plug-in so they are transported separately to the main  
hull.  The main hull is light enough and ballances well enough to be  
carried in one hand using the frame as a handle.

Impressive specs and performance, and nice work as usual, Rick!

Would love to watch you build one of these things, start to finish.

A Talented (and prolific) designer/builder, to say the least!

Thanks for sharing the photos.

I kept a tally on the time to build the hull.  I did it over 5 week  
ends but actual work time was 38 hours.  Most of the time was waiting  
for epoxy or paint to cure.

A rough breakup of the time is:
Weekend 1: Make CF-Klegecell flat panels including cutting - 10 hours
Weekend 2: Build stations frame and join panels - 8.5 hours.
Weekend 3: Fair the hull - 4 hours
Weekend 4; Sand hull, set mounting points - 4.5 hours
Weekend 5: Paint and fit drive and rudders - 11 hours

I have photos of what I did but there are much more detailed ones here:
http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/HPB/HPBmain.html
Greg has employed a fellow competent with CF layup although not an  
experienced boat builder.  He is doing a nice job.  Of course this  
boat will be 4 to 5 times heavier than mine.  Estimate for the bare  
hull is 52kg but it has three separate watertight compartments, is 8m  
long and almost 1m beam.

My panels are very simple with just one layer of 200gsm biaxial CF  
either side of 3mm foam.  Even this is very stiff although less than  
4mm thick overall.  I used 450gsm glass tape on the outside of the  
bottom seam to give it some wear resistance.  It added a bit more  
weight but it means I can treat it roughly without fear of damaging  
the CF.

This whole boat does not have a weld in any of the parts.  That is a  
first for me.  I bought an expensive TIG welder and now I am not  
using it!  Actually the prop is fabricated stainless steel so some  
welding there.  I do have a CF Bolly prop I could try on it.  Still  
to make my folding prop.

Those pics are impressive Rick !

Do you rise up in the water at all during your hi speed
runs ?   I was just wondering as I sort of call your
hull shape a battle ship nosed shape.  I guess there
are no planeing  forces that would create any lift
at speed.  It that what has been proven the fastest for
our type boats ?

I have a dual pontoon hydrobike that I envisioned
playing around with perhaps swapping each short pontoon
with a long surfboard or wind surfer board.

I also obtained some used helicopter blades for use
as submerged foils someday.

I think I am getting some lift above 15kph as it seems to respond  
well to higher power level.  It is a flat on the bottom but very  
narrow.  It also has a canoe stern, which would not offer much lift.   
It would take about 2kW to get it fully on the plane.  I can generate  
about 600W so a long way short.

If you were going to make a planing hull your best option would be  
something about 3m long with a shallow 'V' of say 5 degrees.  You  
would locate your body about 1m from the stern.  The hull would have  
about 0.6m beam and the transom would be full width.  If you built it  
really light so total weight was around 90kg you might get it to  
plane if you could produce about 1.2kW.  This power level is not  
beyond a sprint cyclist but well beyond most.

There is no doubt that you can fly with good foils.  Again it is  
really important to build light.  I have corresponded on this aspect  
with Mark Drella and he believes they needed about 220W as the  
minimum power to fly faster than you can go in an optimised  
displacement hull.  You need to design well to achieve this but  
having good foils is a starting point.

I went here   http://www.boatdesign.com/
expecting to find some kind of discussion or forum.

Is this the link others are referring to for postings
on other topics ?

This is the site Alex referred to:
http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/
He got the .com wrong.

I started this thread for pedal powered boats:
http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/boat-design/pedal-powered- 
boats-23345-20.html
There are some recent posts with V14 build photos and the same test  
ones I have on my site.

Hey Everybody,
 
 
Looks like this list is lighting up.
 
 
I dunno how active I'll be in the near future. All my web-energy is towards 
reinstalling the site. The host that I was under has gone out of business. 
The site is back up, but I have much to do in reconnecting the links and 
posting the rest of the pages. 
 
Went from Elkhart to Bristol the other day via water. It was the first time 
I took a deep draft boat up that far. The last time we went upstream we 
were at the Fun Ride of the Shutt Memorial Hydrobowl. We got stopped by sand 
bars about a third of the way up. This time there was good storms in March and 
Spring runnoff. Went 17 miles without qan incident. 
 
There is usually an athletic festival here over Memorial Day called the 
"Great Race" that has been held for the last thirty years. I'd usually do a 
couple of the events, usually the canoe, always the swim. On a couple of 
occasions, I'd take the rig down the Elkhart River if the usually "marshy" water 
was in rare form and deep enough.
 
The great race has gone out of business, so I'll be itching to try 
something over the holiday. The St Joe has dropped a foot so we'll have to see (my 
big hawg propellers usually draw a couple).
 
Also, I think Daniel has an event on Father's day. If I'm around, I might 
take a stab. It's in St Joe MI; the more the merrier, but let's make sure 
he's doing it.

To all who are creating the din on "flying" outriggers:
 
Continuing the dialogue of making outriggers touch less and less, and 
considering having one in and the other out, and so on,
 
The absolute best way to counter the tipping moment of a long unstable  
monohull is to use AMMAVONS. Counter the tipping moment with a surface skimmer 
"sweep" and completely retract them when there is no tipping. That is the 
best solution with the least drag. 
 
It is the absolute coolest feeling to be surging forward with only the 
monohull in the water in between corrections made from swivel-retractable 
outriggers.

Hi Jake,

Can you provide images(or a link to some)?

When and how are the sweeps activated?

Thanks,

Larry

Hi
I am part of the organizing committee of a large scale event (>100.000
visitors) in France in 2010
We would like to integrate a human powered boat speed competition in the
event.
I am looking for contact points or contributors within this group, for a
first brainstorming.
Looking fwd to hear from you
Philippe (frenchman currently based in Singapore)

Salut Philippe

I'm currently based in Brittany, but would love to be involved in your human
powered boat speed competition. I'm currently asking myself which large
scale event this can be, is it Brest 2010?

Aside from my interest in HPB's I also work as a translator French - English
so if I can be of any assistance then I am very happy to do so.

Yours

Alex Richards

Hello Alex,

Perhaps you can help me with a bit of translation ;-)

Please pardon my ignorance regarding this statement from Philippe:

"I am part of the organizing committee of a large scale event (>100.000
>  visitors) in France in 2010"

I have been puzzled for some time  by the custom of using the decimal 
point or "period" as has been done by Philippe.

In America, the figure, as he gives it, would indicate one hundred 
and zero thousandths visitors.

I take it he means one hundred thousand visitors.

How do the French indicate decimal fractions 
(tenths/hundredths/thousandths, etc.)?

Thanks,

Larry

Hi
Yes, I meant 100 kilo visitors, or 100000
French write thousands in this way : 100.000 and decimals in this way
0,2=20
Cheers
:)

Greetings All,

 

I was just reading the archives and was concerned with the "Still Alive"
thread as I'm just now gathering information for a boat or boats I want to
build.  Maybe with my many novice inqueries I can stir a little more
activity.  

 

So a couple of questions about the list:  I only noticed archives for 2009,
is this all there is?  Are the archives searchable someplace?  Was the list
only started this year?  I suspect not.  

 

That will do for now on this thread.

Thanks,

Ken

 

There are three kinds of people in this world,

Those who can count, and those who can't.

Dennis
The so-called canoe stern is the most efficient hull form for  
displacement mode.  This is the operating mode for low power that  
humans can generate for the period of time to cover 8km.

If you can produce something like 20W/kg of body weight during a  
sprint then you could get a very light boat to plane.  In this case a  
wide transom would be best and the boat would be quite short.  It  
would not be very good for lower power long distance operation though.

V14 has a flat bottom although it is only 200mm wide at the maximum.   
It has quite a lot of rocker in the hull and tends to lift at speed.  
I got it up to 18kph yesterday after I had done a training stint of  
20km so my legs were not at their strongest. It responds better to  
power than V11J.  I would have been producing around 500W for the  
sprint yesterday.

A great feature of the V14 hull is the ease of flat panel  
construction.  It can be built very quickly.  In 4mm ply it will be  
nice and light and strength should be OK. Using fibreglass tape on  
the seams will make it nice and tight.

You can get to the search engine in a number of ways.  Possibly the  
easiest is to use this link:
http://search.gmane.org/
Then paste the following in the group to search.
gmane.culture.transportation.humanpowered.boats

There is quite a lot of history there.

Hi All,

 

I'm planning to build a small pedal powered catamaran, so I will need a
right angle gearbox.  I have seen this one on the net:

 

http://www.mitrpak.com/product_datasheet.php?product_id=34   

 

which would serve my needs very well, but it is a bit pricey, though I would
pay it if I had to.  My question is where else might I find 90 degree
gearboxes on-line.  

 

I will also need a universal joint for a small shaft, maybe 5/8" or 3/4".
Do any of you know of an on-line supplier for these, stainless steel
preferred.

 

Thanks,

Ken

Those who can count, and those who can't.

The Mitrpak gearbox is an excellent one. The spiral bevel gears provide
very smooth action and the gearbox seals on the stainless shafts protect
the innards quite well in wet environments.

The Cadence uses the next size down, but with a small propeller and a
high shaft rpm it all works out.

Depending on your shaft misalignment and shaft support, you might consider
Love-Joy couplers instead of U-joints. Why do you need such a large shaft
diameter?

Michael Lampi

Thanks Michael,

Maybe I don't need such a large shaft.  I'm new to this which is why I bring
it up here.  Also, these boats won't be racers by any means.  Just pleasure
craft, though any efficiency is always desirable.

I will need to able to raise the prop maybe 15 degrees to be able to protect
it in shallow water. Will the Love-Joy couplings have that much flex?

I'm unsure what you mean by the Cadence.  Is this another gearbox from
Mitrpak or is it a boat.  I think what you are saying is that Mitrpak makes
a smaller gear box that is on the Cadence which is a boat, maybe your boat.
I see a smaller gearbox at Mitrpak with a 3/8ths shaft.  Is this what you
mean?  Also,  if the Cadence is a boat would you have a link to it?

Thanks for your time,
Ken

Ken
I expect the 0.5" shaft is the best.  You can use it with a 4:1  
ratio, which is reasonably easy to achieve with standard bike bits.

If you go on Ebay you can sometimes find low cost boxes that are  
quite good.  The Mitrpak is hard to beat though.

The universal joint will give you a jerky sensation on the pedals.   
One that will handle the torque will be quite large and contribute  
noticeable drag.  I have used one at higher rpm and it was OK.

The best set up I have found is a side mounted curved shaft.  I  
prefer a 8mm (5/16") spring steel for the shaft.  I paint them to  
reduce corrosion.  The best set up I have used is shown here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_Dec_2008.jpg
The latest arrangement has carbon fibre tubing for the frame.

You can see the curved shaft running down the side of the hull.  The  
shaft strut has 2 small stainless steel bearings purchased from  
"smallparts".  It is very smooth in operation.

The shaft can be pulled up while on the water for inspection for weed  
or running in shallow water because it is flexible.  The strut is set  
up to stop the prop from hitting the hull but it is pivoted at the  
top, allowing it to swing outward freely.

Finding spring steel in the form of straight round bar is not that  
easy but it is worth the effort.  It can be cut with a hacksaw but  
the blade will need to be replaced afterwards.  I use a grinder.  You  
can use 1/4" round bar but it will feel jerky at high power level.

This is a link to a photo of the Cadence type boat that Mike referred  
to:

Thanks for the links Rick.  The flex shaft is fascinating.  Not sure were
I'd find some spring steel shaft, but I'll look around.   

In the mean while I did figure out how else I could do this, and that is to
put the angle gearbox after, below, or on the swivel that the top end of the
drive shaft mounted to.  But this would point the propeller at a little bit
of a downward angle.  Not sure what that would do to the efficiency of the
prop.

I expect the 0.5" shaft is the best.  You can use it with a 4:1  
ratio, which is reasonably easy to achieve with standard bike bits.

If you go on Ebay you can sometimes find low cost boxes that are  
quite good.  The Mitrpak is hard to beat though.

The universal joint will give you a jerky sensation on the pedals.   
One that will handle the torque will be quite large and contribute  
noticeable drag.  I have used one at higher rpm and it was OK.

The best set up I have found is a side mounted curved shaft.  I  
prefer a 8mm (5/16") spring steel for the shaft.  I paint them to  
reduce corrosion.  The best set up I have used is shown here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_Dec_2008.jpg
The latest arrangement has carbon fibre tubing for the frame.

You can see the curved shaft running down the side of the hull.  The  
shaft strut has 2 small stainless steel bearings purchased from  
"smallparts".  It is very smooth in operation.

The shaft can be pulled up while on the water for inspection for weed  
or running in shallow water because it is flexible.  The strut is set  
up to stop the prop from hitting the hull but it is pivoted at the  
top, allowing it to swing outward freely.

Finding spring steel in the form of straight round bar is not that  
easy but it is worth the effort.  It can be cut with a hacksaw but  
the blade will need to be replaced afterwards.  I use a grinder.  You  
can use 1/4" round bar but it will feel jerky at high power level.

This is a link to a photo of the Cadence type boat that Mike referred  
to:

Thanks Michael,

Maybe I don't need such a large shaft.  I'm new to this which is why  
I bring
it up here.  Also, these boats won't be racers by any means.  Just  
pleasure
craft, though any efficiency is always desirable.

I will need to able to raise the prop maybe 15 degrees to be able to  
protect
it in shallow water. Will the Love-Joy couplings have that much flex?

I'm unsure what you mean by the Cadence.  Is this another gearbox from
Mitrpak or is it a boat.  I think what you are saying is that Mitrpak  
makes
a smaller gear box that is on the Cadence which is a boat, maybe your  
boat.
I see a smaller gearbox at Mitrpak with a 3/8ths shaft.  Is this what  
you
mean?  Also,  if the Cadence is a boat would you have a link to it?

Thanks for your time,
Ken

The efficiency of the propeller correlates with the aspect of the  
blades.  Long thin blades will be more efficient than short fat  
ones.  Inevitably there is a compromise based on draft or blade  
strength.

Mounting an efficient propeller at a slight angle will reduce  
efficiency by a small amount.  However the blade loading becomes very  
unballanced.  At a shaft angle around 5 degrees the the downgoing  
blade will be thrusting with high force while the upgoing blade will  
be doing next to nothing.  This condition puts the shaft in high  
bending load and creates vibration.  Increasing the shaft angle  
beyond 5 degrees really starts to cause problems.

You will see powered propeller shafts at higher angles like 15  
degrees but these props have high slip and usually three or more  
blades so the vibration is not as bad.  They usually have efficiency  
between 50 to 60%.

If you have a propeller pushing on a shaft the shaft can be  
completely unsupported as the prop is strongly self stabilising.   
When the shaft is inclined you are fighting these forces.

It is worth the effort to get spring steel if you can.  Machinable  
grade aluminium also works but it needs to be about 10mm thick and a  
little longer as it cannot be curved as tight.

Thanks Again Rick, I will move on to propellers in a new thread soon.  For
now, I haven't been able to lay my hands on any 5/16ths spring steel, 1/4"
is all I could find, but the supplier had some "stressproof" steel that they
say is .40/.48 carbon, which I assume is a percentage.  Anyway it has pretty
good spring to it, and was cheap so I bought some that I will test later
today.

More later,
Ken

I have the book "Fluid-Dynamic Drag" by S. F. Hoerner that has a ton of
interesting information in it.  One of the charts shows induced drag for
trapezoidal wings with different ratios of root to tip cord.  I used this to
look at minimizing induced drag for a given amount of sail area and
overturning moment for a sail boat.  As I recall, for a given aspect ratio,
minimum induced drag comes with the tip cord at 1/3 of the base cord.
However, on a sailboat you are limited by stability, so induced drag vs
overturning moment is important, not induced drag vs aspect ratio.

What I found was that by increasing the sail cord at the base and reducing
it at the tip I could increase the aspect ratio of the sail and for the same
overturning moment the net induced drag dropped.

I would expect some similar effect for propellers, although significantly
more complicated.  In a propeller the aspect ratio is limited by material
properties.  If you increase the taper of the propeller the base of the
blade gets wider and thicker and so stronger and stiffer.  This might not be
the most efficient shape for a given aspect ratio, but it might let you run
significantly higher aspect ratio and I would expect the higher aspect ratio
to give a net benefit.

Unfortunately, you could make it more complicated still by including the
thickness ratio in the optimization.  For a given propeller design there is
an optimum thickness ratio, but using one thicker than optimum would give
more strength and stiffness and support a higher aspect ratio.  Even load
distribution could be optimized this way.  Increasing the loading at the
roots reduces the stress on the blade and allows a higher aspect ratio.

I wouldn't want to try to write the code to optimize all of the variables,
but it does seem some improvement could be made by changes that would
improve the  mechanical/strength efficiency of the design.

Good to see your adaptations to the flex shaft have worked so well in =
your hpb, Rick. I particularly like your side mount and ability to =
quickly clear weeds. Wonder if there are considerations because the =
thrust being parallel rather than in line with the hull....=20
=20
In my much lower power electric applications I use a much shorter 4' =
shaft made of fiberglass tube graduated in two sections. No strut or =
rudder. This seems to give better pivoting steering control from the =
stiffer upper section while allowing just enough flexing from the lower =
section to allow the prop to go where it wants. I need the lowest weight =
possible in my application so am always looking for the the lightest =
shaft and prop possible. That way the whole unit can be lifted up to =
remove weeds or even hand held for propulsion in extremely shallow =
water. I have quick release hex connectors for the shaft and quick =
release adaptations on the prop so that both can be switched out in =
seconds. That way data can be quickly gathered for different motor and =
prop combinations. Should the shaft or prop be damaged or lost on an =
excursion, switching to spare ones carried on board only takes seconds.
=20
Hope this is useful to anyone working with flex shafts.

Cheers.

Ken
The efficiency of the propeller correlates with the aspect of the=20
blades.  Long thin blades will be more efficient than short fat=20
ones.  Inevitably there is a compromise based on draft or blade=20
strength.

Mounting an efficient propeller at a slight angle will reduce=20
efficiency by a small amount.  However the blade loading becomes very=20
unballanced.  At a shaft angle around 5 degrees the the downgoing=20
blade will be thrusting with high force while the upgoing blade will=20
be doing next to nothing.  This condition puts the shaft in high=20
bending load and creates vibration.  Increasing the shaft angle=20
beyond 5 degrees really starts to cause problems.

You will see powered propeller shafts at higher angles like 15=20
degrees but these props have high slip and usually three or more=20
blades so the vibration is not as bad.  They usually have efficiency=20
between 50 to 60%.

If you have a propeller pushing on a shaft the shaft can be=20
completely unsupported as the prop is strongly self stabilising. =20
When the shaft is inclined you are fighting these forces.

It is worth the effort to get spring steel if you can.  Machinable=20
grade aluminium also works but it needs to be about 10mm thick and a=20
little longer as it cannot be curved as tight.

Thanks for the links Rick.  The flex shaft is fascinating.  Not sure=20
were
I'd find some spring steel shaft, but I'll look around.

In the mean while I did figure out how else I could do this, and that=20
is to
put the angle gearbox after, below, or on the swivel that the top end=20
of the
drive shaft mounted to.  But this would point the propeller at a=20
little bit
of a downward angle.  Not sure what that would do to the efficiency=20
of the
prop.

Greetings All,

 

It's time for me to do a little research on propellers and such.  I was
looking at Rich W's. boat here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_Dec_2008.jpg   and I noticed a
wide and steeply pitched prop.  I'm sure that this is a very efficient
setup, so are there plans/drawings for this prop?  How wide is it, and at
what pitch?  Are there props for sale?  If I have to make my own, what
materials would I use, wood, fiberglass, or...?

 

On a related thread what rpms do these generally run at, and what cadence is
typical for the pedaling?  

 

Thanks a lot,

Ken

Ken
I have been travelling.  I did email directly but not sure if you got  
it.

The best prop is designed to suit the application.  You need to know  
what power you can produce and what speed you will achieve with that  
power. If you have a hull in mind then the speed v power can be  
worked out.  The best way to determine your power output is to do a  
test on a recumbent machine at a gym.

Typical value of cadence is 70rpm and prop speed is 300rpm.  The  
300rpm works well for a suitable prop.

JavaProp is quite good for designing a prop.  You need to set the  
Options to suit water and select a suitable foil.  You need to select  
a foil.  The E193 at Re# 100,000 and 1 degree AoA is OK.   The design  
process is iterative.  You need to achieve adequate strength while  
aiming for the highest efficiency.

If you can weld then the easiest way to make a nice prop is to use  
stainless steel flat bar.  I have a procedure for this.

The Bolly boat prop is OK for an easily driven hull.  Will not be as  
good as you can make to suit but still good for most applications.

Rick

Hey, Boaters
 
 
There will be a fun ride on Sunday Meet in front of Bulldog Saloon Elkhart  
In. Be there by 9:00 AM 26 July. If you want to do times let me know ASAP.  
Choices include 100 meter trap, and a 3-4 mile (depending on speed of  
current) trial, or a possible run up wilder waters towards Bristol, or  others.
 
Hope you're having a happy healthy Summer,
 
 
jake

I finally got around to making a folding prop that was suggested  
earlier in the year.  I tested it on Saturday.  Seems to perform as  
well as my best rigid prop.  It is nice to be able to stop pedalling  
and coast.  If I sense weed on the prop then coasting allows the weed  
to flow off the blades.

A small amount of weed collected on the strut but this can be easily  
reached to remove.  Most weed is channelled down the shaft to the  
prop.  Being able to clear it by coasting is far more effective then  
untangling it by hand while stopped.

I have placed a photos showing the folded and unfolded positions.  If  
only one blade folds it will go almost in line with the shaft.  When  
both fold they stop against each other in the position in the photo.

Hi Rick

Great prop.

I thought that you did not use a strut but let the shaft flex and find its 
own position.

On the hinge pins are these riveted in or do you use a form of socket cap 
screw.

Do you think the slots for the blade to fold  generate any drag.

Hi Rick


Great prop.

I thought that you did not use a strut but let the shaft flex and  
find its
own position.

On the hinge pins are these riveted in or do you use a form of socket  
cap
screw.

Do you think the slots for the blade to fold  generate any drag.

Dennis
I have used props strutless but it is not practical for everyday  
use.  The prop hangs when the boat is carried.  The prop will  
sometimes hit the hull in a turn if there are waves.  The prop dives  
when you go in reverse.  I use a light tension strut that can be  
folded sideways to inspect the prop or to enable the boat to be set  
evenly on the beach.  Is costs about 2W.


I used a 6mm partially threaded bolt for the prop pivot.  The hole on  
one side of the blade is threaded and the other is a neat 6mm.  I  
bolted the blades firmly in place with bolt thread and head both  
exposed. I then cut these exposed bits and filed them flush with the  
curve of the hub.  It will not be easy to remove the blades.  I would  
need to mill or drill out the bolts first.

The slot behind the blades will offer no measurable drag.

I continue to be impressed with the prop.  I am still to get some  
calm weather for best comparison but comparing with data from the  
last couple years it seems my average speed is a little higher.   
There are three things that are contributing.  The boat is lighter  
and optmised for 11kph rather than 12kph so less wetted surface.  I  
do not need to stop forward progress to clean the prop of weed and am  
able to do this as soon as I suspect extra drag.  I am currently  
running a higher gear ratio, which improves biomechanical efficiency  
however is tough on the legs on windy days.  Not sure if I will stay  
with this ratio.

I did 25km on Saturday with wind to 50kph at an average of 9.0kph.  
The previous best in these heavy conditions over that distance was  
8.7kph.  I expect to get up to average of 10.5kph in calm weather.   
Time will tell.

The one weakness with the prop is reverse thrust.  I need to spin  
quite fast to go astern.  Quite different to a fixed bladed prop.

I noticed my previous link to the prop photo was missing a bit.  Here  
is the full link:

Sorry to react so late to Rick's propeller advices.
For my aquatic vehicles I tested the props sold through Hobbycity, the master
airscrew 15x10 and the 18x12. 12 being the maximal pitch they sell. Obviously
they lack pitch if you keep the same gear.

As I definitely needed more pitch I wanted to try the 15x25 Bolly, but it seems
that Bolly have stopped somme of its works. The 15x25 prop is only sold by 30
pieces.
I am still looking for one, if one of you get one and could kindly sell it to
me, I would be the happiest.

 I have been travelling.  I did email directly but not sure if you got
 it.

 The best prop is designed to suit the application.  You need to know
 what power you can produce and what speed you will achieve with that
 power. If you have a hull in mind then the speed v power can be
 worked out.  The best way to determine your power output is to do a
 test on a recumbent machine at a gym.

 Typical value of cadence is 70rpm and prop speed is 300rpm.  The
 300rpm works well for a suitable prop.

 JavaProp is quite good for designing a prop.  You need to set the
 Options to suit water and select a suitable foil.  You need to select
 a foil.  The E193 at Re# 100,000 and 1 degree AoA is OK.   The design
 process is iterative.  You need to achieve adequate strength while
 aiming for the highest efficiency.

 If you can weld then the easiest way to make a nice prop is to use
 stainless steel flat bar.  I have a procedure for this.

 The Bolly boat prop is OK for an easily driven hull.  Will not be as
 good as you can make to suit but still good for most applications.

 Rick


 Greetings All,

 It's time for me to do a little research on propellers and such.  I was
 looking at Rich W's. boat here:
 http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V11J_Dec_2008.jpg   and I
 noticed a
 wide and steeply pitched prop.  I'm sure that this is a very efficient
 setup, so are there plans/drawings for this prop?  How wide is it,
 and at
 what pitch?  Are there props for sale?  If I have to make my own, what
 materials would I use, wood, fiberglass, or...?

 On a related thread what rpms do these generally run at, and what
 cadence is
 typical for the pedaling?

 Thanks a lot,

 Ken

For such a high drag application the Bolly prop would not have enough  
blade area to be efficient.

The low pitch props you have will give you better efficiency than a  
Bolly but of course you need to gear it up.

A higher pitch like the Bolly would need 4 or more blades get good  
efficiency.   These Bolly props are made for easily driven hulls that  
have much lower drag than the Velosub.

If you cannot alter the gearing then you will be better off making  
your own prop as it is a unique application.

The APC 16x16 prop is great.
I have used it for a long time on my inflatable pontoon pedal boat.
My drive system has a gear ratio of 5,5 to 1.

Hello Rick,
thanks for your excellent report on the 404km Murray Marathon.
Wow - you and your HPB performed just great!
You must have been excited on the first day - according to both heart =
beat
and speed :-)=20
Your folding prop is a big success, too! I agree that you should get rid =
of
the weed collecting strut.
Seems like your amas touch the surface constantly. With an extremely =
narrow
width of 225mm you have to ensure stability in one or the other way. I =
would
be interested in how much drag your amas produce at the present setting.

Best greetings
Clem

Clem re
Seems like your amas touch the surface constantly. With an extremely  
narrow
width of 225mm you have to ensure stability in one or the other way.  
I would
be interested in how much drag your amas produce at the present setting.

At the start of each day I have about 5kg of water and food on board  
and the stabilisers are on the surface.  As the day wears on the  
water is reduced and I lose body weight.  I end up about 7kg lighter  
at the end of the day and the stabilisers are well clear of the water  
if there are no waves.

I can balance the boat by moving my weight and keep both stabilisers  
above the water.  If they touch it is momentary.  I tend to operate  
these by the sound.  You can hear them clipping the water and if one  
is doing it more than the other I move a little.  In a strong side  
wind I move my back across the seat by 100mm or more.

If there is small chop the stabilisers just clip the tops of the  
waves.  In this condition the boat tends to ride flat without have to  
balance with my body.

Anyhow my aim is to keep the stabilisers off the water and the most  
significant drag from them is windage.

Rick Willoughby

How do you change direxction of the pedal motion right angle(s) to accommod=
ate a propeller?
If you use some sort of right angle gearing where did you find it or did yo=
u make it?
If the use of a propeller is to complicated what other means are commonly u=
sed among this HPV-boats group?
I would like to find a small right angle drive that I can put in the water =
and a second that I can somehow connect to the one driving the propeller an=
d drive with a chain=A0 connected to pedals so that I could better vary the=
 gear ratio between the pedals and the propeller.

If varying=A0 the gear ratio does not seem that important then at least I w=
ant to really up the RPM's of the propeller at least into the many hundreds=
 of rpm's while keeping my cadence under 80 rpm. My legs feel like limp noo=
dles if I try to keep a cadence over 80 rpm for long but I can easily do 60=
 to 80 all day long day after day hours on end.
Also I hope to use this on the river so there is the up stream against the =
current and downstream with the current aspects of a pedal boat.

There are a few manufacturers of angle drives.  Mitrpak are possibly  
the best value.
http://www.mitrpak.com/product_datasheet.php?product_id=34

The best size prop will be spun at 4 to 5 times cadence.  You can use  
a large diameter prop turned at 2 to 3 time cadence directly from a  
gearbox but the box costs quite a lot.

You can also use twisted chain drives.

You can pair two boxes with 1:2 steep up to get combined 1:4 but this  
ends up very expensive.

There is a thread on this forum that has a huge amount of detail with  
photos if you care to wade through it:

New Gear Assembly for Human and Electric Powered Boats
Available for Prototype Testing


Troy, Michigan, April 12, 2010 ---  Marco Polo Boats, Inc. (MPB) of =20
Troy, Michigan, USA, seeks boat builders and human powered boating =20
enthusiasts to test prototypes of a new in-water gear assembly =20
designed for human powered and electric powered boats.

The prototype will be available this summer in four increaser ratios =20
and two torque specifications. The range is intended to serve the =20
leisure, rental, and performance markets.

Qualified testers will be loaned a prototype in exchange for =20
undertaking testing protocols over a 60 day period this summer. If a =20
tester completes the protocol and adheres to program requirements, he =20=

or she will be given a gear assembly when production commences.

=93Marco Polo Boats is excited about this mechanism and its potential =20=

for inexpensive and energy efficient small boat propulsion,=94 said Mark =
=20
Vermilion, president of MPB. =93We want it tested in the real world by =20=

human powered and electric boat enthusiasts so that we can make =20
improvements prior to production.=94

Qualified testers must provide their own water craft with front-end =20
pedaling or electric motor, a connecting shaft, and propeller. Optimum =20=

input RPMs for the unit are from 50 to 100.

The gear assembly comes in increaser ratios of 1:7 and 1:49 (each with =20=

a maximum torque of 157 lb-in), and 1:5 and 1:25 (each with a maximum =20=

torque of 200 lb-in).

MPB seeks testing applicants according to the following chart:

Human Powered Category
Ratio				Number of Units	Max. Torque
1:5				4			200 lb.-in.
1:7				4			157 lb.-in.
1:25				2			200 lb.-in
1:49				2			157 lb.-in.

Electric Motor Powered
Ratio				Number of Units
1:5				2			200 lb.-in
1:7				2			157 lb.-in.

Interested parties should e-mail testprogram@marcopoloboats.com for =20
program requirements.

 hour.
I am the kayaking coach of the best Australian Team, I am fit and would like=
 to get rid of my motorboat for something quieter with no pollution when I a=
m coaching my squad of 25 -19 of them Australian National representatives..
If it works for me, I am sure there would be many more interested coaches to=
 swap too.
Here in sunny Queensland/ Australia, there are lots of waterways and I have=
 not seen any of your products yet, which is strange- there are some in my b=
irthplace Hungary, they even have a Water Bike Club there.
I am sure it would be very popular here in a short time if some were availab=

Hi Peter
             A speed of 20kph for any sort of human powered boat
would be only possible for an elite athlete in a sprint.
Have a look at the boat design forum 
http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/boat-design/pedal-powered-boats-23345.html
this is the link for pedal powered boats and will give you a good
idea of what is out there. In Australia pedal boats are like hens
teeth, the commercial ones available are no where near the speed
you mentioned.

I went out in some blustery conditions today to test my latest boat.

It is version 15 or V15_5m.  I have a few refinements but I think  
this will be the basis for more boats if I make any more for own use  
or for others.  This one has been designed and built to suit my  
sister who is lighter than me.  It still performs well with more weight.

I ordered a purpose made gearbox from Mitrpak for this boat.    
Marcopolo boats have decided to stock some of these modified boxes so  
they are more readily available.

Wind was up to 70kph so not the ideal day for first outing.  I was  
pleased with how it went.  I want to make a few adjustments but the  
changes have all worked as intended.  The wave-piercing bow works  
very well in waves.  There seems to be no tendency to bury into the  
back of waves when running that I have experienced with the earlier  
hulls.

I have created a web page for this new boat here:

A few questions if you dont mind.
What is the weight of the boat?  I have not weighed it in final  
form.  The bits totaled just under 20kg. When not on it it needed to  
be pointed into the wind to prevent it getting blown away.
What does the gear box look like up close?  There is an image here:
http://marcopoloboats.com/MitrpakDrive.html
Although it shows the standard box; not the one with the square taper  
to suit cranks.
What CAD program did you use to do the 3D modeling?  Delftship Pro.   
You can get a reasonable free version of with no strings attached.   
It has slightly less functionality than the Pro version.
What weight driver is the boat optimized for? The boat is optimised  
for a 60kg person but will also perform well with a heavier person at  
high power.It only takes 300W to do 15kph with a 70kg rider.  That is  
about the limit of the little gearbox.  You need a larger box if you  
want to use more power.
Can you show how low in the water the boat is when the driver is  
mounted? This image shows the waterline with total of 90kg:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_5m_Linesplan.png
Is there any lift or rise out of the water at all while underway?   
The boat starts bow up at about 7kph with net sinkage up to 13kph and  
then begins to lift.  It is not planing but the wave pressure causes  
it to lift.
It looks very nice. Thank you - I hope my sister likes it!! I am  
thinking about modifying V14 to use some of these new ideas.

Thanks

Rick

Hull speed is a defined parameter based on boat length and the  
gravity constant.  It does not have any significance for any slender  
hull as there is no measurable wave hump.  The drag goes up in  
proportion to the square of the speed.

The wave piercing requirement only applies to ambient waves; not  
anything to do with waves produced by the hull.  The aim is to pass  
through the ambient waves rather than being slowed down by them.   
This is not difficult with slender hulls but they have a tendency to  
dive into the back of waves when going downwind.  My new deckline  
with the "V" shape at the bow parts the waves neatly and does not get  
forced down once underwater.

Since the hull is wave piercing instead of the other kind,does it  
still experience the maximum speeds limited to hull length like sail  
boats ?

Thanks for the report and link, Rick. Cool looking and wave functional 
creation you came up with! Good strut reinforcement for rough water, yet 
seems to keep folding capability. Suspect you might be sending your sister 
to set records at sea :-)  ?
I see you went with a flex shaft and folding prop on this model as well. It 
appears that the shaft runs free inside the shell, but with a skeg/bearing 
only at the prop location. If so, that is something new as well.

On anothe note, wonder if you ever got the time to test out the idea of a 
carbon fiber sleeve reinforcement on your flex shaft? 
http://www.cstsales.com/carbon_braid.html  I haven't had free time to 
explore this yet.

Regards,

Vic

Vic
I tried the 6mm sleeve I had on a 1/4" spring steel shaft.  I was  
disappointed because it did not make measurable increase in the  
torsional rigidity.  It is an effective way to protect the shaft.   
When I tested it the epoxy was only a couple of days old so not fully  
cured.  I will do a more precise side-by-side comparison with  
unsleeved rod at some point.

As Mark Drela commented it would have been smarter to use thicker  
tube.  It is much easier to reduce the diameter of the tube by  
pulling it tight than it is to increase the diameter when it is  
loose.  The fibes in the sleeve are running more like 20 to 30  
degrees than 45.

The new shaft is a combination 12mm aluminium rod through a HDPE pipe  
in the hull and 8mm spring steel beyond the tube.  The steel portion  
slots into the aluminium.  That connection is epoxy glued and I have  
wrapped a few layers of glass tape over the joint.  I made a small  
sleeve from UHMWPE for the bearing at the bottom of the shaft tube.   
The tube exits just behind the gearbox so it does not need to be sealed.

The folding prop sheds most weed so I do not need access to it.  It  
is possible to get a bit of weed wrapped around the hub but that will  
usually dislodge by reversing.  Most floating weed gets pushed aside  
by the hull.

Having the prop right out the stern reduced the tendency to ventilate  
in waves.  This improves as I go faster because the boat sits bow up  
a little and the prop goes deeper.  In the 1 to 2 ft waves yesterday  
the prop only ventilated a couple of times.  The side mounted prop  
would have ventilated more often in waves like that.

Rick

On anothe note, wonder if you ever got the time to test out the idea  
of a
carbon fiber sleeve reinforcement on your flex shaft?

       Saw the pics and video of V15 looks great. The
trailer would make transport easy and there would be
no setting up. Does the boat have a skeg or is the
shaft unsupported? Is there a reason for the outrigger
fixing points being towards the front and not in the
middle?
       When will you be at Lysterfield lake next? Give
me a date and time and I'll see you there. Would be
great to see the boat on the water.
       Can the involute gearbox be fitted to the V15 design?

I have a flexible strut to prevent the shaft from hanging down too  
far - just a simple UHMWPE bush.  It also allows an effective reverse.

I wanted to get the outriggers as far back as I could while having  
the bracing off the wider and higher part of the hull.  Having the  
outriggers near the stern avoids flop roll when running with waves.

I am not sure if I like the folding system.  It puts the front of the  
outriggers near the balance point so makes it more awkward to carry  
than it should be when they are folded in.  It is quick and easy to  
launch but it should be easier to carry given the light weight.  I  
might spread them on the trailer next time.

I will probably convert V14 hull to something similar to V15 and I  
will just use the slide-in tubes for the outriggers rather than the  
folding.

I expect I will be there next weekend but I would like better weather  
to do proper set up.  I will let you know through the week.  I can  
easily  transport two boats now.

I think the involute would fit as it is.  It depends on the leg  
length because the shaft inclines at a slightly higher angle than  
torque box it mounts off.  So the clearance increases as the box is  
moved forward.  A racing version of this boat could have the heavier  
box.  A strong rider should be able to get it 20kph as this requires  
less power than to get V11 or V14 to that speed.  However you would  
not want to try that with the little gearbox.

I have a couple of changes to the design that would make it easier to  
build.  It would not be difficult to adjust the angle of the torque  
box to suit a higher gearbox.  Mine might be a bit too wide for the  
involute box as well.

So far the hull seems to work extremely well in waves.  My rudders  
are a work in progress.  I am using nylon gears rather than pull  
cords and it has some problems at the moment so turning is not where  
I want it yet.

Right now my gearbox is a bit too close for me.  I will leave it like  
that so it might be just about right for you and Ian Knox who wants  
to have a go.

Wow
Rick, you really are a genius!
This boat is perfect - the result of an evolutionary process.
The folding prop, the free floating shaft, the hull configuration, the
ultralight materials, the sleek pelican design: Your sister will be proud of
her custom made human powered speed boat.
Congratulations!

Best greetings 
Clemens

Was this shaft you constructed covered with only a single layer of carbon 
fiber mesh tube?
What kind of epoxy did you use, and did you use the heat shrink tubing 
method to tighten up to the shaft?

Could that angle strength be improved somehow, say by using multiple layers

direction?

Thanks,

Vic
It was only a single layer.  The epoxy was Solid Bond 330.  This is  
the TDS:
http://www.solidsolutions.com.au/datasheets/tds_er_epoxy_bond_430.pdf
The bond did not break but it would not have reached fully cured  
state when I tested.

The fibres were tight to the steel because I hung the shaft from the  
tube to stretched it while it cured.

I had intended to use up to 3 layers but the tubing I purchased was  
too small to allow that.

There is no doubt that building up the number of layers would add  
stiffness.  The idea is fine but my initial execution was poor.  I  
would recommend it if you want a torsionally stiff lightweight shaft  
that will bend.  You could build it up on any round section material  
as a former.  It should be a complete seal so electrolysis will not  
be an issue.  The connections would also be epoxy glued.

Hi Clem
Still plenty of room for improvement yet.

I can simplify the building a bit.  I will also alter the back. It  
does not need to be as long to get the aerodynamic benefit and is a  
pain to construct the tortured curve.

The rudders need some work.  I am not sure how much at this stage.   
During the test I ended up with only one rudder working because the  
other worked loose so have to fix that.

I have a slightly lower drag design dubbed V15_6m that I am playing  
with.  The aim with it is to get something with the best high speed  
performance having 100kg displacement.  Something that a good athlete  
could better Olympic single scull times over 2000m.  It is optimised  
for 18kph.  The seat back is more inclined similar to the inclination  
I have on the V14 seat now.

Rick

Wow
Rick, you really are a genius!
This boat is perfect - the result of an evolutionary process.
The folding prop, the free floating shaft, the hull configuration, the
ultralight materials, the sleek pelican design: Your sister will be  
proud of
her custom made human powered speed boat.
Congratulations!

Best greetings
Clemens

Rick, if you can suffer one more pesky question? This can be answered with a 
yes or no.

Do you think there would be enough LONGITUDINAL stiffness in a tube formed 
from layers of the expoxied mesh alone, to mimic the round section 
behaviour, IF you dissolve out the round section?

Hope this makes sense, as I as my goal is to get the lightest, thinnest, 
strongest, flex shaft possible.

Essentially yes but suggest leave the former there.

If I was going for really light I would go for aluminium tube as the  
former.  6mm tube is very light and you can hang during curing to  
ensure it is straight.

Wooden dowel would also be OK.

You probably want a minimum of three layers of the weight I used to  
get suitable strength - CF303.  I would go for 25+feet of the 1/2"  
CF9313 if I was doing it again.  With the aim of minimum of 3  
layers.   Anything less and it will be too fragile to connect to and  
handle.

Providing you get it thick enough it has the fibres ideally oriented  
for torsional rigidity while having bending compliance.  Without the  
firmer core it would be more prone to buckling failure so I would  
leave the former inside.

I will compare torsional rigidity today with unsheethed rod using  
same torque.

The sleeved shaft is 24% stiffer while being 6% heavier.

I may have got a bit better if I had been able to get the fibres at  
45 degrees rather than something less.

The resin ratio is about 1.5x so more than you would use with  
multiple layers.  I was aiming for the resin to provide extra  
protection for the CF.

Remember the stiffness is a function of the 4th power of diameter so  
the improvement is not linear.  Another layer would probably get to  
60% better and three layers would be equivalent to the steel alone.

Aluminium is 1/3rd the stiffness of steel so one layer of the CF will  
almost double what you get from aluminium rod.

No-Worries:: the gearboxes suitable for adapting to "Human-Power" are 
plentiful. cheap [free], rugged, but not marinised. 
Angle-grinders provide them, burnt motors with smoothly run-in gears ; I've 
gutted about 20 of them, they are usually 3 to 4 to one, common makita is 
3.3,which I find optimum. The highest ratio I've found is a 9::1, but that 
was 'stripped'
The'trick' is to make an adaptor for fitting a cluster [I use 14-18 tooth] 
onto the shaft where the disc was [maybe remove the ratchet mechanism] ; 
struggle & fight to remove the rotor windings; cut this motor-shaft short & 
make a coupling [about 9mm id]
For a pp boat, have the chainwheel on the right side of a 'crankshaft; so the 
chain passes behind the operator to a cluster [enabling variable ratios]- a 
shaft across to the centre-line, where the g/b increases speed / changes 
direction / feeds aft to the prop-shaft. via a seal & universal-joint.
Use a bigger chainwheel for higher RPM output.
Ok so I made one  -almo0st - figured a better solution - I'll tell you when I 
have it!

go!

Seeing your V15 design has put me on a new design tangent. I have been =
slowly making a new proa, one that is lighter and narrower. I have only =
made the hull so far and have not decked it in as I keep changing my =
mind. The hull is 5m long and 200mm beam with a depth of 250mm, basic =
box section with a small rocker on the bottom.=20

My main design criteria is to use the involute gearbox and the boat can =
be setup sitting flat on the beach. With the V15 being able to sit flat =
and the shaft raised and lowered it is a much simpler way to go. The =
proa works well but needs heavier beams and needs more setting up, a =
stabilized monohull has smaller lighter beams and a lot less setting up. =
The proa is always pushing two hulls through the water, even though the =
outrigger is long and narrow it is still drag in the water.=20

I would not have the involute gearbox permanently fitted but bolt it in =
and out each time as it's a heavy hunk of metal. The dipping rudders I =
will give a try as its less drag and lets the boat sit flat on the =
beach, also they don't get in the way of the shaft.

The narrow hull allows for the gearbox to be 200mm above the deck =
instead of 300mm as the pedals are over the side of the boat.=20

After all that I am looking at a boat like V14 but with the shaft =
through the hull and bolt on outriggers.

The new boat does not sit quite flat on the bean but the shaft is  
strong enough to allow it to sit on it.  It just springs out of the  
way.  You would not want to sit on on the beach as they may bend the  
shaft.

With your higher ratio you can use a smaller prop with shaft coming  
out even further aft.

I think if you make a seat and torque box like mine you could  
permanently mount the gearbox.  There is a lot of weight in bottom  
bracket, chain, chainring, sprocket and small box.  I doubt not much  
less than the Involute box.  It is just that the Involute box is a  
concentrated lump.  The most awkward part with V15 is the position of  
the outriggers when folded.

Thanks, Rick you have given me a lot to think about.  Those are quite 
impressive measurements.
How thin will the 1/4" mesh go when stretched tight on a rod, as I am 
shooting for about 1/8" on the rod part. That way I can add another layer 
for strength if needed. Can I get small amounts of the equivalent epoxy in 
USA, is my next question to research....

It could easily reduce to half nominal diameter.  The fibres will run  
a little straighter so will increase buckling resistance but not so  
much to torsional rigidity.

If you only wanted to go to around 1/4" overall you might get 3  
layers on something starting at 1/8".  I think you would have to wait  
for some initial cure before putting on each layer.  With epoxy you  
can accelerate the curing by heating.  The other way would be to  
place all layers dry and then really soak the shaft, working until  
wetted out.  The fibres tend to form tiny needles that catch on  
successive layers as they are slid on.  The more damage the more  
needles.

Hi All

I have a 22 ft kingfisher yacht http://www.kyoa.org.uk/k20+technical.htm  I
am interested in powering it partly through human power when I am on  inland
canals etc.

I will also have a conventional outboard for when I get tired!

I plan to make a Yuloh http://simplicityboats.com/yulohpage2.html which I
would hope to be able to use for about 2 hours a day. eg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7MQsdLpWaM

In addition seems to make sense to use your more powerful  leg muscles to
power the thing. I realize that the boat will not move fast, and that it
will be hard work.

The boat has an outboard well inside the boat and I am hoping to be able to
make use of that to install a pedal system.

1) Has anyone ever fitted a mirage drive to a boat this big? With what
results?

2) I am aware of the escargot
http://www.mission-base.com/pedal-power/pp_escargot_photos.html are there
any other large pedal powered boats out there?

3) I have had a browse on these archives, and have seen people making props
out of model aeroplane propellers, would the prop need to be longer for such
a heavy boat?

4) I am thinking of aiming for this kind of set up
http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system I
thought I might start with this cheap gearbox
http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=43541&C=Froogle&U=43541&T=Module
and
upgrade it later if the boat actually moves under pedal power.

Any comments or suggestions?

Thanks

Sam

Sam,

I do not know if what we have will work on such a large boat, but  
check out our PlanetDrive and MitrpakDrive on www.marcopoloboats.com.

The PlanetDrive is a gear increaser. Depending on the model, you can  
have increase ratios of 1:5, 1:7, 1:25, and 1:49. They are still in  
the prototype stage, but we could make one available to you if you are  
interested.

The MPB MitrpakDrive is a customized-for-pedaling Mitrpak right angle  
gear box at a 1:2 ratio, like the one Rick Willoughby has started to  
use. We will start selling these in a few weeks as soon as Mitrpak  
completes our order.

I am using a 12x12E model airplane prop (about $7) with the  
PlanetDrive and Mitrpak on a 12' catamaran, and it works great.

Also coming within three months is a flexible cable shaft, which may  
be useful to you if you need to snake a shaft around objects,


Thank  you,

Mark A. Vermilion

Sometimes, when becalmed, Mark and I would push his 35' Piver  
Trimaran liveaboard with one of the SpinFin equipped tenders.   
Without changing props, we wouldn't make two knots, but the effort  
was still comfortable.  Boats have the wonderful quality of only  
requiring hard work at higher RPMs, so if you want a workout, you  
have to keep pushing hard.
To maintain the same Froude efficiency at the prop, the swept area  
should be increased to compensate  for the decreased velocity, so  
that the same mass of water passes through the virtual prop disk.

Mark, are you using a carbon fiber 12x12E or fiberglass? What brand?
If the E stands for electric, the fiberglass ones, even with a thick hub 
have deflection and breakage issues for the APC brand at 50 watts in my 
gadgets.
Thanks,

Vic

By way of encouragement re. moving a large boat via human power -

I watched Larry Pardey scull "Taleisin", which was 29-feet 6-inches,  
with a 10-foot 9-inch beam, and 17,800 lbs. displacement, into a berth  
at Port Townsend, Washington, during one of the Wooden Boat Festivals .

Slow, but workable, and I didn't get the impression he was working  
exhaustively.

IIRC, he was using a long sweep over a stern quarter without foot  
power, but I could be mis-remembering that detail (foot/no foot).

Pretty impressive to see, ...but I wouldn't want to try it against any  
headwind.

Larry ( Interesting to see this new burst of activity on what seems to  
have become largely a ghost forum!)

Hi  all

Thanks for all the replies. I made my first yuloh today (the thing Larry was
using by the sound of it) I will post some photo's tomorrow in case any one
is interested.

http://www.simplicityboats.com/ScullYulohaboat.htm

I found it pretty effective, It's basically a large single bladed propeller.
I think I will put the leg pedalling on hold for a while whilst I get used
to the yuloh.

Thanks

Sam

Good.  That's the elegant solution, and if you can get yourself  
breathing as hard as you do on a bike, is hard to improve upon.

I've always thought Harry Bryan's fin  drive was interesting (aft of  
the stern, as opposed to the Hobie fin-drive amidships).

Harry used a forward skeg, I believe, on a boat designed to use the  
fin, to counteract yawing forces. I'm guessing that a larger/heavier   
boat would yaw less, and that for a given propulsive force, the fin  
drive wouldn't have any greater yaw component than a scull or yuloh  
(?). if not, this set-up would offer a leg-powered centerline   
motivator with trailing kick-up possibilities in the shallows. Also  
multi-operator linkages could allow shared and/or increased power to  
the fin. (are there multi-operator yulohs?)

i've not seen any mention of possible use of Harry's fin on larger  
craft.

Comments?

Vic,

Yes, it is the APC 12x12E that I am using. However, I am not a  
performance pedaler, so it works just fine.

Sam
In the event you get around to thinking about propeller systems  
again.  You may be interested in something I made for a large  
catamaran.  There is a particular yacht race here where human power  
is permitted as it is a combination of sailing and athletics (running  
up mountains) - called the The Three Peaks Race.

I mounted a gearbox with pedals over the stern of the catamaran using  
a curved shaft.  Picture here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Pecadillo_Pedal_Thruster.png
I initially tested it with an 800mm diameter large model plane prop  
and had buckling issues with the curved shaft due to the high thrust  
load and low rpm.  I then reduced the flexible portion of the shaft  
to about 1500mm and mounted this off a 1200mm length of aluminium  
tube.  For this shaft configuration I made a 4-bladed lightweight  
metal prop that was 600mm diameter.

In testing with the latter set up I got the 8 tonne catamaran to  
2.7kts working within my aerobic limit.  It was surprising how much  
difference having a dagger board partially lowered made to the drag  
due to the offline thrust.  This was in line with my prediction and  
translates to 4kts with two drives.

This year the pedal system was used in conjunction with oars.  The  
pedal system was as effective as two rowers while adding the pedal  
power to the rowers increased speed by about 50%.

The catamaran owner has since asked me to make a system using two  
gearboxes similar to this one:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/OW_Drive_Leg.jpg
This unit was made for a 400kg boat and has got that to 6kts - all  
day speed is around 4kts.  The unit for the catamaran will have a  
bigger prop and deeper leg.  It will be more compact for storage  
purposes than the long curved shaft.  If it tests out well then there  
will be one made for each hull.

I am able to do quite accurate performance predictions for these  
systems based on the hull shape, displacement and the drive system  
design.  For a small yacht you could get quite good results sitting  
across the cockpit with a drive leg below the hull and prop driven  
directly by a chain.  There are some very economical model plane  
props.  This one is similar to the big one I used initially:

Hi All

I have a 22 ft kingfisher yacht http://www.kyoa.org.uk/k20 
+technical.htm  I
am interested in powering it partly through human power when I am on   
inland
canals etc.

I will also have a conventional outboard for when I get tired!

I plan to make a Yuloh http://simplicityboats.com/yulohpage2.html  
which I
would hope to be able to use for about 2 hours a day. eg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7MQsdLpWaM

In addition seems to make sense to use your more powerful  leg  
muscles to
power the thing. I realize that the boat will not move fast, and that it
will be hard work.

The boat has an outboard well inside the boat and I am hoping to be  
able to
make use of that to install a pedal system.

1) Has anyone ever fitted a mirage drive to a boat this big? With what
results?

2) I am aware of the escargot
http://www.mission-base.com/pedal-power/pp_escargot_photos.html are  
there
any other large pedal powered boats out there?

3) I have had a browse on these archives, and have seen people making  
props
out of model aeroplane propellers, would the prop need to be longer  
for such
a heavy boat?

4) I am thinking of aiming for this kind of set up
http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive- 
system I
thought I might start with this cheap gearbox
http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx? 
ModuleNo=43541&C=Froogle&U=43541&T=Module
and
upgrade it later if the boat actually moves under pedal power.

Any comments or suggestions?

Thanks

Sam

Mark, I did find the APC electric props to be more efficient than the 
standard. They seem to have a wider section closer in, so that might be the 
reason. APC also makes a wide version of their standard prop in 12X10W which 
is quite robust and slightly more efficient than the standard 12X10, and 
there may be other "W" to explore depending on your gearing and what your 
goals are. I also found the wooden zinger 10X6XW (extra wide) to be at least 
if not better than the comparable APCs. They are also much lighter, even 
after a coating of epoxy to add strength and keep out moisture.

Hope this is of help.

Vic

Rick, lots of good info on material I don't know much about, Thanks! I did 
use a 0.18" pultruded CF shaft sometime ago until it tangled in a root and 
fractured. It was great, unlike anything else while it lasted, for my 
particular gadget. I am trying for even thinner and lighter using maybe one 
carbon mesh layer, since there is not a lot of torque demand in normal 
conditions. The lighter the lever arm in my application the better. I have 
also experimented with longish tapered spinners fore and aft of the prop, 
made from lightweight FLOATING material. Interesting advantages to these 
spinners when combined with a lightweight shaft and prop, as it introduces 
some upward forces that allow some degree of reverse, among other things....

Vic

Folks,

I am about ready to order customized flexible cable shafts rated to  
200 in-lbs of torque. They are  two meters long, and each end will  
have a 12 mm ID connector with an off center cotter pin hole. The  
cable is 316 stainless steel, and it allows you, within a certain  
radius, to bend the shaft as needed, i.e. a 90 degree angle, or around  
objects.  They are secured about every foot or two to your boat with  
simple clamps (not provided).

This may not be the performance market's ultimate shaft solution, but  
it does solve a lot of issues related to alignment, the raising of the  
prop in shallow water, and the breadth of boat designs in which it  
would work. For example, you could have a straight chain drive of a  
large increaser ratio, and connect the cable shaft, then bend it 90  
degrees to the stern. Or if you need to snake a shaft around other  
immovable boat parts, it may work for you.

I do not have final pricing yet, but I think they will be around $215,  
U.S. shipping included. That's not bad when compared to a stainless  
steel shaft and flexible shaft connectors, especially if you need to  
go the U-joint route.

I really do not know how well these will work in various applications,  
but I thought potential new uses was worth the risk. It will be fun to  
see what implementations the creative DIY hpb builder will come up  
with. If there is a market out there, we may be able to provide custom  
lengths in the future.

Thanks,

Mark A. Vermilion

Hi Guys,

My email box filled up near the end of the six months I was in India.  I was
so swamped teaching classes and
other chores that  I didn't get the mailbox cleaned out until today.

I am presently at a friend's sustainable farm 100 miles away from Houston,
Texas.  I am helping them out for
another week maybe ten days before heading east to South Florida.  After
visiting family and friends there,
 I will be heading back home to southern California.

I would love to meet other members of the group even if only for a chat over
a cup of coffee and pie.
I welcome invitations of hospitality.  I really would love to see some
homemade human powered vehicles

I love helping folks.  I am good at solving problems - computers, cars and
sometimes personal problems.
I am easy company and would love to hear your stories.  I have a few to tell
myself.

Huggs and my best wishes,
Bobby Ray

I am wondering if you still follow this list.

I am interested to know if you got your new boat going well.

Hi Rick
My new pedal boat "FAST 3" is now great at wave  hanging on the wake of 
passing river pleasure boats.
The following mods. have been undertaken;
1.     2 off ball bearing races fitted to prop strutt.
2.     New flat bottomed out riggers set to be just clear of the water have 
greatly improved the stability.
3.      Simple GPS fitted, but indicates very slow disappointing speed
4.    Prop calibrated, indicates 20% slipbased on pitch helix with no 
allowance for angle of attack
5    Peak speed momentery 12kph average 6.8 kph  I think that my cat is 
faster and will try the GPS on this.
6.    Rudder still to be sorted after many attemps.
7.     Folding prop is working well shedding weed, but failed after I hit a 
rock as it jammed with one blade shut.

Your sisters boat looks good, with a good turn of speed for a boat of that 
length.

Dennis

Dennis,

I have been unsuccessful getting any of my cats to do useful work in any context or contingency. 

What behavioral and design parameters have you introduced to get your cat to peddle your boat?

I think you are definitely on to something revolutionary.

Bruce

Dennis
I would have expected better than 6.8kph average.  8kph should be  
easy and 9kph possible for that length.  The slip is very high  
indicating the drag must be still quite high. I wonder how much the  
transom is dragging.  Filming a short video of the wake can be  
instructive or watching someone of similar weight in the boat.

Also what do you mean by "simple" GPS?

The 380mm prop I have on the V14 hull has about 3% slip.  The 520mm  
on the V15 is just over 1% - not really measurable but that is  
calculated.

Mike Lampi has started building the 6m version of my V15 design.  He  
is using 4mm ply that will be finished with glass cloth.  The ply was  
machine cut so saves a lot of work making and cutting panels.  He is  
updating his blog on the project:
http://hpb-er.blogspot.com/

I have been pushing the V15 boat to see how the new box would hold  
up.  I broke it last week end.  It failed at the torque level Mitrpak  
advised, which translated to around 350W on the boat.  It was not the  
shear pin that failed but rather the output shaft where it has a  
shoulder to support the small gear.  The ID of the gear is only 8mm  
so it is not unexpected when I back calculate.  This weekend I will  
start doing some long distance testing at sustainable power of 120 to  
130W to see how it all holds together.  That gets the boat between 9  
and 10kph in the current set up with outriggers set a bit low for my  
weight.  Their height can be adjusted but not easily.


If you can email me a drawing of the hull or photos showing the shape  
I can do some drag predictions for you.

Rick
Your prop slip figures are similar to those given by the PropSim =
program.
I will test one of  my non-folding props to see if it is the hinge zone =
that is causing the problem.
My simple GPS is a Holux 245 which gives Max and current speed, distance =
and time.Speed/time or distance can be plotted onto my computer.

Thanks for the tips on the angle grinders.  I knew that dead ones must be
useful for something!

Rick
I checked out a rigid prop fitted to my small cat and was very surprised =
to find
that the speeds and the cadence were identical to my new boat fitted =
with the folding prop
It is quite difficult to get exact figures due to the river current =
which made a difference of 10%=20
based on 80 rpm.
It all ended with a bang when I hit something under water and bent one =

back 40 mm.
I have concluded that my props are rubbish and I am going back to the =

Dennis
My folding prop is slightly more efficient than the fixed blades I have.
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/folding_prop.jpg

I have a prop optimising program that I use for prop design.  It is a  
bit more flexible than JavaProp and I can use a wide range of foil  
sections.

If you are interested in a design I can give you something that is  
reasonably easy to make using stainless flatbar.
rickwill@bigpond.net.au

It may sound odd but I have seen quite a few people mount blades  
backwards on boats.  They have the curved face facing aft.  This  
alters the effective pitch considerably from what is designed.

I am a sailor and a cyclist.  I'm in the process of buying a 20ft mini-crui=
ser (for details see http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html) and I'm hop=
ing, in my imminent retirement, to sail through Europe on its great network=
 of waterways. The boat will have an outboard, but I'd love to be able to p=
ropel it using a bicycle - for example on days when there's no wind, or if =
I have a stretch of narrow water where I have to battle a headwind.

Ideally, I would use my road bike, mounted in the cockpit on a stand fore a=
nd aft, with a chain on the rear-wheel cog to drive a cog on the stern of t=
he boat, which in turn drives an outboard-style propeller.  Any suggestions=
 as to where I might get hold of the bike-powered outboard kit would be muc=
h appreciated.

Something like this? http://www.shuttlebike.com/ There is also a version 
made in Oz which is supposed to be more efficient discussed somewhere on 
boat design forums discussion. The main issues are large losses when going 
through the wheel of an existing bike. Rick Willoughby has written of a non 
bike, dedicated drive system that can move a large vessel at about 3 knots 
or so..

Hope this helps,


Vic

We have just received our first shipment of Mitrpak T-102-M right  
angle drives customized for hpb use.

The drives have an increaser ratio of 1:2, and have crank posts that  
fit J.I.S. cranks (all unicycle cranks and most standard bike cranks).  
The output shaft is 12 mm, with an offset groove for easy and  
inexpensive cotter pin attachment to your shaft's coupler.

These gearboxes have many bolt holes for different deck attachment  
orientations, and are rated to at least 75 in.-lbs of torque. Rick  
Willoughby pushed his one-off version to the breaking point, and  
Mitrpak has slightly altered the pinion/gear interface to strengthen  
it a bit.

You can find details at www.marcopoloboats.com. The photo shows only  
the standard T-102-M, not our customized version.

Roger,

It sounds like you are going the route of using a bicycle because you  
wish to disconnect the cycle for land use, no? Do you have the H20 or  
Hunter 20 Fox C?

I'm not sure if it will work for you, but in six weeks I will have  
available to the market a two meter flexible cable shaft engineered  
for aquatic pedal use. It has a rating of 200 in.-pounds torque, made  
of 316 stainless wire, and flexible enough to handle a 90 degree turn  
over distance.

If you used a stationary bike stand, I can envision fixing (weld) a 26  
mm long x 12 mm diameter post to it's spinning axle. You might lose  
efficiency between your tire and this axle, but I am going with your  
desire to use a bike. Then it is only a matter of attaching the  
shaft's female coupler with a 1/4 inch (6 mm) cotter pin onto the  
post, and gradually over a distance of two feet turn the cable to the  
stern. It looks like on either boat you could drill a hole in the  
stern just above the deck, off center and away from the rudder. You  
would fabricate a solid shaft and shaft support at the gradual angle  
you need to submerge the prop. Use an Igus plastic bearing in the  
hole, and attach the cable to the solid shaft just inside the boat,  
again using a simple cotter pin for quick disconnect. This external  
shaft assembly could easily be detachable when not needed.

The cable has a nylon tube around it in order to fix the cable and not  
allow it to slither, You could mount the cable either permanently with  
closed clips or temporarily with clips that can be opened along the  
base of the cockpit at the vertical surface.

Since your road bike has a free spinning axle, you would not be able  
to pedal in reverse.

I do not yet have a price for the cable, but I am sure it will be less  
than $250 US delivered, possibly even to Europe. This system is not as  
elegant as the ShuttleBike, but a lot less expensive.

I have tried to attach a crude sketch, but the email kicks back

Roger,

There was an Italian outfit that did just what you describe on the market
maybe 5 or 10 years ago.  Haven't heard about it recently.  You might try an
internet search for it.

I am a sailor and a cyclist.  I'm in the process of buying a 20ft
mini-cruiser (for details see http://www.britishhunter.co.uk/page2.html) and
I'm hoping, in my imminent retirement, to sail through Europe on its great
network of waterways. The boat will have an outboard, but I'd love to be
able to propel it using a bicycle - for example on days when there's no
wind, or if I have a stretch of narrow water where I have to battle a
headwind.

Ideally, I would use my road bike, mounted in the cockpit on a stand fore
and aft, with a chain on the rear-wheel cog to drive a cog on the stern of
the boat, which in turn drives an outboard-style propeller.  Any suggestions
as to where I might get hold of the bike-powered outboard kit would be much
appreciated.

Mark

Thanks for this.  I'm buying the H20 Sport which has the large open cockpit=
.

Your solution sounds gloriously simple.  I do indeed want to be able to use=
 the bike on land.  I'm planning to put a timber seat across the centre of =
the cockpit which, among other things, will carry the mainsheet traveller, =
 I thought I might have a front wheel quick-release axle mounted on it: I w=
ould attach the front forks to that and have the rear wheel on the bike sta=
nd, with maybe lines from either side of the boat to hold the bike vertical=
.  If my schoolboy maths is correct, the cable shaft (assuming a smooth cur=
ve) would have a radius of approx 1.3mtrs which should fit easily in the co=
ckpit

My original thought was to drive the propeller with a chain, but that would=
 presumably involve two sets of direction-changing cogs, which I guess woul=
d take quite a toll on the efficiency of the mechanism.  Do you have any se=
nse of how efficient would a cable shaft turning through 90 degrees would b=
e, compared with a chain and cog mechanism?

Thanks again for your help.

Roger,

It sounds like you are going the route of using a bicycle because you =20
wish to disconnect the cycle for land use, no? Do you have the H20 or =20
Hunter 20 Fox C?

I'm not sure if it will work for you, but in six weeks I will have =20
available to the market a two meter flexible cable shaft engineered =20
for aquatic pedal use. It has a rating of 200 in.-pounds torque, made =20
of 316 stainless wire, and flexible enough to handle a 90 degree turn =20
over distance.

If you used a stationary bike stand, I can envision fixing (weld) a 26 =20
mm long x 12 mm diameter post to it's spinning axle. You might lose =20
efficiency between your tire and this axle, but I am going with your =20
desire to use a bike. Then it is only a matter of attaching the =20
shaft's female coupler with a 1/4 inch (6 mm) cotter pin onto the =20
post, and gradually over a distance of two feet turn the cable to the =20
stern. It looks like on either boat you could drill a hole in the =20
stern just above the deck, off center and away from the rudder. You =20
would fabricate a solid shaft and shaft support at the gradual angle =20
you need to submerge the prop. Use an Igus plastic bearing in the =20
hole, and attach the cable to the solid shaft just inside the boat, =20
again using a simple cotter pin for quick disconnect. This external =20
shaft assembly could easily be detachable when not needed.

The cable has a nylon tube around it in order to fix the cable and not =20

closed clips or temporarily with clips that can be opened along the =20

Thanks for this.  There is indeed an Italian device, called a shuttlebike, =
with a fancy website showing how it operates.  The gadget itself wouldn't h=

Here's the other option which I mentioned is more efficient 
http://www.akwakat.co.nz/index.php?page=specifications You have the front 
sprocket driving directly to the prop thru chain and gears, so you bypass 
frictional losses of using a tire drive.

That's more like it!  Many thanks.  I think the frame will do exactly what =
I want, and the floats will make a handy tender.  Terrific!

Thought this concept might be of interest:

http://www.hydrovisions.com/

Maybe the concept could be worked to make the hydrofoil run shallow and self 
adjusting at speed. That might get the proa or even a cat to work like a 
single, more efficient hull even in chop. Think it would be better than 
trimaran outriggers slamming into waves?

Also on the folding prop, seems easier to make at least since there is no 
welding involved?

Hi Vic,

So long as you have adequate depth and don't run into any weeds, this
isn't too bad. Around here, however, I'd find the outrigger foil gathering
all sorts of foliage (foilage? :-) ) and have to find some way to clear
it.

Yes, with this foil running shallow where most weeds are, not work to well.

Here's another link showing how some commercial products are approaching 
Rick's design:
http://www.triaksports.com/paddling/

Fairly lightweight and good speed according to the web site, anyway. How to 
convert to prop?....

Have you tried a folding prop with your boat, Mike, and how well does it 
work in weeds?

Thanks,

Vic

The photo gallery claims they were using the rear-positioned outriggers
back in 2005, which pre-dates, or was concurrent with, Rick's design.

24 pounds for the wing seems a bit heavy, but the weights for the floats
(5.5 lbs each) is about right for a commercial standard duty boat built
from standard materials.

With a standard kayak-like cockpit it would require a bit of surgery to
make room for moving legs, though either a Spin-Fin-like drive or a
flexible shaft drive could be incorporated fairly easily.

I have not tried a folding prop with the Cadence. It would probably work
fairly well so far as weeds are concerned, but it would cause problems
with the rudder if one rested the boat on its bottom while beached. With a
fixed propeller the boat rests on the blades, and the rudder is not
carrying the load.

HI Roger,

You have named my dream trip ... please tell me more.  I was going to use a
5 meter sail boat with a cat mizzen rigging as boats are taxed and charged
by length and I am told that 5 meters is the limit of free boats.  I wanted
electric power too.  I had the ideal boat for many years 5 meters and slept
4.  I only needed two but guests are nice.  carry a scooter on deck for land
transport and a bicycle. too.  I would love to know all your details.

Huggs and my best wishes,
Bobby Ray

Hello,
as far as I know, the 5 meter limit is valid at least here in France.
If you are interested in auxiliary electric power you should have a look =
at
the torqueedo products which seem to be more efficient than some other
competitors - see
http://www.torqeedo.com/en/hn/products/cruise-r/product-description.html =
 =20

I'm not sure to which degree auxiliary pedal power can contribute to =
move
heavy boats.

This summer I experienced a three day trip on an Escargot, a human =
powered
boat weighing roughly one ton. The Escargot (literally translated =
"snail"),
designed by naval architect Philip Thiel is a charming tiny houseboat,
indeed.=20
Yet it takes some patience to get adapted to its speed limit. Cruising =
speed
without auxiliary power (electric) was around 3 km per hour. Powered by =
2
adults - each one contributing around 100 Watts.=20
For more information on the "Escargot" see: http://www.gruene-flotte.de/

My conclusion from this 3 day trip:=20
Human powered boats should rather be lightweight.

Best wishes=20
Clemens

Clem
The claimed performance with two pedallers is 6.4kph.  Was the bottom  
fouled?  That will make a huge difference on any heavy boat where  
viscous drag dominates.

Also the two Seacycle units are not well matched to heavy loads.  The  
pedal drive I have for the 8t catamaran swings a 780mm diameter large  
model aeroplane prop.  Large swept area becomes more critical to  
achieve efficiency with heavy load at low speed.

A well designed 1t boat should be capable of sustaining between 7 to  
8kph with two pedallers working around 100W.  Typically a sailing  
boat hull will be a bit easier to drive than the barge type hull.

I do agree with the conclusion that weight is important but probably  
not as bad as your experience suggests.  The 5m length limit for free  
passage may be more serious.

This summer I experienced a three day trip on an Escargot, a human  
powered
boat weighing roughly one ton. The Escargot (literally translated  
"snail"),
designed by naval architect Philip Thiel is a charming tiny houseboat,
indeed.
Yet it takes some patience to get adapted to its speed limit.  
Cruising speed
without auxiliary power (electric) was around 3 km per hour. Powered  
by 2
adults - each one contributing around 100 Watts.
For more information on the "Escargot" see: http://www.gruene-flotte.de/

My conclusion from this 3 day trip:
Human powered boats should rather be lightweight.

Best wishes
Clemens

The Escargot is a real human powered barge-like houseboat. When I pedaled
the original boat freshly launched on Lake Union many years ago with
another strong pedaler, we were working very hard to get the boat to move.
Unfortunately, we had no speed measuring tools, and there was quite a
breeze to contend with. The large, flat sides and flat bottom made
maneuvering and staying on course difficult.

Note that the boat I pedaled had no equipment, bedding, food, etc.,
installed, either.

In a canal environment it would probably be a good fit, especially if
fitted with bumpers all around.

Clem's trial boat probably did have some bottom fouling, but that boat
would not move very quickly under human power.

Hi Rick,
good questions!
Although I swam in the Ruhr at least twice a day I did not inspect the
bottom thoroughly. I do remember some green stuff and some mussels on =
the
rudder and on the auxiliary electric drive. These are hints for severe
fouling on the bottom, too.

The "green fleet" of Escargot boats on the Ruhr does not use the =
Seacycle's
drive units.
Instead, two bicycle pedal units are connected to a single propeller. I
guess the setup is not very efficient - but it sure makes a lot of =
noise.

Thank you for the interesting data on heavier HPBs!

Two days after our 3-day trip on the Escargot, Caroline and I made a =
bike
tour along the french canal connecting the rivers Rhine and Marne.
What a sensation of speed!! It felt like flying along the banks of the =
canal
at low level. Even the numerous locks could'nt slow down our amazing =
fast
flight :-)) =20


In August I finally took the effort to start with the new platform for =
the
Seacycle.
It took a lot of time but so far it has been a good experience and
successful project.
Dimensions are 2.4 x 1.6 x 0.12 meters.
The construction made of carbon fibre, epoxy resin and foam weighs 17 =
kg,
additional weight is caused by rudder, steering handle and by the wooden
planks (thin and small) on top.   =20
On Saturday I want to test the new setup on a nearby lake.=20
Will send some photos.

Best greetings=20
Clem =20

My sister finally got down to Melbourne to test the boat I built for  
her.  She is able to do 8kph at a relaxed, sustainable power lever  
and can push up to 12kph for a minute or so.  The corresponding  
speeds for effort in her Hobie flapper are 5kph and 7kph.  This is a  
clip from last weekend (3.3Mb):
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_Donna_1.wmv
Most of the noise is wind and my outriggers slapping the ripples.   
The gearbox noise on her boat can be heard when she pushes her speed  
up.  As a matter of interest she later tested with my cycling shoes  
rather than the rubber beach shoes and found those more natural  
although they are a couple of sizes too big.  The pedals can be used  
with or without cleated shoes or even bare feet.

I have modified the boat somewhat from the original build.  The main  
change is the gearbox.  The initial box was a Mitrpak T-102-M  
modified for cranks.  I broke one of these pushing the boat up to  
around 13kph and a friend broke one just accelerating - told him to  
stay below 12kph but did not say do not accelerate hard.  The boxes  
fail at the high speed shaft.  I have rebuilt one using higher  
strength steel in the shaft and Mitrpak are supplying redesigned  
shafts that will be stronger than the original.

Irrespective of the Mitrpak box improvements I decided there are a  
few disadvantages to swinging the 540mm prop required for a 1:2  
ratio.  The 1:4 box I have made has at least three times the torque  
rating of the Mitrpak box and allows me to swing a 400mm prop.  The  
box has straight cut bevel gears because these cost less than spiral  
bevel and I was a little uncertain I could achieve the required  
fabricating tolerances with my little mill and lathe.  If I make more  
boxes I will use spiral bevel gears mainly because they run quieter.   
They also have slightly higher ultimate strength and many times  
higher wear life although I doubt the latter will ever get tested on  
a pedal boat.  The box weighs 2.5kg.

I now have to make a few minor adjustments and clean the boat up  
before the road trip to the Gold Coast at the end of the year.

Thanks for the report. On the gear box strength issues, I often wondered 
about some kind of slip clutch mechanism to protect from shock overloads. 
That could save someone from being stranded or being knocked out of a race. 
Something might be worked out with say, super strong magnets to be used for 
coupling the shafts without having the slippage drawback of friction based 
units. I can visualize someone going full tilt on the Murray and hitting a 
log or rock thus breaking or bending something that can be repaired 
rapidly....

The box I have made could only be regarded as a prototype. I use =20
standard size aluminium flat and round to make it.  It is held =20
together with stainless bolts.  It took about 8 hours of effort to =20
produce it.

A friend here is investigating having the casing cast.  This is some =20
time off though as I am still playing around with other ideas for the =20=

gearing.

I have been working with Mitrpak but they can only make a 1:2 ratio =20
at this stage.

I also have an Involute gearbox that has a 1:3.3 ratio.  George Tatum =20=

arranged for their manufacture in India.  I think George still has =20
some and both Ian Cassell and I bought ours from India in the last =20
few years.  These cost less than  the gears would cost to buy =20
elsewhere.   Involute may be able to produce something in small =20
quantity with 1:4 or higher ratio.

The Involute boxes weigh 3.8kg which is quite heavy but they are =20
tremendously strong.  I expect the shafts would shear before the =20
gears fail.  The gears I used are good for peak power somewhere over =20
500W in normal boat application but a strong cyclist can exceed this =20
quite easily.  I have been told sprint cyclist can shear standard =20
shafts.

Rick

Hello Rick,

As always your writing is quite interesting.
As you know, I am working on a human power rotomolded kayak project =20
with a rigid
shaft directly set on the gearbox.
As the propeller is located below, and protected by 2 keels, it is =20
not possible
to set a big propeller, that=92s why I tend to put a 1:4 box and an =20
average size
prop (rather 340 mm in my case).
I currently build myself this box for the time being but it is =20
difficult and
time consuming. That=92s why I would be enthusiastic to be able to buy =20=

one.
Would you have some pictures of your 1:4 box and an idea of its =20
selling price if
ever?

Many thanks, David,



Best regards,

David Adrian

Hello Everyone,

In response to David Adrian's interest in drive units we have some used
Nauticraft drive units for sale - ranging from $200 to $500 - shipping not
included of course. (Our new ones are $650.)  These units would include our
15 in.  (385mm) two blade propeller (custom injection molded for us) but no
drive shaft (we now use 3/4"  acetal (POM) rod for the Escapade but support
it in several places; our Encore has 1 1/8" od aluminum tubing shafts).  A
3/4" diameter seal/bushing is also included.  The ratio is 1:4 (21: 84 tooth
sprockets).  Keep in mind that our drive system is designed for recreational
boat use - not ultimate performance.  Contact myself or Laurie.

Curt Chambers
Nauticraft Corp.

I delivered V15-5m to my sister on the Gold Coast in southern  
Queensland.

We had some nice time on the water near her home on the Gold Coast.

This is a series of clips taken on the Nerang River:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fBLi40q4pU
She has hundreds of kilometers of similar waterways all connected and  
many launching points only a few minutes drive from her house.

The warmer water was nice for some speed runs.  I hit 18.4kph during  
this run:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s5jmnqNpIA
If you look closely the lift due to dynamic forces is apparent.  The  
small waves amplify it in the clip.  In calm water I get the first  
600mm of the bow clear of the water.

         V15 looks good, must be a great place for these
sort of boats. Is the gearbox the original Mitrepak one
or have you upgraded it?

Cool design. Up higher from the water, yet the fairing behind the seat would 
appear to reduce wind resistance. Seems to give a dry ride to the pedaller. 
Thanks for posting.

I made the gearbox from a purchased 1:4 gearset.  They are straight  
cut bevel gears that cost USD100.

The gearbox is noisier than spiral bevel gears but similar efficiency.

This one weighed 2.8kg however I have since modified the design and  
will use spiral bevel gears for the next one. The gearset is heavier  
but the box will be lighter.

I repaired one of the Mitrpak boxes I broke using higher strength  
steel.  It will take at least 300W now.  In the end I did not like  
the 1:2 ratio for such a light boat.  The big prop is a nuisance for  
a variety of reasons. One less obvious problem is the induced roll  
due to the higher torque.  It also has a greater tendency to "walk"  
sideways than a higher speed prop.

As far as gear ratio goes I determine a step up ratio between 4 to 5  
to be near optimum for an easily driven boat.  Your 1:3.3 is not far  
off optimum - way better than 1:2.  You only problem is getting a  
shaft that is stiff enough torsionally while still able to curve.

Vic
The height of the seat on V15 is not much different to V14.  The step  
in the deckline gives the impression of the seat being higher.

The low deck at the cranks means the seating can be more upright,  
which is something my sister wanted.  I prefer being more reclined  
but like the low deck at the crank to keep the feet lower.  Helps  
with blood flow to the feet.  Once moving there is little tendency  
for water to wash onto the lower deck in waves because the divergent  
wave from the bow forms a trough along the side of the hull. This  
will be less so with a 6m long hull because the divergent waves are  
smaller.

I have continued to play with the V15 design mainly to simplify  
construction and improve load paths for strength.  There are a few  
people building various alternatives of this design.

I would not recommend the extended fairing behind the seat.  It does  
reduce frontal windage but this can be achieved with a shorter tail- 
box.  It increases the roll force when side on to wind.  With wind on  
the bow quarter there is a noticeable tendency to sail but this has  
limited application.

The V15 design has a distinct advantage over V14 when pushing into  
wind and waves.  There is no tendency for water to wash back over the  
bow when it buries and the reduced windage is significant in even  
slight wind.  It also surfs better because the bow does not dive and  
it does not flop roll with the outriggers set aft.

The flat rocker increases the turning circle over V14 and this  
requires making allowance when in tight spaces.  For this reason it  
does have quite good reverse because I have limited the angle of  
folding on the prop.  It is quite easy to get up to 5kph in reverse.   
So in narrow canals she needs to execute a 3-point turn and think  
about how the boat will be affected by any wind.  Her Hobie turned  
much better but she averaged half the speed and had a few scares in  
strong currents where she could not make headway.

I think the advice on a step up of 1:5 or less only pertains to a  
situation where the fluctuating torque of a single rider is used.  It  
reduces the loss during the low-power parts of the cycle.  The high  
pitch is a compromise, pushing water around as much as back.   
Usually, the best efficiency is found when the pitch and diameter are  
nearly the same, leading to a step-up of around 1:10 for a tandem  
with the pedals out of phase.

I am discussing a single person easily driven displacement hull.

The optimisation around a ratio of 4 to 5 considers many factors:
1.  I am running a 390mm diameter prop achieving 3.1m/s at 75rpm on  
the crank.  Pitch of current prop is nominally 620mm. So P/D is 1.6.
2. The optimum P/D is a function of the L/D of the blades.  The lower  
the L/D the higher the P/D for best efficiency.  I am achieving an L/ 
D around 20 at my operating condition over the working portion of the  
blade. The most efficient part of the blade is toward the outside of  
the blade.  My current blades have slightly larger chord toward the  
outside but it is not much better than just constant chord blades,  
which I often use.
3. With the large diameter to thrust, I have very low disc loading so  
this results in low slip - or high actuator disc efficiency.
4.  The large diameter enables me to use only two blade prop while  
still keeping high aspect blades.  This reduces induced drag on the  
blades.  These two blades have sufficient strength to transmit the  
thrust without flexing noticeably.  The minimum chord for a steel  
blade capable of taking full sprint thrust of say 100N is not less  
than 20mm.
5. The torsional stiffness of the drive train favours spinning the  
prop faster to avoid poor RMS to average power.  This was a key  
factor with my dislike for the 1:2 ratio.  For this reason I consider  
1:4 about the minimum ratio with a shaft drive system although there  
may be some layup of carbon fibre that would work at lower ratios  
without becoming unreasonably heavy.

I could not imagine the circumstances with a displacement boat where  
a ratio of 1:10 would result in the best efficiency.  There may be a  
situation with very easily driven boat such as a hydrofoil where 1:10  
could be close to optimum.  With my boat using a 250mm diameter prop  
I would throw away 7% in disc losses compared with 3% with the 390mm  
prop.

If anyone is interested in prop optimisation they might find these  
notes of interest:
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-23-hydrofoils-and- 
propellers-spring-2007/readings/kerwin_notes.pdf
There are some useful curves toward the end that can be applied even  
to the lightly loaded case of a pedal boat prop.

Rick




I think the advice on a step up of 1:5 or less only pertains to a
situation where the fluctuating torque of a single rider is used.  It
reduces the loss during the low-power parts of the cycle.  The high
pitch is a compromise, pushing water around as much as back.
Usually, the best efficiency is found when the pitch and diameter are
nearly the same, leading to a step-up of around 1:10 for a tandem
with the pedals out of phase.

       Have been playing around a bit with shafts and
have got a straight 16mm aluminium shaft held in
place with a skeg. The angle is 16 deg which is way
off optimum but makes setting up easier. The flex=20
shafts always hit a dead spot at high revs and limits
the top speed. I can lower the gearbox another 100mm
by cutting out part of the hull for my feet and this improves
the angle to 11deg. Don't know if the effort of doing this
will greatly improve the performance, a bit of work and
more weight.
        Will be at the lake tomorrow.

The angle does not affect efficiency greatly.  The main problem is  
the vibration and high bending loads.  If you have to go to a heavy  
shaft to reduce torsional compliance then it will be strong enough to  
take the bending loads.  However I once bent a 12mm aluminium shaft  
when going hard with a 1:3.5 reduction.

My main issue with the inclined shaft is the ever present vibration.   
It gets more noticeable as you go faster.  If this is not annoying  
you then live with the current inclination.  You are probably looking  
at hull number 3 to do the stepped deck.  I keep simplifying this  
arrangement so it is easier to make.

I have had a carbon fibre shaft wound for me with only diagonal  
fibres so it is stiff torsionally but compliant in bending.  I am yet  
to install it on anything.  It weighs a fraction of steel and even  
lighter than aluminium but 4 times stiffer torsionally than my  
current steel shaft.

I have a reasonably accurate model now for assessing the impact of  
shaft compliance.  A 12mm Al shaft that is 3m long, using your 1:3.3  
ratio, will be robbing around 8% of your power input due to the shaft  
torsional compliance.

I should see you at the lake tomorrow.

I forgot to add that going up to 16mm reduces the apparent loss to  
the compliance to 1%.  So it is a significant improvement and close  
to as good as you can get with a shaft drive system.  It will feel  
very well connected to the prop.

Your 16mm shaft has 60% of the stiffness of the 13.7mm OD, 10mm ID CF  
shaft I have to test.

If you are interested I can show you the dynamic analysis at my place  
later in the day. Also the CF shaft and other things I am playing with.

Rick, Ian, et al,

I now have delivery of the flexible cable shafts I ordered. They are 2  
meters long, have a 7.94 wound core, and are made of 316 stainless  
steel. The female couplers on each end accept 12 mm  shafts and have  
an offset 6.35 mm hole drilled for a cotter pin to hold the shaft with  
a corresponding half cut (per Rick's suggestion). The cable is covered  
with a .5" o.d. nylon tube so that the cable can be clamped at various  
points.

These shafts can flex around objects and can even bend to 90 degrees  
with enough curve radius. Possible advantages include using the prop  
for steering and easy prop raising for shallow water.

I am just now setting one up in my workshop, along with an MPB  
MitrpakDrive and our PlanetDrive to see how well they work together.  
All our water is frozen here, so I cannot test outside.

Rick, if you are interested, I will send you one for free given all  
the help you have provided. The shafts can be purchased for US $225,  
US shipping included.

Email me if you are interested and I will send photos.


Thank  you,

While you are testing in the workshop can you measure the torsional  
stiffness.  If you just give me the degrees it flexes with a certain  
load at a known radius I can calculate the torsional stiffness.

 From this value I can work out the apparent loss in the drive  
train.  If this is similar to the CF shaft I have I will be  
interested in testing one.

My CF shaft is 3.1m long but it only needs to curve over 1.2m of its  
length.  It would be easy to make a rigid extension from your shaft  
to get the required length for an aft mounted prop.  The one-off CF  
shaft cost me AUD300 but the cost would reduce for higher quantity.

I am now mounting the prop behind the hull so it can easily flex  
upward if it hits something solid.  I used a 10mm X 3mm tension strut  
on V15 that can slide upward.

A friend, building a pedal boat here, copied one of my fixed bladed  
props and has moulded aluminium and bronze blades from the resulting  
pattern.  He is also working on a lighter nylon/glass version.  He  
only has a couple at this stage and he gave me one with aluminium  
blades for testing.  It suits a ratio around 1:4 or a bit lower if  
the hull moves easily.  The linked image gives an idea of what the  
bronze one looks like:

He has talked about selling them if there is enough interest.

I now have delivery of the flexible cable shafts I ordered. They are 2
meters long, have a 7.94 wound core, and are made of 316 stainless
steel. The female couplers on each end accept 12 mm  shafts and have
an offset 6.35 mm hole drilled for a cotter pin to hold the shaft with
a corresponding half cut (per Rick's suggestion). The cable is covered
with a .5" o.d. nylon tube so that the cable can be clamped at various
points.

These shafts can flex around objects and can even bend to 90 degrees
with enough curve radius. Possible advantages include using the prop
for steering and easy prop raising for shallow water.

I am just now setting one up in my workshop, along with an MPB
MitrpakDrive and our PlanetDrive to see how well they work together.
All our water is frozen here, so I cannot test outside.

Rick, if you are interested, I will send you one for free given all
the help you have provided. The shafts can be purchased for US $225,
US shipping included.

Email me if you are interested and I will send photos.

Thank  you,

Mark A. Vermilion

Hi Rick, Mark and all
I believe there is 'enough interest' both for the propeller and a complete
flex shaft propulsion system.
This opinion comes from the sustained growth of the Open Waterbike Project:
the community is still tiny (just over ten thousand unique vistors, just a
few hundreds members)  but autonomously growing nothwhitstanding our very
limited resources. We have requests from individuals and firms, coming in
 from countries as different as Brasil, Turkey, India (but now the
baricenter has shifted from Europe to the US). Most people and perspective
dealers and manufacturers are intersted in buying the drive system, while it
seems appealing to most is the possibility of building locally  hulls and
other less critical and cumbersome parts, and they seek technical support
for that.
I reckon the availability of a complete high performance drive system will
be the turning point: maybe the dream of an 'Open' high performance pedal
boat has a real possibility of becoming reality after all..m.

Dennis
I expect when you get your stabilisers mounted at the right height  
you will find the narrow chord, high pitch prop will work fine.  They  
may need a redesign to work well.

Right now your boat has much more drag than it should.  In your  
summer I hope you get the opportunity to set it up correctly.  The  
stabilisers should literally skim the surface once at design speed.   
My stabilises sit about 20mm above the surface when at rest.  At  
11kph the sinkage and bow wave combine to get their stern just  
touching.  This is what you should aim for.

The prop design can be done with great precision but it is reliant on  
accurate determination of the boat drag, which equals the prop  
thrust.  Your main hull is not draggy but your stabilises will be if  
continually loaded in any way.

I have found flat bottom stabilises, 2m long and 100mm wide to be  
about the best.  They achieve close to maximum stability as soon as  
they hit the surface. So there is little tendency to flop roll even  
though they sit above the surface most of the time in calm water or  
clip waves in rougher water.

If you cannot reduce the drag then you would be better off going to a  
slightly larger diameter prop with similar pitch and slightly large  
blade area.  But you should fix the high drag problem before going to  
this measure.

My prop blades usually operate with a negative angle of attack so are  
a long way from stalling.  The 25mm chord is a little more forgiving  
in strong wind than a wider blade.

You will note that the prop my friend has copied and turned into a  
folding prop has a maximum chord of 45mm.  This will work OK on quite  
draggy hulls but is not as efficient as my 25mm chord on V14.

I am glad you find 1:4 a nice ratio and look forward to some more  
performance results when you get decent stabilises properly set.   
This is where you will get the most immediate gain.  Then try the  
25mm chord prop.

Dennis, I think the statements above are a good summary.  I would approach 
it by defining the end goal first and consider the motor you have to work 
with, then work backwards. Prioritize the main goal whether it is sprinting, 
endurance, draft, weight,  durability, etc. Computer design programs can be 
helpful but tweaking through dynamic testing can be used for further 
improvement.  I think
Rick does that on some level, otherwise why all the different creations? His 
sister's boat uses a limited range folder and perhaps has other changes 
compared to his own...

Dennis
Some time ago I took a clip of one of my stabilises operating in calm  
water.

The boat is doing about 10kph in this clip:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Stabiliser.wmv
The port stabiliser is doing exactly the same because the boat was  
level.  That is all they should be doing if set up right.  In waves  
they can be even set higher but I do not have easy adjustment to  
enable that.

The initial stability is related to the second moment of area of the  
water plane alone.  So what counts is how much moment you gain with a  
slight list.  Having a long flat stabiliser set about 1m from the  
centre of the main hull will rapidly increase the second moment of  
area with very little list.  Being long and slender the drag does not  
increase much if it is lightly loaded.  That is the objective I set  
out to achieve with the shape of my stabilisers.

This commercial product is not a flex shaft, but is available for those 
inquires looking for a drive system. http://www.prophish.com/pedalboats.html 
It appears to be a rugged (Jose's adventure NY-Rio), somewhat adaptable unit 
with built in steering and easy lift and lower. Don't know the drive ratio, 
but possibly adaptable to a version of Rick's prop which would improve 
efficiency.

Hope this helps.

Hello Rick,

Though I mostly "lurk" in this forum these days, i always appreciate 
the contributions of you and others who have much more understanding of
the design use of math, computers, etc., than myself. Prop-stuff is way 
over my head. ;-)

Regarding your suggestion for stabilizer shape:  I am wondering whether 
facts related to "planing" conditions entered into your "flat bottom" 
decision, ...i.e. when visualizing the stabilizer as an independent 
hull, the speed/length ratio of the immersed portion of the stabilizer 
is very much greater than that of the main hull, and thus into commonly 
accepted "planing" territory. Also, as the main hull bow rises with 
speed, the stabilizer angle of attack may approach (or could be 
designed to approach) nearly ideal planing angles (4-5 degrees?)?

Of course choppy water changes the AofA constantly, but it seems likely 
that in calm water these observations would be pertinent.

Unless the hull is momentarily overly unstable, only the rearmost 
undersurface of the stabilizer should be in contact, so the aspect 
ratio of the contact area should also be in a favorable range for 
planing.

I'd value your thoughts,

PS - I remain in awe of your speed of implementation of ideas and 
fabrication of models!

Larry

Rick

Sorry , but I must have confused you slightly, the boat was fitted with =
narrow flat bottomed stabilisers for the last few tests. These were =
mounted about 30 mm clear of the water surface and parallel to the boat =
bottom
.
I still suspect the 185 mm wide square stern and have been thinking of =
raising this up by moving the my seat and drive system 75 mm forward. =
which intern would lower the front slightly.

You are right about the stabilisers operating primarily with dynamic  
lift at typical operating speed because they are very lightly loaded.

I consider the shape I have arrived at hard to better for all round  
performance.  There would be advantage in being able to trim the  
height when in operation but mine are set at a suitable average.

Wide transoms on planing hulls actually suck the stern down at semi- 
planing speed so readily trim bow-up and then provide a high aspect  
lifting surface at the transom when at high speed.  So they are  
beneficial where there is a lot of power to get on the plane and then  
operate at high speed.  A wide transom would not offer any benefit on  
my stabilisers and would add extra drag when pushing through waves.

I had not realised you had built new stabilisers.

When you get back on the water I would be interested in seeing some  
video of your boat in operation.

There is some potential for aft-down trim to add noticeable drag.   
There would be considerable turbulence associated with the sort of  
energy you are losing and a video will help identify where the  
problem is.

If the stabilisders are no longer dragging then your proposal to  
shift weight forward to lift the stern is a good option for next trial.

The tools are there to optimise your hull shape for minimum drag and  
this will be a much faster method of arriving at the best hull than  
endless trial and error.





Rick

Sorry , but I must have confused you slightly, the boat was fitted  
with narrow flat bottomed stabilisers for
the last few tests. These were mounted about 30 mm clear of the water  
surface and parallel to the boat bottom
.
I still suspect the 185 mm wide square stern and have been thinking  
of raising this up by moving the my seat and
drive system 75 mm forward. which intern would lower the front slightly.

       Had the boat out on Saturday afternoon at the lake.
Weather was calm so I raised the outriggers another
20mm. The boat boat felt a bit unstable with the outriggers
just touching the water. Cranked the speed up for a few
sprints but as I don't have a GPS couldn't tell you the
speed. The straight shaft enables me to push hard without
hitting a dead spot, the shaft angle of 16 deg means a=20
loss in efficiency. Quite a bit of weed about so I mainly=20
stayed down the southern end trying to pace the sailing boats. Current =
setup has a skeg which adds to the drag=20
and might try a smaller rudder next time. Overall pleased
with the way the boat is, light to carry and quick and
easy to setup.=20

I left the lake around midday Saturday - a pity I did not see you.

I thought your outriggers were reasonably well adjusted previously.   
You want them positioned so you your are stable when moving.  This  
will mean a little flop roll at rest.

The 16mm shaft is 3X stiffer torsionally than the 12mm and improves  
RMS to average power input substantially.  You could still get a  
curved shaft of similar torsional stiffness by combining the 16mm  
aluminium through the hull with 8mm spring steel below the hull.  The  
length of steel just enough to give the curve. I can help with the  
join.  This is what I ended up doing on V15.

I did a couple of full length runs of the lake now that it is near  
full height but weed was a nuisance.  The folding prop sheds it OK  
but it means regularly coasting to fold the blades.

You need to get a GPS so you can get some measured data.   Maybe next  
weekend we can have good weather and be somewhere at the same time.

How bad is the prop vibration?

       When I first used the 16mm rigid shaft it vibrated=20
a bit but its something I don't notice now. Inside the 16mm
aluminium tube I have a wooden rod glued into place.
I kept coating the rod with an expanding glue as I=20
pushed it into the tube. This makes the shaft more rigid=20
as well as a bit stiffer torsionally.
        With the 16mm shaft angle I am thinking of making
another prop with a different pitch. For example the prop
at one point is angled at 55 deg but with the 16 deg shaft
angle the actual angle is 71 deg. The prop is only at
optimum in the horizontal and looses in the vertical. If
I made a 4 blade prop with a different pitch to suit the
shaft angle there would be more prop at optimum thrust.
I might be way out here but it would be interesting to see
how such a prop would work.
        Where I often go at the rowing course and the river=20
weed is not a problem, just bump into a jellyfish now
and then.
         Had a lot of expenses of late so the GPS has=20
been put on the backburner. Have to do timed runs at=20
the rowing course.

if you are using a rigid prop,it is possible to modify the prop mounting =
so that you achieve no vibration and get the full power out of the prop. =
This requires a small slot in the prop hub so that it can pivot around a =
pin and be vertical when in the vertical plain.  This is a sort of =
restricted universal joint that was developed by David Witt at Oxford =
university.

I have wondered if this system could be further refined so that it would =
operate on a folding prop with suitable positioned stops.

some magnets and built a prototype:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCuCmzcjpao

The video shows the torque test.  I have a 5kg weight suspended on a  
lever arm connected to the output shaft.  The lever gets out to 230mm  
before the magnets let go. This particular variant has a ratio of  
1:3.3 and gives in at 11Nm on the output shaft.

The torque at this ratio is ample for cruising to speed of up to  
12.5kph but would give out in a sprint.

The unit was not executed to the initial design because I could not  
get the quantity of magnets of the particular size I wanted.  It was  
intended as a 1:5 step up but I could not get the alignment right  
with only 4 magnets on the output so went up to 6 thus reducing the  
ratio.  However I got better than a commensurate increase in torque.

This unit is extremely robust and heavier than I would want in a  
boat.  One feature is that the weight is distributed at a large  
radius so the crank and output both have high rotational inertia -  
flywheels if you like.  This leads to smoother pedaling and can  
compensate a little for a torsionally compliant prop shaft.   Another  
feature is the load limiting on the prop shaft.

If I made it to tighter tolerance I could get higher torque.  In a  
way this would defeat the original idea because I was exploring the  
concept for ease of building without need for precision machining.

I expect with ideal magnet selection and simple method of  
construction this arrangement could be built for under AUD200.

          On my first boat I had two universal joints
to get the prop vertical. The shaft coming off the
gearbox was 25 deg and it resulted in the first change
in angle at 14 deg and the second at 11 deg. I broke
both universal joints at different times. After upgrading=20
to stronger ones I still had problems with the pins
working loose. Also it was not a smooth pedalling
action because of the angle.=20
         Would be interested to have a look at the
restricted universal joint you mentioned. Has he a
website or any info on the internet?

David Witt has several published articles on his boats.These can be =
found under David Witt pedal boats in google.=20
The pivoting prop is not really a universal joint and is not very well =
described but can be found in his article published by Human Power  44V =
13n1 1997.
This can be found at BHPC.org Human Power Journals.
It is simply a slot and a pivot so that the prop can find its own =
vertical position. I would have thought that a 6 to 8 mm pin would be =
strong enough for the prop to pivot on but a collar should be used to =
prevent the prop falling off if the pin broke as did your u-joints.

Thanks for the film clip, great concept. I use these guys who have a large 
selection of neodymium magnets to grade 52 http://www.kjmagnetics.com/  Some 
of their smaller magnets are very lightweight and low cost and so strong 
they can't be pulled apart. Plating may be a little thin for your type of 
project, though.

If that 71 degrees is off the horizontal, seems like a long, untethered flex 
shaft could be used to correct, since it always remain at the optimum. I 
don't know the configuration of your boat, so you may have already 
considered and rejected due to your arrangement. When Greg K set his 24 hour 
distance record with an untethered shaft, it only amounted to about a 2% 
improvement compared to a skeg and inclined rigid shaft, but I don't know if 
the angle of inclination was ever as great as 71 degrees...

Hope this helps.

      I have previously been using a flex shaft but I could
never do a flat out sprint because of the shaft going
through the dead spot. The rigid shaft allows me to
go as hard as I can but the prop is not at the vertical.
I use an involute gearbox connected directly to the
shaft, this makes things simple to build and setup.
I could improve the angle but would get 11 deg max.
and involve a bit of work on the boat.=20
       My prop blade starts at 20 deg off the horizontal
next to the hub and gradually increases to 55 deg at=20
the tip. The prop is 400mm dia, with the prop angled
at 16 deg off the vertical the angle of the blades to
the water increases. If I make a prop with the blades
at 36 deg next to the hub and increase to 71 deg at
the tip the blade should be at the same angle as a
vertical prop. However on the other side of the prop
the angles will be way out and may cause drag on=20
the prop. A four blade prop might be better in this
regard as there would be more prop blades closer
to the optimum.
        I don't have any data worked out as prop design
is a bit over my head, I use java prop for sizing.

Why a dead spot with the flex and not the rigid is what I am wondering? If 
it because of the torsional difference, then a stiffer flex shaft (CF) like 
Rick is using might be a consideration. Or perhaps a thicker but longer 
steel shaft with some flex might be a consideration, if it can bring the 
prop closer to the horizontal. Flywheels either with a heavy prop or crank 
or eliptical? sprockets might be a consideration to take up a dead spot but 
seem like a lot of trouble and introduce other issues.  A 4 blade may give 
you more flywheel effect but also not be as efficient under HP due to 
increased water friction on the blade surface, from what I have gathered. 
The 4 blade alone will not change the angle and you will still have the 
other side of even more blades not aligned to the horizontal at any one 
time,  it would seem to me.

Hope there's some ideas you can use in there, but again you may have 
considered and rejected due to cost or negative trade offs in your design.

We did some testing of the pedal thrusters I made for the sailing  
catamaran today.

Here is a video of one in operation:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/pedal_power.wmv
I was pedalling as well while videoing hence the camera movement.  We  
were able to sustain 2kts into a mild headwind.  In calm conditions  
we got to 2.3kts at sustainable power.  Sprint speed was 3kts.  Not  
very impressive speed but the boat weighs 8 tonne.

The thrusters fold up when not in use:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/folded_pedal_thruster.jpg
Each unit has two Mitrpak gearboxes.  The top box with the cranks has  
a 1:2 ratio.  The bottom box is 1:1.  Prop is 30X20 model aircraft.   
Each unit weighs 11kg.

Cool, thanks for the video and pics, Rick. Where did you find a model air 
prop that was stiff enough, or did the standard fiberglass type work well 
enough?

The props were on special at Hobby City.  They were $13 each plus  
postage:
http://www.hobbycity.com/hobbycity/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=8293
They handle the thrust quite easily.  The continuous power on each  
prop translates to around 100N thrust on each.  Force gets up to  
maybe 200N but still within their capacity.

Rick
        Have been thinking about what you said about
wetted surface area. I did some sums based on a
canoe shaped hull wth flat bottom 5m long and with
a load of 100kg.
I worked out the wetted surface areas for different beams
from 200mm up to 400mm.
Beam  200mm WSA  2.14m2  Draft 145mm
Beam  250mm WSA  2.02m2  Draft 116mm
Beam  300mm  WSA  2.00m2  Draft 97mm
Beam  350mm  WSA  2.00m2  Draft 80mm
Beam  400mm  WSA  2.10m2  Draft 72mm
>From this the 350mm hull might be the best as it
has the lowest draft to WSA. Shows that the narrower
you go does not always give you the fastest hull.

Ian

Somewhere between the 250mm and 300mm will give the lowest drag  
hull.  The wider you go the more wavemaking so you are better off  
staying on the narrow side of the lowest wetted surface.

You can do a little better with a rounded section but then the beam  
goes up unless you go longer.  For speed under 12kph the round  
section will be 1 to 2% better then the rectangular in total drag if  
the same weight but I find it possible to build the boat lighter with  
flat sections.  You also get a slight advantage from the flat bottom  
with planing forces above 14kph.

There is some fine tuning in the ends to get the best combination of  
friction resistance (wetted surface) and wave drag but what you have  
is not far off it.

         Have been thinking about what you said about
wetted surface area. I did some sums based on a
canoe shaped hull wth flat bottom 5m long and with
a load of 100kg.
I worked out the wetted surface areas for different beams
from 200mm up to 400mm.
Beam  200mm WSA  2.14m2  Draft 145mm
Beam  250mm WSA  2.02m2  Draft 116mm
Beam  300mm  WSA  2.00m2  Draft 97mm
Beam  350mm  WSA  2.00m2  Draft 80mm
Beam  400mm  WSA  2.10m2  Draft 72mm
 >From this the 350mm hull might be the best as it
has the lowest draft to WSA. Shows that the narrower
you go does not always give you the fastest hull.

Sorry, I talked about this with Alex off-list and I should have
written everyone especially so the list admins would know details.

I have tried out GoogleGroups with other projects and don't like it. I
prefer to continue with mailman.

I intend to ramp up some projects at HuPI.org over the next months. I
am planning on moving the hpv lists to hupi.org.

I am in the process of setting up a new server for HuPI.org that can
handle more traffic. It will probably be at tektonic.net which worked
well for ihpva.org/whpva.org before I backed out of that fray.

Other than the domain name changing AGAIN... (what is this the 4th
time?) sticking with mailman should make the move relatively painless.
Archives are always a problem but they can continue to live at
bikelist.org at least for now.

Thanks Moz and Bob for offering hosting space. Thanks also to the list
admins for their continued support.

Brian

Kevin
If you want a good result then the starting point is to determine the  
hull drag characteristics and the engine power curve.

As an example I usually design for my sustainainable output of 120 to  
130W.  My slender stabilised monohulls have a total drag around 38N  
at a speed of 3m/s which gives me that power at the cranks.  The prop  
design process is iterative.

The best freely available prop design software is JavaProp:
http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/jp_applet.htm
You need to set the values on the options page to suit water rather  
than air.  You then select the airfoil section.  The E193 at Re# of  
100,000 is a realistic starting point.  You can enter the design  
information you have on the design page and click the design command  
button to get a design.

I use my own design software that has more flexibility than  
JavaProp.  This allows me to produce somewhat simpler designs.

All my latest props have been folding to make weed removal a matter  
of momentary coasting:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Folding_Prop.png
There is little drag when they coast so you can stop pedalling and  
keep moving.  They still have some limited reversing if you spin fast  
enough.

This design avoids welding.  The hub can be toughened nylon or other  
plastic material rather than aluminium.  You do not need a lathe or  
mill to make the hub.  It can be done using a bench drill and decent  
file.  The prop pictured took me 4 hours.  It has efficiency of 85%  
at its design condition, which it is capable of achieving most of the  
time because there is no lost time in removing any fouling.  When you  
have 130W to play with a single piece of weed can easily reduce  
performance.

You can often find model aircraft propellers that will do the job  
such as an APC 16X16.  You will need to select gearing to suit it.

I used a big model plane prop on this application:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Folded_Pedal_Thruster.JPG
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Pedal_Power.wmv
These props cost $14.  The smaller ones for a single person boat are  
usually around $8.

Kevin
To get any advantage using hydrofoils each rider of average weight =20
would need to be able to get to 250W at a miniumum.  Most people can =20
only get this power for very short periods.  If you could produce =20
this power level then the design speed would be something over =20
14kph.  You can get lift off using bigger foils at lower speed and =20
less power but what is the point when you could go faster with less =20
power and much less complexity in displacement mode!

Hydrofoils increase the susceptibility to fouling with weeds and =20
other litter.  They also require considerably greater draft such that =20=

beach launchings becomes a wet affair.

A key step is to decide what you intend to do with the boat.  If it =20
is purely sprinting then hydrofoils would be worth consideration.  If =20=

you want to do longer distance cruising (anything over 5km at a time) =20=

then hydrofoils would not be in the mix unless you are a trained =20
athlete.

An important element in the design is to establish the power output =20
of the engines.  If you do not have this from bike data then it can =20
be determined in a gym on a recumbent cycling machine.  You will then =20=

have a better idea of the possibilities.

Setting up any pedal boat for two people involves more complexity =20
than a single person drive.  The best configuration from a hull =20
efficiency point of view is the stabilised monohull or possibly a =20
monohull without stabilisers with a single drive shaft.  Setting up =20
the mechanical system to get the two cranks to drive the common shaft =20=

is a challenge.

I personally think two boats would be better than one but with two =20
people in a single boat you will be able to go a bit faster.  The =20
problem is you will most likely need two people all the time because =20
the weight of the boat will be greater than a single person can =20
manage.  Also performance with one person will be down on what could =20
be achieved with a single person in a boat specifically designed for =20
the person.

I am currently making my own 1:4 gearboxes.  The first of them are on =20=

the boat I made for my sister seen here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D_fBLi40q4pU
The box is painted yellow so it is easy to see in the clip.  The =20
parts for this box cost a little over AUD300 including the cranks and =20=

pedals.  It weighs 2.8kg.  I have now made a second one with more =20
expensive gear set that weighs 2.3kg.

The selection of the prop shaft is quite important.  If you use high =20
aspect props to get the efficiency then they need to be run in line =20
with water flow to avoid vibration.  I use mostly spring steel or =20
machinable aluminium or a combination of these in a curved =20
arrangement.  I have a yet to be tested shaft made from carbon fibre =20
and wound to my specification to get high torsional stiffness but =20
compliant in bending.

I have tested most possibilities over the years and can give you a =20
reasonable idea of the weaknesses or advantages of any set up.  More =20
importantly I can determine the performance you can expect in =20
whatever configuration you come up with providing you know the weight =20=

of the engines, what you want to carry and the output of the =20
engines.  This can save a lot of trial and error with the associated =20
cost and time.  I provide free design for non-commercial applications.

Re: Prop

Hi Rick,
thanks for the info.It is very helpful. I really like the folding =20
prop and the
boat prop system. I have built a few recumbent bikes in the past and =20

to build a recumbent for two on water. Something not to complicated. =20
We live in
the Dominican Republic at present and would use it on the ocean or =20
lakes near
by. Things are not so easy to find here but some things can be built =20
fairly
cheap. Where can I find information on the drive shaft and prop =20
system. Much
like what you have done.  I was looking at this hydrofoil bike but =20
thought I
should start with something without hydrofoils and try to get the =20
prop system
first.

I'm mostly a reader, but just had to respond to this one.  The fin vs prop 
comparison has been well done and the efficiency of the Hobie flippers is 
really pretty awful - nowhere even close to a human driven prop.

Unless you anticipate tripling the efficiency of the flippers you are 
destined to repeat the past...

Hi Bob,

I'm confident that  Rick is right on top of propellor-stuff, but I'd 
like to hear more about your fin-drive ideas.

Max efficiency is less of an issue when "messing about " is the goal, 
and freedom from weed-wrapped props with the convenience of a kick-up 
drive, combined with the fish-like grace of a flexible fin appeals to 
me.

I wouldn't mind resorting to a paddle for the occasional reverse 
requirement.

I liked the relative simplicity of Harry Bryan's rig, as opposed to the 
bulkier drive that was later developed and discussed for awhile on this 
list. Seems I remember some sort of transparent flex fin on Harry's 
early experiment. I like the esthetics. ;-)

Harry ultimately used a forward fin(skeg) to counter yaw effects, ...I 
was wondering if you had any other ideas on yaw control.

I was wondering whether a split fin with stacked halves in opposed 
motion  would be feasible, or would turbulence between the flow between 
the fin-halves interfere too much to be useful? (Picture a swim-finned 
diver swimming on his side)

I would value any comments you might make (Others' opinions welcome 
too.)

Larry (Bob, I'm not sure if we have communicated via e-mail since your 
move(s?). [ My e-address is lhsmith@wvi.com ]

Thought it well to post the results of the definitive HPB study of Hobie 
breakdown prone flipper system.  However successful the marketing concept 
the results were dismal.  I quote:

"At 3.5 mph the Mirage drive was only 22% efficient (heart rate 107). The 
drive doesn't really get efficient until it reaches 5.3 mph at 46% (heart 
rate 132). Now when you realize that many prop driven HPB's approach 
efficiencies are closer to 70-80% efficient, it's no wonder that in fair, 
head to flipper competitions the Hobie sucks hind teat."

Rick has designed some systems on flexible drives that are easily raised, or 
reversed in cases of heavy weed.  Keep in mind that flipper drives are not 
immune to the same issues.  I am a lifelong kayaker and I can assure you 
that weed is rarely an issue, unless you are in extremely shallow water, 
when neither system is practical.  Try "flipping" in 1 foot of water.  In 
these cases a flex drive prop system can be created that is easily and 
temporarily lifted out of the water.  Compare to the Hobie flipper system. 
which is a trial to remove and replace.

To me anyway, and even under the best of conditions, props are so much more 
efficient, simpler and far less subject to breakdown.  Chasing the flipper 
concept is like trying to replicate sharkskin or whale fin tubercles. 
Nature simply does these better.

But have fun... but if Hobie couldn't do it...

Hello people!

Very interesting discussion here!
I'm brand new on this blog but I'm currently working on a pedal + propeller 
moved small wet submarine and have a couple of remarks/suggestions on this 
topic :
Good remark about variable torque (and RPM) when pedaling for actuating the 
propeller. Some inventors designed solutions to improve this : an "ovale" 
leading gear to compensate legs dead stroke and make the motion more regular 
and with a better efficiency already proven on traditional racing bikes (+10 
to +20% depending on promoted solutions : See http://osymetric.com)
An other way to damp this RPM variation is to adapt a rotation speed 
regulator and increase the angular inertia (it's mechanically very simple 
and cheap to implement). Only drawback : It's increasing a bit the overall 
weight and required some extra torque and time to speed up when starting 
motion.

Other question : I'm looking for a CFD software (such as Fluent+Gambit from 
Ansys or Flow-3D) else than the opensource ones, free but not always easy to 
use. Has anyone a clue about how to get an efficient and pro class one 
without spending a fortune (or downloading cracked, uncomplete, and of high 
risk of malware infection)?

Thanks

Hello Jimbo,

Boating in internet waters is fraught with the icebergs of 
misunderstandings, misperceptions, and misinterpretations. To attempt 
to dodge a few of these mis'es, let me state that my own interest in 
the fin drive discussion is almost completely curiosity-driven 
(sometimes a very inefficient drive-system itself ;-). I have no 
"dog-in-the-fight", particularly not the Mirage system, which has never 
appealed to me. Hobie or not, I don't accept that their drive is the 
be-all, end-all of fin systems. Of the systems I am aware of, only the 
Harry Bryan fin I mentioned caught my fancy at all, and I considered 
the yaw issue the greatest drawback, which was an entirely subjective 
objection on my part. It seemed to be a fly in the soup of what was 
otherwise the simple fish tail on-a-boat concept that intrigued me. 
Thus my question about a possibly yaw-balancing "split-fin drive"  ( no 
comments yet on this).

As regards the Bryan fin-system, specifically, I would submit that it 
is hardly more complex or subject to breakage than a prop system. (IF 
comparing them was the topic - see next to last sentence below)

As  tongue-in-cheek observation, I note that the Hobie effort , while 
solving the yaw issue, seems to me a fish trying to swim with its 
ventral fins as the main propulsors, rather than the tail. Other fish, 
smarter, I think, have chosen the tail as a better way to go.

I have watched Parker McReady on his Preposterous Pogofoil,  one of the 
earliest whale-tail creations and the horizontal fluke drive, at least 
in his hydrofoiling configuration,  was definitely a high-effort 
short-term proposition. Nothing relaxed about it.  Same goes for 
similar-but-simpler hydrofoil jumping-jack drive craft recently 
marketed (name escapes me at the moment.) Any horizontal fin "fluke" 
drive, introduces "vertical yaw"(pitching) which hurts efficiency also, 
of course.

Harry Bryan's simple displacement hull with a swish-tail fin flexing 
gracefully behind the boat much better suits my fantasy concept of a 
fin-craft for easy-does-it messing about. (Another marketing attempt, 
the Pacific Tail-fin, seems to have stalled, - the latest web-site 
update is dated 2006, I think. This is the "more bulky" unit I first 
mentioned, when compared with Harry's rig. Yaw is also evident in the 
site's videos.)

For elegant simplicity in a prop drive, Bob Stuart's drop-in Spin-Fin, 
which I have tried in his own kayak, very much impressed me, and if 
production/marketing considerations had been favorable enough that Bob 
had chosen to continue pursuing its development, I believe it would 
have become very popular. (More so than the larger Sea-Cycle units, 
IMO.)

(Relatively) recent progress in design and experimentation with 
flex-shaft propellor units, as exemplified by Rick's successes, with 
some collaboration by one or more others, I believe,  seem to me to 
represent the state of the prop-drive art at present, along with the 
interesting recent attempts at hp folding props. I also think the 
"kissing outrigger" stabilized monohull, again highly developed by 
Rick, Bob and others, has been adequately demonstrated to be the way to 
go for displacement speed.

In any case, I make no case for a fin's efficiency compared with a 
prop. Apples and oranges, I believe.  The trophy for ultimate speed, 
which I suppose is the highest measure of hp "efficiency" as we seem to 
be measuring things, seems still to be held by an air-prop driven 
hydrofoil (Decavitator) unless I am too far behind the times.

But the maximum-speed efficiency machines are not what I, at 70, am 
interested in spending my time on. Thus my intent in pursuing "fin 
discussion" is not to compare/compete with prop drives, but to explore 
fins as a separate subject.

I am slowing down, but still enjoy reading about and watching the 
experiments and progress achieved by all the human-power group, 
whatever their goals.  So I add my encouragements to all, whatever 
envelope they may be pushing. ;-)

Best wishes,

Larry

Thanks for the data on the Hobie drive.  I wouldn't have bothered  
thinking about fin drives if I had not seen a lot of room for  
improvement in all previous systems.

Starting from the fin, the usual scheme has been a rigid leading  
edge, with a flexible wing.  This gives a shape like an airplane wing  
flying upside down.  The first level of improvement is a rigid,  
symmetrical foil, as on an aerobatic aircraft, with a pivot that lets  
it automatically flip over to the best angle of attack for each  
stroke.  This pivot can have a second degree of freedom under manual  
control that lets it be set for reverse thrust.  For greater   
efficiency, we can use two wing spars, fore and aft, so that a  
flexible fin assumes nearly the ideal camber for each direction.

Next, the fins should be placed so that there is no yaw imposed on  
the boat.  The Hobie is fine in this respect, whereas Harry Bryan's  
boat was getting thrust from all three fins as it wiggled through the  
water.  Two fins off the stern with opposite motions are one  
solution, but I prefer having a compact arrangement, with the fins  
nearer the pedals.  Three options are: a single fin, with the side   
force reacted against the mass and shapes of a multihull, two opposed  
fins mounted like bilge keels or leeboards, or fins on the tips of  
sweeps, like oars on their way to being parked on the gunwales.
The single fin can be mechanically simple, with force in each  
direction coming from one pedal.  The bilge-keel mounting emulates  
the pectoral fins of whales and penguins, and avoids disturbing the  
surface of the water.  The leeboard style avoids a through-hull  
fitting and gives a longer sweep, but makes waves of it's own.  It  
might achieve a constructive interference with the hull, giving a bit  
of jet propulsion and suction at the hull end of the stroke.  Only  
the sweep mounting gives a really decent angle of attack, applying  
most of its force in the proper direction.  My propeller tips could  
move over 15' per pedal stroke (half rotation of cranks.)  However,  
sweeps need compliance and surface-followers to keep the fin working  
properly on most boats and sea conditions, and rigid parts to  
minimize hysteresis  losses.  They probably need an extra link to  
maintain a parallelogram to keep the fin angle accurate.  They might  
also want a compact-operation mode for use within a marina where oars  
are a clearance problem.

The single-fin type requires a separate rudder, but the others are  
able to handle steering duties.  The leeboard style would allow  
course corrections, or errors, depending on the listing of a single  
hull.  The double fin types, with reversing switches, would allow the  
boat to turn with no forward motion.  Various degrees of adjustment  
could be applied for course keeping, saving the drag of a rudder.   
Ideally, steering could be done by either varying the force on each  
leg, or, preferably, by touching the reversing switch or trim  
adjustment with the sides of the heels.

In shallow water, the fins could drag on the ground and still work,  
and when surfing onto a beach, they would dig in and resist the  
retreating wave.  They could also just swing back to shed weed if any  
drag built up.

One great advantage of pedal cranks is that they conserve momentum.   
Linear drives often waste energy by requiring muscle power for  
deceleration, like shadow boxing.  I have not tried it yet, but a  
system like the Hobie drive, but with the pivot at the top might work  
well, like a pendulum.  If the natural frequency works out to the  
right range, it could be a sweet deal, combining easily with the  
sweep or leeboard schemes for a neat, drop-in installation.  The mass  
of the whole system would affect the frequency.  It could probably  
benefit from springs for adjustment to different speeds or leg weights.

There are quite a few right angle gearbox manufactures.

You can use smaller boxes with 1:1 ratio and bicycle chain speed  
increase on the input.  Mitrpay range is probably the best value around:
http://www.mitrpak.com/product_results.php

Marcoplo boats are offering a modified Mitrpak box that accepts cranks:

http://marcopoloboats.com/MitrpakDrive.html

This box has a 1:2 ratio that is a bit low for a fast boat.  I prefer  
a minimum of 1:4.

You can purchase nice gearsets from this place:

http://www.qtcgears.com/RFQ/BevelGears.htm



I have used two Mitrpak boxes to make complete drive legs for a few  
applications now.  These are really nice but also end up expensive  
per the unit pictured here:

http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/folded_pedal_thruster.jpg

These units use a modified T-122 for the top box that accepts cranks  
and a standard R-101 on the bottom.  This gives an overall ratio of  
1:2, which is ideal for swinging the 30X20 prop with two units  
pushing the 8t sailing catamaran.

You can get 1:4 ratio using two of the Mitrpak boxes as seen here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXSZLt_6eFg&feature=related

You need to get to 6 minutes in before you see the top box.  The  
bottom box and prop are partially visible in the shots on the trailer  
at the beginning.

There are other ways to get the right angle drive including twisted  
chain, twisted belts, flexible shaft and magnets. Each method has  
pros and cons.

re you question:
Other question : I'm looking for a CFD software (such as Fluent 
+Gambit from
Ansys or Flow-3D) else than the opensource ones, free but not always  
easy to
use. Has anyone a clue about how to get an efficient and pro class one
without spending a fortune (or downloading cracked, uncomplete, and  
of high
risk of malware infection)?


I had a look at your sub.  I expect that you could get performance  
gains simply by working to minimise wetted surface and enclosed  
volume.  You can calculate the drag reasonably accurately for  
operating in deep water by using the ITTC57 skin friction line:
Cf = 0.075/(log10 (Re#)-2)2

The drag can then be approximated to:

Rv=1/2*rho*U2*S*Cf

Where U is speed and S is surface area both in compatible units with  
rho.

You need to do these calculation for the entire wetted surface  
including the fins and the prop protectors.  Each fin and protector  
should be treated as separate for determining its Re#. Remember to  
allow for both sides.

Further comments:
1. This simple analysis excludes form factors, which will be low  
unless you have some abrupt transition in section.  The optimum  
fineness ratio for water is around 8 but the main aim is to keep the  
volume and overall surface area as small as possible while having the  
room to operate.  Fineness of less than 4 would start to make form  
more significant.
2. If you are near the surface then there will be waves.  There is  
freely available thin ship software called Michlet that gives  
accurate wave data fore fineness down to around 5.  Michlet will also  
calculate the skin friction based on the ITTC line.
3. The ITTC friction calculation assumes turbulent flow over the  
surface. There are so-called laminar flow hulls that give favourable  
pressure profiles to maintain laminar flow but I doubt whether they  
can achieve this in a hull disturb by pedalling.  Some info on that  
here:
http://www.iag.uni-stuttgart.de/luftfahrzeugaerodynamik/paper/ 
melbourne_9_98_lutz.pdf

One area where you might gain efficiencies is to consider less  
turbulent methods of power input than cycling. I have done  
biomechanical modelling of swing arm system in air compared with  
cycling.  In the harmonic regime, up to moderate power, it is more  
efficient than cycling.  I tested that system on the boat seen here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYoW3XjHRbw
It is not suited to energetic power level and the harmonics are  
probably less beneficial when the legs are buoyant but it still  
offers lower velocity of the moving parts - predominantly legs.

I expect you would get reasonable drag results for your existing sub  
using this approach.

You should find there are more efficient ways to adjust pitch and  
roll using moveable ballast (or air) at low speed and fins for higher  
speed rather than the twin side thrusters.

Hello Rick,

Thank you for your recommandations and advices. Actually my CFD quest is not 
only for the submarine drag reduction and estimation aims but for more 
general questions such as sizing of the tail and interaction with hull and 
transcient analysis when pitching, yawling and rolling.

Your point about efficiency with an arm swinging system for propulsion is 
interesting but looking at the video on your weblink it seems that you are 
pedaling (with high speed results!) or did I miss something? Could you be 
more specific about this system please?

Thank you.
Bruno

You can get good results for foil modelling using JavaFoil or Xfoil.   
I prefer JavaFoil because it has friendlier front end:
http://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/jf_applet.htm
It is a 2-D analysis but it has corrections in the options page for  
the foil aspect ratio.  It gives good results for a wide range of  
sections that can be selected and modified if required.  You can  
simply add the drag components of each element.  You might get  
different results with full 3D CFD analysis but you could not rely on  
them anyhow.

For a foil mounted of a large flattish surface double the selected  
aspect to allow for the end plane.

The high velocity body element with pedalling is the feet.  If they  
are moving in a high density fluid such as water then there is a lot  
of wasted energy in stirring the water with the motion of the feet.  
With the swing arm system the power stroke is more effective.  The  
force is in line with the movement of the power stroke of each foot.   
For example if the thrust is applied in a horizontal direction then  
the feet mostly move back and forth horizontally with a small  
vertical lift at either end.  With a crank the feet travel both  
vertically and horizontally at the same velocity.  In a recumbent  
position the vertical component of the motion does not delivery much  
force to the cranks - per your observation for the elliptical  
cranks.  Hence the feet travel at high velocity for 4 quadrants of  
the cycle with roughly only 1 quadrant being effective power delivery  
or 75% of feet spinning energy just to make the next power stroke.   
With a swing arm system it is closer to 50% of feet moving energy to  
make the next power stroke.

In air there is the benefit of the harmonic motion if the swing arms  
are set up right so there is negligible cost in the reversal.  That  
may be more evident in this clip courtesy of now departed colleague  
Warren Loomis:

The reason I played around with this drive system on my V12 boat was  
to lower the centre of gravity of the engine such that it was  
compatible with unstabilised slender hull.  I have also contemplated  
its use on a faired trike for endurance record setting because it  
requires less volume than cranks and chainrings commonly used - hence  
lower wind resistance.  It is a compact arrangement for delivering  
power that still permits the HUFF configuration.   I have seen other  
configurations that try to reduce frontal area but they look  
incredibly awkward to operate.

Re: CFD

Hello Rick,

Thank you for your recommandations and advices. Actually my CFD quest  
is not
only for the submarine drag reduction and estimation aims but for more
general questions such as sizing of the tail and interaction with  
hull and
transcient analysis when pitching, yawling and rolling.

Your point about efficiency with an arm swinging system for  
propulsion is
interesting but looking at the video on your weblink it seems that  
you are
pedaling (with high speed results!) or did I miss something? Could  
you be
more specific about this system please?

Thank you.
Bruno

Greetings --

This mailing list "hpv-boats@bikelist.org" is moving to "hpv-boats@hupi.org".

The move will probably commence on Monday or Tuesday, depending on how
busy we are. When Alex (at bikelist.org) is ready, he will turn off
the list at bikelist.org so no new messages will be accepted there
(this includes commands such as subscribe/unsubscribe requests). Alex
will then send the list data to me and I will install it and
reactivate the list at hupi.org.

We're using the same software at both servers so in theory this should
be a simple move.

You don't have to do anything -- except start using the new address
after the move.
I will send another message when the list is running at hupi.org.

--
Brian Wilson
bwilson@hupi.org

Sorry, but if you're on more than one 'hpv' list you will be reading
this message more than once!

Terrific overview, Bob, ... thanks for taking the time!

Plenty of food for thought.

As a side observation (OT), your reference to "sea conditions" brought 
to mind a similar issue with one of my FrontRower rigs, where the 
changing freeboard with lighter/heavier loadings, and the varying 
surface height with chop, dictated differering "settings" of the 
mechanism, to insure proper oar-blade immersion. ( I built an 
adjustment feature which helps with the freeboard issue, ...somewhat 
less helpful with chop, but helps a bit.)

Your idea re. multihull yaw resistance interests me. Considering the 
added advantage of inherent stability(no outrigger drag at any speed or 
degree of list), and the overall desirability of a single fin's 
simplicity, do you believe that the lateral resistance of two hulls 
would effectively reduce the overall drag, yaw plus hulls, enough to 
equal-or-better that of a monohull with yaw-countering and stabilizing 
appendages? I envision hulls each optimized for its half of the total 
displacement at expected speeds, and an overall beam dictated by 
Godzilla(etc.) for minimum intra-hull wave interference.) My weight 
hovers around 200 pounds these days, so I generally think in terms of 
about 325-350 for all-up weight of a "pleasure" craft with lunch, 
camera, etc.)

I took pleasure in watching the relatively slow-turning 18" prop as Jon 
Knapp's Sea Saber moved away from the dock, which of course the rider 
could not see. There seemed to be a somewhat magical amount of forward 
motion from the prop activity.  I had a similar impression while 
watching the (8 ft.?) air prop on the (Steve Ball's?)Dragonfly 
hovercraft at (14-15mph? IHPVA Championships - Visalia Ca.) speed. I 
imagine similar pleasure from watching the fin working between the cat 
hulls, in this case perhaps visible to the rider, in a configuration 
which placed the fin closer beneath the pedals, minimizing linkages, 
etc.

Maybe a "Feathercraft" type kayak  drop-rudder(s) to assist turns, but 
raised for straight runs, minimizing appendage drag?

Jimbo,
Could you link-to or reference the source from which you took the quote 
re. Hobie efficiency? (i.e., the "definitive study")
Thanks.

I assume mine is not the only dropped-jaw about the knowledge (and

Hi Larry,

I'd have to get serious about the math to work out the relative  
efficiency of hulls vs fins at resisting the side force of a single  
fin drive.  At least, having it in between the center of resistance  
and center of gravity lengthwise should keep yaw to a minimum,  
although there would be some sideways wiggling.  Hobie-cat style V  
bottoms would do much better than minimum-resistance round bottoms,  
too.  With round bottoms, a foil-shaped skeg would take much of the  
load, and add a bit of thrust itself. The skeg might be all the way  
forward, to balance the side force provided by the rudder.

The Sea Saber was my first good HPB ride, and it did feel like magic  
once I centered the rudder.  High pitch numbers give a magic  
appearance, too, but they do add a lot more invisible spin to the  
wake than is ideal.  OTOH, they waste less power at the low-torque  
parts of the pedal cycle.

My recall was that the Dragonflier had a 10' prop, but I'd have to  
check.

There are two general approaches to the whole efficiency debate.  One  
is the sailor's definition of "A Race"- two boats within sight on  
approximately the same heading.  The other is from my friend Gary  
Marshall, regarding our kayaks - "But Bob, once I'm on the water, I'm  
THERE!"  That didn't stop him from spending weeks inventing a new  
rudder style, though.  Boats are what sculptors do to avoid art dealers.

Mark,

Marco Polo Boats has both a Mitrpak right angle gear box at a 1:2 =
increaser ratio made specifically for HPB, as well as a very flexible =
cable shaft that can bend 90 degrees over its length. Photos of the =
Mitrpak are on our website, and write if you would like photos of the =
cable shaft.

In addition, we are working on a redesign of our PlanetDrive with a 1:4 =
increaser ratio and 300 in-lbs of torque rating. The PlanetDrive will =
now be directly attached to Mitrpak drive for a total of 1:8 increaser =
ratio.

Rick Willoughby has tried the flex cable drive, and found it fine until =
11 kph, at which point it kicks back, but we are working on a solution =
to that. The cable shafts are not yet on the website =
(marcopoloboats.com), but they are 316 Stainless Steel and two meters =
long. The cost is $225 delivered in the U.S. Figure about another $50 =
for delivery outside of the U.S.

We will be working on website updates this week, but if you want more =
information, please contact us directly.

Thanks,

Mark Vermilion
Marco Polo Boats, Inc.

A while ago I decided to do a dynamic model of the crank drive and  
curved shaft system for a pedal boat.  This was so I could determine  
how a drive would feel before it was made rather than doing it by  
trial and error.

The model is able to produce time based data on the important  
parameters of a drive system.

This trace shows what my current 8mm curved shaft does with a 1:4  
ratio on V14 hull:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to4%20_solid.pdf
 From a feel perspective the black curve is the most important.  The  
closer it is to a straight line the better.  At 3m/s average boat  
speed the crank speed is varying between 60 and 80 rpm.

This is the trace with Mark's flex shaft:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to4%20_flex.pdf
For the average boat speed of 3m/s the crank speed is going from  
slight reversal up to 140rpm.  With 170mm cranks 140rpm corresponds  
with my maximum foot velocity so that was my speed limit with the  
flex shaft.  I have video that shows the stop-start nature of the  
pedaling so the model is reasonably close to reality.

I have also modeled what the flex shaft would be like with a 1:8  
ratio driving a 12X12 prop:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to8%20_flex.pdf
Here the crank speed variation is from 40rpm to 120rpm.  This would  
feel tolerable and I could get slightly faster than 3m/s before  
hitting my 140rpm limit.

So with higher gear ratio the flex shaft system looks to be an  
economic means of getting a right angle drive and mounting the prop  
within reach beside the hull.

Also with practice at spinning, the crank speed would be smoother.   
Even with the 1:4 ratio I could hold quite steady foot speed with the  
flex shaft up to about 8kph. I do not have enough training to "spin"  
as I load up.

The dynamics depends on the boat and prop as well as the shaft and  
gear ratio.  If anyone wants a shaft system modeled in this way it  
does not take long to do.

Thanks Rick
your report is highly informative and seems very accurate, as usual.
I'm just wondering about Mark Drela's flex shaft propulsion system, the one
he donated to The Open Waterbike Project

http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system

<http://www.openwaterbike.com/components/drive-units/mark-drela-drive-system>The
shaft is olid but pretty thin (just 3 mm !); nonetheless he says it was
builit and worked very well.
Do your calculations confirm this?

shaft is olid but pretty thin (just 3 mm !); nonetheless he says it was
builit and worked very well.
Do your calculations confirm this?

If they could have achieved the design performance in terms of drag  
then the 3mm shaft would be OK spinning at higher cadence than I am  
capable of now.

The biomechanical efficiency drops off above 300W with a 300mm pitch  
prop at 6m/s.  It is a slippery slope when drag is higher than design  
and would require a trained "spinner" to overcome the inherent losses  
of a compliant shaft.

I expect if they had taken the design further they would have  
increased the shaft diameter once they understood the problem.  From  
the videos I have seen of Skeeter in operation the pilot seems to be  
delivering a great deal more than the target 250W to get it to fly.   
Hence I would question the comment "worked very well".  My  
understanding is that it performed well short of design objective.

There are other ways to improve the efficiency such as more rotating  
inertia on the driving end of the shaft to provide carry through the  
dead spot.

The biomechanical efficiency is not an illusion.  I can drop my heart  
rate from say 140bpm to 137bpm for the same boat speed by  
concentrating on spinning rather than just pushing the pedals.  The  
problem for me  is it involves untrained muscles that tire quicker  
than the better trained ones. And this is using drive system with  
little compliance.  The benefit of spinning is even greater with a  
compliant shaft.  Spinning is about 10% more efficient than push-push  
on any crank drive.

Have just got one of Rick's folding props with shaft.
The shaft is 16mm aluminium solid rod 2m long,
and the flex section is 9mm epoxy reinforced flexible
steel rod. Had the idea if a flexible shaft can go up
and down to avoid snags why not move it side to side
to steer the boat. Tried it out this week and works well,
turns better than with the rudder I had. The shaft is at
an angle of 11deg so curve is quite shallow, even so
needs a bit of leverage to turn it. Have put a post in
the boat design website with some pics and a video.

I haven't been active on this list for years but recently got mixed up in an
effort to build a boat that will go around the world autonomously.

I remember figures on human wattage from this list along with other useful
numbers.  Can anyone recall the average sustained wattage and peak wattage
for a human?

Thanks Rick
your report is highly informative and seems very accurate, as usual.
I'm just wondering about Mark Drela's flex shaft propulsion system, the one
he donated to The Open Waterbike Project

Do your calculations confirm this?

As you know I believe the availability of a commercial flex-shaft propulsion

Thanks!


Its looks likes like 120wats is a sustainable figure.
  
Now I will attempt to convert meters/seconds to kilometers/hour to miles per
hour.  Yes I'm working with the unfortunate American scale.


The figure I'm most interested in is 

speed/watts sustained 

speed/watts in a sprint 


with a mono-hull design.

Don't know what you mean by autonomously, is it large enough for living 
quarters like the old microship projects.

Here's some old links that might be interesting along the same lines:

http://microship.com/microship/index.html

http://www.prophish.com/nyrio.html

Hope this helps.

The torque on the crank varies approximately sinusoidally because the  
model assumes the leg force is constant.  The sinusoid shape results  
from the effective lever length of the crank varying from zero at the  
dead spot up to the full crank length at the maximum torque.  This  
applied torque is the red trace that I call "leg drive" - it is  
mislabelled (N); it should be(Nm), being the crank torque.  Note that  
I do not force the sinusoidal motion - the shape of the curve is the  
result of the constant leg force and the effective lever length of  
the crank.  So the more the crank speed varies the more the shape of  
the curve departs from a true sinusoidal shape.

If there was no compliance in the shaft then the thrust curve would  
be a similar sinusoidal curve to the crank torque and it would be in  
phase.  The crank speed would be almost a straight line with a small  
amplitude sinusoidal wave impressed in phase with the crank.  When  
the shaft has compliance there is a lag between the crank torque and  
the thrust.

At the dead spot the shaft is completely unwound, or even wound in  
reverse due to the boat driving the crank.  After the deadspot the  
increasing torque, with little resistance from the shaft due toits   
unwound state, enables high crank speed to the point where the shaft  
gets wound up and starts accelerating the boat and slowing the crank  
speed.  In the curve you refer to the average crank speed is 71rpm  
but it overshoots to about 82rpm.  The slowing from 82rpm back to  
71rpm causes an increase in boat speed over the average.

There is an exchange of energy between the shaft spring energy and  
the boat momentum.  The frequency of this is a function of the boat  
mass and the shaft spring constant.  The more compliant the shaft  
then the greater the amount of energy transfer between shaft and boat  
momentum.  In fact if you look at the second chart I linked to with  
the very compliant shaft then you can see there is some variation in  
the boat speed:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Boat_Shaft_1to4%20_flex.pdf
This is similar to the sort of speed variation that you would see in  
a rowing shell that has momentum transfer from body to boat and  
thrust variation due to the stroking of the oars.

If you replaced your steel shaft with an aluminium shaft of same  
diameter you will have enough compliance to reduce your biomechanical  
efficiency and the dynamics will be more apparent.  A good shaft will  
have similar feel to a bike on the road i.e. very well connected  
rather than rubbery.

Rick



Hi Rick
On your dynamic model of crank drive for the V14 hull with 1.4 gear  
ratio:-
The thrust curve has a major dip just after the peak, what causes  
this as
there is not a similar dip in the leg drive.

An update on the pedal thrusters for Peccadillo.

The big catamaran won the Three Peaks Race this year:
http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/25/3199840.htm

The win was due primarily to sailing ability.  They managed a  
slightly faster trip using the thrusters when the wind died in the  
Derwent River on the final sailing leg.

There is a good photo of the cat with thrusters mounted at the start  
of the race here (image can be enlarged):
http://www.sail-world.com/UK/Australian-Three-Peaks-Race-2011-starts- 
off-at-a-cracking-pace/82737
The drive legs are folded up with the big prop on the back of the  
seat.  The thrusters were secured in this place for the whole race.

Charles said that during the pre race testing and up the Derwent two  
pedalers could hold 2.4 to to 2.5kts working on 30 minute rotation.   
The other boats could hold about 1.5 knots using oars.

Has anyone tried using a automotive fan belt to change the direction of pow=
er transfer 90 degrees.
=A0That is to say go from pedals to gear then at gear use the fan belt to c=
hange the direction of power 90 degrees to the propeller by twisting/turnin=
g the fan belt the 90 degrees over some distance like a few feet.
=A0Or possibly from the pedals to the propeller, I like the idea of going t=
o some gears so that it might be possible to increase propeller rotation si=
gnificantly while keeping cadence at a pace I can more easily manage.

Mark
         Problem I see with using a fan belt is the
slippage. When tensioned enough to stop the
belt from slipping as the prop spins the friction=20
losses would be very high. That is most of your
effort goes into turning the cranks and not a lot
of that power turning the prop. Belts such as the
timimg belts used in cars may be a better alternative
as they would give a positive grip without a lot
of friction to overcome.

Mark
As Ian pointed out the typical V-belt will have poor efficiency for a  
pedal drive.

I have used toothed belts and they can be set up nip idlers to have  
very low losses.

Nauticraft go a step further using a toothed belt in a twisted  
configuration.  It feels nice and seems reliable.  THere is a sketch  
in this brochure:
http://www.nauticraft.com/downloads/ 
escapade_pedal_boat_brochure_9_2008.pdf


Has anyone tried using a automotive fan belt to change the direction  
of power transfer 90 degrees.
  That is to say go from pedals to gear then at gear use the fan belt  
to change the direction of power 90 degrees
to the propeller by twisting/turning the fan belt the 90 degrees over  
some distance like a few feet.
  Or possibly from the pedals to the propeller, I like the idea of  
going to some gears so that it might be
possible to increase propeller rotation significantly while keeping  
cadence at a pace I can more easily manage.

Hi Rick and the rest of the list,



First of all I=92d like to thank you for your huge contribution to human
powered boating.  I=92ve followed your threads around the Internet and it=
=92s
been a great inspiration.



I=92m starting on my pedal-powered build, using a fiberglass surf ski as th=
e
foundation.  I picked up a T-gearbox at 2:1, and plan to start with the APC
16x16 prop, a 5/16=94 steel flex shaft, and chain gearing.  As has been
mentioned, finding spring steel in the US is not easy.  Doing some research
on the Internet, this is what I=92ve come up with and I=92d appreciate your
input:



A search for spring steel yields several grades of steel, including 1095:
http://www.tmtco.com/products/spring-steel.html



Trying to find 1095 steel, I see that it is equivalent to W1 drill rod:
http://forums.dfoggknives.com/index.php?showtopic=3D6783



Can=92t find W1 drill rod in anything longer than 3=92, but I see that A2 d=
rill
rod is similar: http://www.onlinemetals.com/toolsteelguide.cfm



A2 drill rod is available in 6=92 length and fairly cheap:

Alternatively, flexible sewer rod is available:
http://www.flexmax.com/maxlife/cat1.html (MDA-72LC, powder coated) $41
shipped



I=92m not sure of the material properties of the sewer rod, but it is nice
that it comes powder coated.  Here is some data on A2 drill rod:

The sewer rod is probably the better selection.  I have seen these  
rods in use and suspect they are spring steel but am not certain of  
this.  The end fittings are similar to what I have done with spring  
steel although with  5/16" diameter you do not need to be fancy if  
the connection is not seeing the bending stress.  Irrespective these  
end fittings give you something to work with for connecting to prop  
and gearbox.  So that is added value.  I have paid $60 for a single  
connector before I started making my own.

Assuming they are spring steel then you should aim to arrange with at  
least 3.5m radius curve.  For the 1.8m length you can drop 0.5m.  The  
prop shaft will need to be around 250mm below the surface so the  
gearbox cannot be any higher than 250mm above the surface.  This  
should be easily achievable with a surf ski.  The output shaft on the  
gearbox will angle down at 30 degrees.  If you can get the gearbox  
closer to the water then that is even better.  Obviously the down  
angle of the shaft will reduce in this case.

The surfski should be a good platform.  I have modelled an Epic V10  
hull to check performance and they are a slick hull.  If you have  
something similar it will go well.  You will not operate it reliably  
without stabilisers - CoG will be too high.  For smooth water  
operation you can have stabilisers mid mounted.  If you want to  
operate in waves then mount them toward the stern to reduce flop  
roll.  Use two not one.  They need to be long and slender with a  
volume at least 15 litres.

The 5/16" shaft with 16X16 prop will have very good feel - similar to  
riding a bike.  With the 1:2 box you will need around 1:3.5 in the  
chain.  This is a nice ratio as you can use mountain bike stuff.    
You can side mount the prop so it can be reached for cleaning.  The  
shaft strut will need to be stiff enough to prevent the prop from  
hitting the hull when you turn.

 From a practical use point of view, weight is really critical.  You  
should make an estimate of weight.  Count every nut and washer.  Make  
allowance for paint.  You should target 20kg or less.

As a matter of interest Mike Lampi launched his V15-6m last weekend:
http://hpb-er.blogspot.com/
He has some minor issues to sort but it went well for first time out.

I plan to give my V15-6m its first run this weekend.

Rick:

Thanks for the link to Mike Lampi's boat, very interesting. I noticed Mike 
is working on some steering issues.

Ian from Oz land (I57) has developed a way to steer by using a lever system 
to move the flex shaft sideways. Seems to work a lot better than the 
different rudder systems he has tried on his boat. Prophish also used a

      The directional prop has its uses, it only works

with a flexible shaft. The setup is heavier than with

a rudder or dipping rudders, the steering arm has

to be strong and the steering lever is longer as it

takes more effort to push the shaft side to side.

The advantages are doing minor course changes

without the rudder being turned which slows you

down. Also for manouvering at low speed it works

well. The boat has a bigger turning radius but if I

lean into the turn and dig in the outrigger I can turn

a bit tighter.

     Another way to overcome the torsional stiffness
in flexible shafts is to use a combination of directional
prop steering and dipping rudders. To keep a boat=20
tracking straight only requires minor movement of the
steering arm, this small amount should not overstress
the flexible shaft. For a tight turn the dipping rudders
could be used. Another way is to fit angled rudders at
a set angle on the aft end of the outriggers, they would
be set just above the waterline. By leaning into the side
you want to turn the rudder digs in and turns the boat.
Simple but effective, would need a bit of reserve of=20
volume in the outriggers. In rough water could be a problem
with waves hitting the rudders.
Having said all this I'll now have to fit them on my boat
and see how well they really do work, should be
interesting. Have to wear my wetsuit on the first trial.

I'll leave it to each individual, how important "tight turns" are in  
his activity, remembering that we are talking pleasure/race  
watercraft, not fighter planes ;-)

*Note - I'm aware that my "dismissal" of mechanism design/ 
construction issues in the following discussion makes my observations  
"easy for me to say", while actualizing the concepts would be  
anything-but easy!

But let's at least have some fun with theory:

Trying to look at basic principles, it seems as though there is some  
potential for aft outrigger-mounted rudders to be the most effective  
of all, if satisfactory mounting/deployment can be devised.

If we assume that an asymmetrical (lifts better in one direction)  
rudder can be more efficient in it's preferred direction-of-lift than  
a symmetrical (can lift either way) rudder lifting the same way,
... and that any rudder drag offset in  the direction of turn at some  
distance from the hull adds to the turning effect, while rudder drag  
centered behind the hull impedes the boats forward motion, but does  
nothing to help turn the hull, ... and that, if the sterns of the  
outriggers are even with the stern of the hull, and the center of  
lateral resistance of the hull is some distance forward, then the  
straight line distance between the center-mounted rudder to the CLR,  
i.e., the effective lever arm with which the rudder effect is  
working, is shorter than the diagonal line from the outboard rudder  
to the CLR.

Then we see that the outboard mounted rudder has 3 advantages,  
compared with the center mounted rudder, i.e.:

Center-mounted aft symmetrical foil rudder = less efficient either- 
direction turning (lift) effect/ non-contributing drag/ turning force  
applied to a shorter lever-arm..

Outboard-mounted aft asymmetrical foil rudder = more efficient  
specialized one-way turning effect/ turn-enhancing drag/ both applied  
at a longer lever-arm.

Another consideration: Leaning into the turn, and thus immersing the  
outrigger hull to what ever depth, adds "drag" turning effect, but  
not all of it at the aft lever-arm point, and without any additional  
foil-effect turning force. Experiment would determine if the loss of  
hull speed from the additional drag is favorably offset  by reduced  
turning radius ( I imagine a rodeo "barrel race" type of comparison,  
down-to and around a mark, back to start, around and repeat, to timed  
finish at start/finish point).

It would seem more "ideal", ignoring difficulty of design/ 
construction, if the hull could be kept more upright during the turn,  
the outrigger hull NOT immersed, and the appropriate Reynolds-number  
asymmetrical foil deployed "dagger-board-style" at its best lift/drag  
ratio angle of attack, only deeply enough(variable) to give the  
desired turning rate.

Thus we would have the best lift/drag turning force applied at the  
best (long lever-arm) position, to only the degree desired, with both  
the foil lift and the inescapable accompanying drag contributing to  
the turn.

The twin (smaller)outboard rudders and linkages might end up weighing  
little if any more than the larger center-mount rudder. (better  
efficiency / better applied might make up for size disparity (lift/ 
drag ratios and points of application of the force being the  
determinants).

If the twin set-up weighs a bit more, anyone who is seemingly willing  
to carry 30-40 lbs. excess personhood constantly, such as myself,  
should probably not complain about the rudders ;-).

Re. "Reserve volume" in outriggers -   personal opinion only, but  
seems to me that an outrigger which will not prevent overturning,  
once  fully immersed, with any normally expected leaning by the  
operator, is inadequate in the first place.

Comment/criticism welcome, naturally. :-)

I had my latest boat in the water for the first time yesterday.
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/v15-6m.png

It was a windy day that was not ideal for the first run.  It did  
prove it is a very dry boat.

The new carbon shaft feels well connected to the prop.  My home built  
1:4 gearbox is also a winner.

I was rushed to get to the water so have not yet measured final  
weight but it is easy to carry complete - the stabilisers fold up for  
transport.  I also want to measure the torsional compliance of the  
shaft.

I am still not quite happy with the shape of the bow from side  
windage; something to work on for the next one.  I have also worked  
out how to build it with fewer panels.

       New boat looks good, see what you can crank
it up to when the weather improves. How much load
can the gearbox take, is it on a par with the involute?
       Always the way when you build a new boat, you
see ways it could be improved upon when finished.
Windage on the side with small boats like these is
always a problem. Hope to see it soon.

It was a miserable day and I spent a good deal of time waiting for  
Dean to set up his boat.  He then got about 100m and a pin in his new  
gearbox failed.  It was a crappy spring pin that the machinists  
fitted after fitting the crank shaft. His latest box is a well made  
two speed hand drill with a double gear set.  Very nice gears but  
only bushes for bearings - also very light.  He has still not yet got  
around to fitting the Involute box he bought from me.

The gears in my home made box are larger than the set in the involute  
box.  So the gears will take probably take higher loads but my case  
is not as rigid so it might flex more.  I think I would twist the  
shaft before the gears brake.  It felt very smooth and ran quietly.   
The weather was not conducive to sprinting and my fitness level is  
more consistent with building boats than racing them right now.

You could also save a bit of weight using a carbon fibre shaft but I  
will work out any easy way to wind them and how much the carbon will  
cost.

The weather is looking good for next Saturday.   By then the paint  
will even be cured.

Rick,

Thanks for the info, I ended up ordering the sewer rod.  Almost ready to
start building it.

I'm not sure how my surfski compares to the Epic V10, it's an older Valhalla
Victory I think.  You're right about the need for stabilizers; I had a tough
time keeping it upright while paddling in calm water.

That weight target will be a challenge, I estimate the boat weighs 16 kg
as-is.  Is the foremost issue transportability?

Thanks for the link to Mike Lampi's build, maybe I can learn something about
laying fiberglass there.

Dom

The main issue with weight is transport.  Life is so much easier when  
you can carry the complete boat.  The 16kg is probably right for an  
older style surfski.  Does not leave you much to play with.  I doubt  
you will get under 20kg!

It actually is worthwhile taking the time to plan out what you intend  
to use to build it.

Target weight for stabilisers is 1kg each.  I have used 100gsm cloth  
on 3mm Klegecell foam.  If wood, 3-ply is ample.  Be careful with  
fairing and painting.  They hardly ever touch the water so finish is  
only related to looks not performance.

A seat can weigh as little as 300g.  An aluminium frame taped up with  
glass, no more than 2kg.  Need to be mindful of the load paths.   
There is high force between backside and cranks.  There is also high  
force on the tension side of the chain.  The prop thrust is  
relatively small compared with the crank forces and chain force.   
Having frame located to most directly resolve the forces will help  
keep weight down.

You can use some parts of the frame for multiple purposes.  The  
support for the back of the seat can double as a mounting point for  
the prop shaft strut if you have the shaft side mounted.  If you make  
a separate seat then the part of the frame that the seat bottom is  
mounted to can act as grab handle for bracing against, mounting the  
frame to the hull and provide a place to insert the stabiliser beam.

A little gearbox is around 1kg.

Tried out the outrigger steering method today, it did turn tighter. I =
mounted

the asymmetric outriggers the opposite way with the flat side outboard =
and

the curved side inboard. The rudders were rigidly fixed to the aft end =
of  the

outriggers, 100mm deep x 150mm long set at 30 deg. Leaning into the turn

I could only immerse the rudder about 10-15mm, if I had leaned any =
further

I might have gone for a swim. The main turning force came from the shape =
of

the outrigger, the rudder had little effect. The rudders were set 50mm =
above

the waterline, any lower and they would have been causing drag from the =
waves.

With the directional prop hard over and leaning into the turn it is the =
best I've

had out of this boat. Tried turning using the outriggers only keeping =
the prop

running straight and the boat was very slow to turn, seemed better to =
port than

starboard. This may have something to do with the prop rotation.

It might work better with better designed outriggers but the main =
turning force

came from the directional prop.

The following links show progress on a couple of new pedal boats  
under development.

This one is a video of a Melbourne local with his second pedal boat:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB13MWTbCuo
  It is made from the hulls of his first boat, originally a small  
sailing catamaran.  He cut the original hulls such that he could use  
the ends of one hull and the centre of the other to make a single 5m  
long slender hull.  He cut down the sides of the hulls to reduce  
weight but the freeboard is now very low.

This is Cory Shaffhausen's blog giving some good detail on his second  
boat he is now building:
http://pedalplusboat.blogspot.com/
Cory has made modifications to the V15-6m design based on recent  
learning with Mike's and mine plus incorporating his own requirements.

       He was really flying in the V7, just leaned
a bit too far the wrong way.
      Make sure no one puts it on funniest home videos!

I completed a new boat in time for the Murray Marathon but family  
concerns prevented participation.

I have posted some pictures here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V15_58.htm

I have only had the boat out a few times and have already got it  
going faster than any other.  Top speed so far is 19kph and I expect  
I will get a bit more.

I am still battling to get weight below 20kg.  This one came out at  
21.5kg.  I will need to vacuum bag the hull to get lower.

Best wishes to all for 2012.

Happy new year to all.

Rick, is that a hand drill gearbox being used in V15 or something else you 
found? Looks a lot more compact and lightweight than some of your previous 
models.

Here is a reference to graphene, a very new possibly stronger and lighter 
material that I thought you might find interesting. It is already available 
in powder form and can aparently be tweaked for marine applications:
http://www.plastemart.com/Plastic-Technical-Article.asp?LiteratureID=1433&Paper=graphene-automotive-aerospace-wind%20energy-electronics

Might be a way for a lighter hull down the road a bit...

Cheers,

Vic

Happy new year to all.

Rick, is that a hand drill gearbox being used in V15 or something  
else you
found? Looks a lot more compact and lightweight than some of your  
previous
models.

Here is a reference to graphene, a very new possibly stronger and  
lighter
material that I thought you might find interesting. It is already  
available
in powder form and can aparently be tweaked for marine applications:
http://www.plastemart.com/Plastic-Technical-Article.asp? 
LiteratureID=1433&Paper=graphene-automotive-aerospace-wind%20energy- 
electronics

Might be a way for a lighter hull down the road a bit...

Cheers,

I have a couple of these boxes and have used them before.  They are  
designated DZ2.  They have similar rating to an R-082 Mitrpak box but  
have slightly thicker shaft.  They weigh 1kg.

With my present method of construction I have been adding more than  
1kg in fairing the hull.  If I were to vacuum bag over a male mould  
with a silicone bag I will get fairer finish.  It would save a lot of  
effort and reduce weight.

As it is the boat is quite easy to carry with stabilisers attached.   
They fold up over the seat once the brace is unclipped. This is how I  
transport the boat.

This boat now looks good enough such that some people actually ask  
"Where did I buy it?" rather than asking "Did you make it?".  So some  
progress on the finish but still not commercial quality.

There is a fellow who has seen Mike racing his V15 boat who has  
approached me about making a plastic version with a view to  
commercial production.  It is early days yet but will see how it  
progresses.

I have gone back to the side mounted prop for a variety of reasons.   
The instigator was a semi-professional cyclist, Matt Johnson, from  
Seattle who has built a V15 style hull 6.5m long with the original  
intention of bettering the 24 hour record.  I have since convinced  
Matt that he should join Mike in the Sound Rowers races.  Matt can  
sustain around 330W, which is around 3 times what I can hold and  
about twice what Mike can hold.  In looking at the drive train I  
found I could not come up with a suitable shaft design for aft  
mounted prop for this power level  so went back to the side mount  
design for him.  It prompted me to use that set up on the new boat  
and he can now copy what I have done.  I will probably supply a prop  
and maybe shaft.  Also Mike still gets a bit of bother clearing weed  
from his folding prop and that is simply not an issue with a prop you  
can reach by hand and clean if it is badly fouled.

The reason I can get higher speed from this boat is the low torsional  
compliance of the drive train.  I am spinning a lower pitch prop at  
7X cadence.  The prop is on an 8mm diameter spring steel shaft that  
is only 1.4m long.  The drive dynamics are much improved over my  
V15-6m boat with the aft mounted prop on the CF shaft.

The CF shaft with aft mounted prop has worked very well but it is so  
long and at 4X cadence spinning a high pitch prop the torsional  
compliance is noticeable above 14kph.  It eventually limits top speed  
due to shaft recoil at the crank deadspot.  Mike Lampi is limited to  
about 8mph due to his shaft dynamics so he cannot do the high speed  
sprint to the finish line he could do in the Cadence despite his V15  
boat being faster over the course.

I did a lot of drive analysis for a guy, Dave Giering, who eventually  
wound his own CF shaft.  He has a very heavy boat but is pleased with  
his new shaft.  So CF shafts are a good way to go but they need to be  
purpose made to have bending compliance but torsional stiffness.

Hello.  Hello,  out there.  Is anybody there?  Is anybody doing anything
worth reporting?  Or is my receiving faulty?  I have not gotten anything
for months (years?).  Just for the record, Nauticraft is still here; we
had a reasonably good year considering the economy and hope to have a
better one here in 2012.  Well, anyway, a Happy New Year to everyone!

Didn't you get a flurry of activity from Rick Willoughby recently?  I  
have not had my own keel wet in six years.  I realized that my boat  
work was probably not building a sustainable, useful technology, and  
lost interest.  HPBs appeal to simplicity, while metal and water  
demand complexity.  I'm still interested in the possibility of fin  
drives, made from carved wood and rope.  A high-tech version could be  
as fast as a propeller.

Hi Bob, Curt, All,

I'm still linked and receiving the rare contribution, but have been =
inactive for quite awhile myself.

At 71, diminishing years and energy have found me putting my =
boat-thoughts/efforts into somewhat larger sail/powered craft, but I'm =
still appreciative of the efforts of Rick and others who are pushing HPB =
envelopes.

I wish the main body of discussion had not so completely moved to other =
venues, but maybe the increased level of technology and required =
mathematical and computer literacy made that inevitable.

Part of the fun for me was leaning against a figurative tree watching =
the early "back-yard" inventors fumble forward. I've learned a lot, but =
improving my knowledge was a low bar, compared to  getting to the level =
of today's fore-fronters.

Bob, ever since Harry Bryan's first fin-drive showed up, the graceful =
swishing of a fin drive and the natural looking magic of a boat moving =
under "fish power" has intrigued me.

Slow moving/turning parts with surprising resulting movement are =
fascinating to me. (In my mind, I still carry the image of my first =
sight of Knapp's Sea Saber pulling smoothly away with its relatively =
slow-turning 18"(or so) prop.

I would like to see the result of extended, concerted efforts by such a =
community as used to exist on this site, directed toward a =
state-of-the-art fin set-up.

I used to think some split-fin arrangement might best answer the yaw =
issue, with the fins sweeping opposite directions at a given time (think =
swim fins on a diver swimming on his side).

I also imagined a forward turning rudder-fin actuated in phase with the =
(single) fin's stroke to "lift" the bow to the appropriate side to =
counter the fin's yaw force. Additional drag, of course, but a fixed =
forward fin also has drag, but offers less correcting "lift" due to =
restricted angle of attack, no?

Anyway, tossing ideas into the midst of this group has always been fun. =
:-)

Very nice to hear you are still out there Bob!  "High tech" wood and =
rope. I like it!=20

Best wishes and Happy New Year to all,

Larry

Hello everyone(again!),

Just a quick note of apology for redundancy.

After typing my last, I visited some of the HPB archives here:
http://www.mail-archive.com/hpv-boats@bikelist.org/msg00434.html

...and found that almost all that I posted today was part of a previous =
discussion about a year ago.

I claim age related CRS as my excuse.

Fun to read the older back-and-forth anyway. ;-)

Leaping Lizards, Larry.

I'm not quite sure what you were describing, but suddenly I'm  
wondering about a fin that moves vertically, instead of having to  
react against another fin.  With the right linkage, the legs could  
tilt it for steering, or run it in short strokes for shallow draft.

A lot of fin drives use flex to accommodate changes in direction, but  
that usually gives the foil the opposite camber to what you want.   
Rigid fins on a hinge with limited motion are an improvement, like  
the symmetrical wing sections of an aerobatic aircraft.  However, it  
is possible to get beneficial camber by using spars fore and aft,  
with a flexible material in between.

Hi Bob,

Well, if we're talkin' mammal drive rather than fish drive, I suppose =
we've traded yaw issues for pitch issues ;-).

 I picture Parker McCready's Preposterous Pogofoil, and I imagine myself =
preferring the wake of the swishing back-and-forth tail, over the =
(turbulent?) commotion behind the up and downer.

I always find your input excellent thought food. Great to hear from you =
again!

Larry

Hey Bob and Larry,

=20

That's better!  It's great to hear ideas being batted around again.
Some of us (I'm talking about myself here) never had much to add to the
group but that doesn't mean  we weren't interested in what the rest of
you creative guys were thinking and doing.  I hope it keeps going on.
And on.

Dennis
Having spent considerable time now with both systems I agree the side  
mounted prop offers practical benefits and significant performance  
benefits over aft mounted.

Even the offset thrust can be managed very easily by a bit of  
tweaking.  There is also a less evident benefit if the prop is spun  
in the direction such that the prop torque offsets the weight of the  
gearbox.  The boat trims out nicely.

On the third time out I got over 20kph.  I am now close to being  
power constrained rather than limited by footspeed and shaft  
compliance.  The gear ratio is 1:7 enabling me to reduce prop pitch  
which lowers prop torque, hence the amount of wind-up in the shaft.    
The dynamics of this latest drive system will be hard to better.


Did you do any boat modifications before last summer?



That is a great looking boat with a very impressive performance.
I am please to see that you have reverted back to the side drive bent  
shaft system. This type of drive, I feel is
the most practical for launching and retrieving with out a trailer  
plus it can be serviced while still
afloat.

Hi Rick

At the electric boat race, a photo was taken from the rear of my boat & =
I decided that the wake was excessive so modified the square stern to a =
point.  This greatly reduced the wake but did not appear to improve the =
speed which is what you had predicted.
Additionally I completed several tests on propeller tip shapes & =
concluded that a simple HOEANER tip was a improvement over the radius =
ends that you have been using, additionally it is very simple to make.
The tips were raked outwards at 30 degrees with a radius where the =
leading edge meets the tip.
I also tried tiplets (look similar to winglets) & found the performance =
similar to the rake tips but as these were tried on fully shaped =
propeller blades I dropped the idea due to the high amount of work =
required.

Ian Cassell was out on the lake with me on Saturday and took some  
video of my new boat:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQs6YgO93RY&feature=g- 
upl&context=G2845651AUAAAAAAAAAA

The video provides some observations of the ruder working,  the trim  
of the boat and flow on the bow.

Hey, all,
 
 
Might be able to spina few yarns here and there. One or two might involve  
Hydrobowl races  in Midwest. We have been doing them, tho they have been a  
little quiter. There are a few new boats and players, and I have been trying 
out  new components . Maybe a boat or two on the horizon.
 
 happy New Year

I now have a mould for making CF folding blades:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/CF_Prop_Blades.jpg

The resulting propeller has a diameter of 330mm and weighs 160g.  I  
have tested the blades to 16kph, which corresponds to 65N thrust.   
This is more than twice the thrust needed to achieve 12kph, which is  
the sustainable speed for a pilot in good shape.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONk3fUnHamI

The pitch was close to what I calculated below 12kph but it is  
possible there is some blade flexing due to loading because the pitch  
was apparently reducing as I increased speed.  Usually the speed to  
cadence increases as speed increases due to reduced slip.

The prop is suited to a gear ratio of between 6 to 8 depending on the  
boat and pilot although the boat needs to be easily driven.  I was  
running at 7X.

I could get 5kph in reverse spinning flat out.

The blades do not deploy as quickly as heavier blades.  I plan to use  
a stainless steel core to add some more weight and possibly reduce  
blade flexing.

Overall I am pleased at how the blades worked out.  It only takes a  
few minutes to lay up the blades but overnight to cure.  Hub is the  
same nylon rod I have used for stainless folding props for the last  
couple of years.

I plan to do durability testing over the next few months.

       How much of a weight difference is there
between the CF blades and steel ones?
Do you provide a slot in the hub for the shaft
or do you leave it blank. Being a nylon hub
it wouldn't be hard to drill.

The normal stainless blades weigh 70g.  Remember this is quite a  
small prop.  The CF blades currently have an aluminium core and weigh  
20g.  The core is needed for twist strength as I am only using  
unidirectional fibre lengthwise on the blade to resist bending.

The next ones I mould will have a stainless steel strip for the  
core.   This will add a bit of weight and should help deployment as  
well as stiffness against twisting.

There is much less effort in making these blades compared with  
grinding stainless steel.

I was surprised how easy it is to get a perfect blade from the  
mould.  The mould cost a bit but it is well made and virtually  
guarantees a good result.  The mould maker had not used CF for  
reinforcing before so it was an experiment for him as well.  He has  
made a mould for a larger fibreglass prop used for wind turbine and  
thousands of others moulds but mine is tiny by comparison with these.

Rick:

Great looking prop, thanks for posting.

Have you reached perfection with this prop, so it can be used with your 
other boats as well? Or is a dedicated prop for your racing machine? If you 
can go to mass production, perhaps others would be interested in a 
purchase....

Thanks,

Vic

This prop is close to optimum for the side-mounted configuration on  
the V15 boat or any similar easily driven boat.   It suits a gear  
ratio around 7X .  It could be used on slightly heavier boats as well.

I have already supplied a prop to another boat and prepared to make  
them for sale if they suit the application subject to them  
demonstrating the required durability.

I was wondering what ever happened with this boat.  I saw pics of it
quite awhile back and thought that it would make for a pretty quick
boat as it was using a surf ski hull.  It looks like it was moving
right along in the video.

Dennis
The last few seconds of the video has some detail on the boat - it is  
an OC1 with two outriggers rather than 1.  This has the advantage  
that the boat is balanced so the outriggers can be unloaded and just  
surface skim.  A normal OC1 will give away about 3 minutes in an hour  
compared with this configuration.

OC1 hulls are a little narrower than surfski because they do not need  
inherent stability in the one hull.  However a normal OC1 is slower  
than a surfski due to greater windage and the extra drag from the  
loaded outrigger.

Clive has now fitted a Bolly boat prop. The original  was a lower  
pitch model aircraft prop.

There are photos of the original set up here:
http://www.humanpoweredboats.com/Photos/Individuals/PedalWaa/ 
PedalWaa.htm

Until recently I thought the Pedal Wa'a and Harry Howard's Pedalos  
were the same boat but Clive explains that the drive was supplied by  
Harry Howard.  On inspection the cockpit of Pedalos is quite different:

Tom,
sorry, here's that link
http://youtu.be/Rdph3VOyPbU

Rick,
thanks for that info!
I'm a bit confused about the Harry Howard's Pedalos, his test mule,
and then the catamaran that went from NY to Brazil (I think).  And why
his record braking boat hasn't been offered to the general public but
the plastic boat is.

The pedalwaa has an interesting drive for the prop, but I'm not sure
if that method is for me.   I still like what you got going on the
best so far, at least for my boat's design.

And not to get too far off topic, but I've also been looking more into
the proas and what you said in your emails.  Richard Woods suggested
using a kayak for the outrigger hull which is very interesting so now
I'm trying to come up with a way of adapting a pedal prop drive to the
proa.  Main hull or outrigger/kayak hull?

Yeah, I know, I got two different boat designs going on at the same
time now.  I like how both are going, and yeah both are different and
so I see myself pretty busy with both of them!

for those just tuning in, I got a folding biplane rigged catamarn for
one design that I've been working on for awhile now, but recently have
go fascinated with proas, both boats are being designed to complete
the 1200 mile Ultimate Florida Challenge (which is presently in
progress with only 5 boats left and one about to drop out.)

After years of messing about in pedal kayaks, I decided that what I  
really wanted was a much narrower main hull with one outrigger.  That  
gave less wetted area, and having the drive leg beside the main hull  
made it easy to swing up for beaching or weed removal, etc.  while  
also keeping the drag and thrust lines close together.  The ama gave  
the option of carrying a passenger without ruining the trim, camping  
on the tramp, or sailing, with water ballast on one tack.  The open  
cockpit is self-bailing except for the footwell, which can have a  
speed bailer.  I have the hulls for this built, 20' and 12' long, and  
most of the hardware for a SpinFin with S cranks on one side, but  
have no time to finish it now.  Interested?

Matt Johnson contacted me in August 2011 regarding a pedal boat  
design suited to his weight and power output.  He finally got it on  
the water today and posted this video:
http://youtu.be/IL5GBgJbS_4
Matt is the most powerful engine I have done a design for to date so  
it will be interesting to follow progress.  He is aiming to join Mike  
Lampi in the Sound Rowers races when his time permits.

The resulting hull design is based on my V15 series but optimised for  
110kg displacement and 300W power.  Hull ended up 6.5m long.  Matt  
chose skin on frame as his method of construction along with a  
separate tubular frame and commercial recumbent seat that mounts to  
the basic boat.  The drive is configured with side-mounted curved  
shaft spinning at 7X cadence.

I provided a hub for folding prop and the second set of moulded CF  
blades for testing.

The test was impressive but brief because the folding CF blades  
snapped when he accelerated for the second run.

That boat of Matt's really flys, he really
accelerated away fast. Wonder what
speed he got up to. When he has used
it a few times he should be ready to set
a few records. The rudder caused a bit
of turbulence but that is a minor problem.
Hope his boat can stand up to the power
he can put into it.

Ian
He pushed up over 13kph easily but said he realised he has some  
conditioning to work on by the time he got to the other side of the  
lake.  The design speed is 4m/s or 14.4kph.  He should get to that  
with 270W .  When he was bike racing he was working in the high  
300s.  No doubt it will be interesting to follow progress.

I suggested he nurse the blades by staying below 16kph until he had  
worked out what needed changing or setting up better.  I forget to  
tell him not to accelerate hard.  Blades broke the second time he  
took off to do a pass for the camera.  I have tested the new blades  
to static load of 120N, which is 50% higher than I was prepared to  
take the first set.  New layup should be able to take my full power  
so will do some flat out sprints with my next set.

Matt will fabricate a set of stainless blades while he is waiting for  
my improved CF set.  It would be a shame if the blade strength  
limited his acceleration.

I went out with Ian C yesterday to do some filming of his new boat at  
launch.  It was windy with average of 25kts and gusts to 35kts so  
filming from my boat was bouncy.  The results are posted on Youtube:

Ian made some slight changes to the design and is using the in-line  
shaft arrangement with his 1:3.3 Involute made box with curved shaft  
all used on previous boat. The boat performed well and he was pleased  
with the way the wave piercing foredeck worked.

Hi All

I have given up on pedaling in the recumbent position, bikes and boats, 
due to lower back pain which gets worse every time I try.

As a result, I plan to sell my Yamaha Lakerunner.

Does anyone have an idea what a Lakerunner, in good condition, is worth 
and also, where is a good place to advertise it?

I put it on craigslist but I suspect the audience may be too small to 
attract the right buyer.

Thank you in advance form a long time lurker.

Take care
--

Steve:

You know what you paid, but I would expect a huge bid - ask range on an item 
like this because of such a small following in the USA. Perhaps consignment 
at a shop that sells Hobie & other pedal types, or take to sell at a kinetic 
sculpture race in your state, Ventura or Eureka?

Mike Lampi has started posting some of his race clips to YouTube.

There are 4 clips for the Jetty Island race he did this month.

First shows him moving from dock:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dlCe2m_Bp0&feature=youtube_gdata

Next shows some warm up near the start:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uGCtH5TNo0&feature=youtube_gdata

Then the start - he is on the nearside of the course taking photos:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td5FOAUuk_E&feature=youtube_gdata

Then the finish - he comes in just before the 8 minute mark but  
camera has trouble focusing:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMEZFycXD4Y&feature=youtube_gdata

Ian Cassell has also started to post to YouTube:

       The link for my YouTube didn't work,
try this one.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DL8BaIr44zPg
Otherwise type in the search  V15-I_calm_Water.

As we are all seperated by distance or continents
this could be a good way of getting a look at
everyones boats, post a clip of their boat in or
out of the water.

Fred Pluimers has posted a video clip of his Stand Up Paddleboard in  
operation:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDsH-970dwQ

The board is made by Hobie and the frame I supplied but was  
subsequently modified to better fit the board.  The comprises a DZ22  
gearbox, 1/4" spring steel shaft and prop with folding blades.

The board hits its wave hump between 7 and 8kph.  A pilot with good  
power to weight might be able to get it to plane.

The Aquaskipper looks pretty cool, but I can't imagine being in that bent over position for very long. If those guys have to assume that position, where would a 6'4" bear like myself be? 

But to scavenge parts from it and go from there, well, that would be sweet. 

What is the nature of the drive train and propeller. I did not see any pictures of the actual pedal foil mechanism.

Andreas Sch=F6nw=E4lder released a preliminary report on the Computational
Fluid Dynamics simulation of waveless hull, the centerpiece of the Open
WaveWaterbike Project, a radical research project aimed at designing and
building a very short high efficiency pedal boat.
The report is available here:

Rowing Boat for big water.

Boat looks good, a scaled down version I think
could be easily fitted out as a pedal boat. Wonder
why the outriggers hang so far out the back?

Clem
I have replied four times to a specific email from you but I gather  
you are not getting them.  You need to see why your email service is  
not allowing them through.

This was in a previous email.

My CF props suit boats that are more easily driven than the Waterbike  
catamaran.  I have given Beppe performance prediction with them and  
their efficiency is only 78% on the catamaran because the hulls are  
quite draggy compared with a single hull.  There is some reduction in  
drag by avoiding the leg in the water when using the curved shaft.   
The other benefit is that the folding prop easily sheds weed compared  
with a fixed blade.  He said that some of the places they use the  
boat there are weeds so that can be a significant benefit in those  
circumstances.

Cory recently put one of my folding props on his boat and provided  
some photos:

Mike Lampi has continued to tune up his boat.  He is gradually  
lifting average speed:

X-List-Received-Date: Thu, 25 Oct 2012 21:56:50 -0000

I went up to Echuca for the Murray Mini on the weekend.  It is a 50km  
race that covers about 2/3 of Day 3 in the full Marathon.  It was a  
good opportunity for Peter Heal to try V15-6m as he is contemplating  
doing the full race at the end of the year.

In 2010 Pete set the unassisted round Australia cycling record  
covering 15,000km in 49 days - meaning he is a fair cyclist and a  
specialist with recumbents.

I set up his boat as well as I could from measurements and data he  
provided.  He found the settings OK but the gearing was heavier than  
he preferred.  I selected my stainless steel folding from V14 prop  
for him on a 1/4" spring steel shaft.  This has done two MMs so I  
know it can take the bumps.  However prop pitch is 620mm so there is  
a good deal of compliance with the 1/4" inch shaft.  RMS power is  
about 5% higher than average due to torsional compliance.   I used  
one of the folding CF props - it only had one small knock in the race  
and is unscathed.

There were 33 boats in the Mini.  Some were in relays but majority  
were single or doubles.  There were two OC6s.  Pete's official  
average was 13.8km.  Mine was 11.2kph.  Current assist averaged  
around 1.8kph.  I have only started getting fit for the MM.  Also the  
seat cushion on V15-58 also caused me some aggravation.

The link to the old records is dead at present but I think Pete's  
average would be at record pace for unrestricted over 50yo in the  
full Marathon - his speed would go up to 16kph on handicap.  The full  
marathon is a handicap event with age allowance and boat allowance  
although unrestricted boat class has a time penalty against the K1s.   
Last weekend there were only two single paddlers faster than Pete but  
they are 30 years younger.

I have posted a photo showing the two boats in the starting area:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/slide2.jpg

Race results are here:

On Sunday there was a short race up and down river at Echuca - Steam  
v Sweat; where we raced a paddle steamer on the downriver leg from  
the start.  There were also runners on the shore.  This was the first  
year boats were involved and it was good fun.  Pete beat the paddle  
steamer to the turning buoy.  I rode its wake till we had to turn to  
come back upriver - speed drop of 3 to 4kph over the ground when  
pushing against the current. Results for the 8km race here:

Pete did have his "Spot" on the boat for the mini but updates are too  
slow to be of any use with the amount of meandering but gives general  
direction:

The first boat of my V16 pedal boat design variant is being built in  
Maine, USA.

As well as being the first V16 hull that uses the 32 parameter  
Michlet shape function for optimisation, it is also the first to be  
built in a female mould.

The mould was made from low cost melamine coated particle board using  
a slightly curved board for the bottom and two boards flared up from  
the bottom to form the sides.  The mould is simple to make as it  
comprises just three flat panels with stiffeners.

The shape is drag minimised for 120kg total displacement with a  
heayweight pilot and sustainable power output of 120W resulting in a  
hull length of 6.4m.

The shell made in the mould using glass/foam/epoxy composite and  
vacuum bagged during cure weighs 6kg and is near perfect finish over  
most of the area:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/img_3967.jpeg

The finished hull with bulkheads and deck panels should be under 10kg.

The mould was made from low cost melamine coated particle board using a
slightly curved board for the bottom and two boards flared up from the
bottom to form the sides.  The mould is simple to make as it comprises =
just
three flat panels with stiffeners.

The shape is drag minimised for 120kg total displacement with a =
heayweight
pilot and sustainable power output of 120W resulting in a hull length of
6.4m.

The shell made in the mould using glass/foam/epoxy composite and vacuum
bagged during cure weighs 6kg and is near perfect finish over most of =
the
area:

The finished hull with bulkheads and deck panels should be under 10kg.

The first of my V16 series design has been built in Maine over the past =
15 months and was launched this week. =20

There are photos linked here:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V16-64_Bow.jpg
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/V16_64_Side.jpg
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Folding_Prop.png

The V16 hull shape is more complex than the V15 series, having variable =
side flare, which reduces drag slightly.

The boat has been fitted with a Gates Carbon Drive belt to eliminate =
problem of chain corrosion.

The boat uses one of my commercially produced folding props with =
stainless blades.

Boat is 6.4m long with design displacement of 130kg.  Actual boat weight =
is 24kg.  The main hull is 11kg of that.

Made a community page on facebook for pedal powered boats.
Its for letting people see what you are doing with your boat such
as cruising, racing, fishing or whatever. There are plenty of sites
covering design and building. Have a look and see what you think
any feedback would be great.

I'm looking forward to hear/seeing how this new craft performs!  Especially
the belt drive and your new commercially available folding prop.  How do I
find out more about the prop?

Dennis
The prop used on this boat was the test prop sent to me from the =
manufacturer and then forwarded to Maine.  It performs almost the same =
as the folding props with carbon fibre blades I have been supplying to a =
few of the V15 users.  It requires a gear ratio up around 6X to 7X =
cadence.  It suits easily driven hulls.

I am waiting on a production batch that I expect before the end opt =
August.  At this stage I am selling them for AUD100 plus mail.  You can =
email me if you want me to assess the suitability of prop for your =
proposed application.

The stainless blades carry a bit more momentum than the CF blades so it =
might be possible to get a higher speed with them despite the extra =
weight of 330grams versus 160grams.  I have pushed to 19.2kph with the =
CF on my V15-58 boat but did not have the right conditions for a speed =
test when I did the initial run using the production prop.  Stainless =
was my preference as these blades are strong and will not bruise or =
break easily.    Shinny blades do attract fish so I have had some fish =
strikes with my first folding prop using stainless blades.  Over time =
the blades dull so fish strike, if an issue, does diminish as the blades =
age.

During its maiden test the V16-64 cruised easily at 6mph with the 66yo =
builder/pilot.  He could do 8mph working above his aerobic limit but he =
did not try a flat out sprint.  The Gates drive worked well although the =
maximum ratio available is 1:3.  With his 1:2 DZ box to give 6X overall =
he found the gearing a bit low and plans to fit a stainless chain to try =
7X.  If that suits him better I plan to advise how to re-pitch the prop =
so he can go back to the Gates belt drive.

I will update on the new boat as I get information.

To help the V16-64 builder set up his stabilisers I took some video =
following Ian Cassell around on the local lake this week.  It was a calm =
day and a good opportunity to show well set-up stabilisers. =20
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DF5nMkikOM88
When set correctly the stabilisers should sit above the trough of the =
divergent wave off the bow of the main hull with their aft end just =
kissing the crest of the wave.  Ian's are in the ideal groove between 9 =
and 10kph.

Rick

=85=85...
I'm looking forward to hear/seeing how this new craft performs!  =
Especially
the belt drive and your new commercially available folding prop.  How do =
I
find out more about the prop?

Does anyone still monitor this forum?

The MR 340 is intended to start at 7am on Tuesday 12 August.

There are two propeller driven pedal boats competing in the human =
powered section and a stabilised monohull competing in the electric =
power division.

Some details posted here on the two pedal boats:
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pedal-Powered-Boats/307740326036595

The electric boat is being painted today so it will not be tested before =
the race.  This link is a render of the boat:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/SE8.png
It is based on a two person pedal boat platform with electrics replacing =
one of the pilots.  This link shows 8m long main hull before fitout:

Bob
I am a reluctant Facebook user.  Also am a regular user of Google so =
gets heaps of targeted advertising.  New Australian laws will require =
ISPs to maintain all connection records for at least two years.  Big =
brother is here.

So here are the photos on my web site.

Greg's modified CP2; now heavier but stronger:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/cp2.jpg

This is Scott Reeves' Third Wheel on the water:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Third_Wheel_on_water.jpg
This is it on transport to get a better idea what 9m looks like:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/Third_Wheel_on_Car.jpg

Third Wheel is 9m long with design displacement of 320kg.  It has three =
seats one is for rest and recovery.  Aim is to have two working engines =
in reasonable condition for the entire 340 miles.

Both drives on Third Wheel use a T10 industrial toothed belt inside a =
crank mast with the gearbox offset from that.  This is a view inside the =
mast:
http://www.rickwill.bigpondhosting.com/T10_Belt.jpg
This arrangement has significant advantage over a chain or belt =
cantilevered from the overhanging shaft.  With the pulleys mounted =
between the bearings the shaft flex does not cause misalignment.   The =
nip point roller you see allows the belt to run without pre-tension.  =
Really smooth, low maintenance, quiet, belt enclosed and clean.

Andreas Husi also recently launched his converted rowing shell.  It has =
the same crank mast design.  This was taken after it was painted up:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DkXyHNHgv6v4#t=3D13
This one was the first water test:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DQg8fdbw6_e8

About a two month ago Fred Pluimers launched his V16-65 round chine =
boat.  The main hull is in three parts for easy transport and storing =
with a 3.2m long centre section and two end sections:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DffOKZDAkEac
Fred is still using the drive design similar to what I had on the V7 =
boat that he purchased some years ago now.

I am listening and viewing also, still trying to learn... maybe from
a different perspective, but I love to see the various creations, and  impre=
ssed by the designs and ingenuity.

Thanks,

Thanks for stirring things up Rick, a few more have looked at the facebook =
page.
I realize not everyone is on facebook but it is a good medium to see what p=
eople
are doing with their boats. 
I posted here when I started the facebook page, when you are logged into fa=
cebook
put in Pedal Powered Boats in the search. The links Rick has put up will he=
lp if you
can=E2=80=99t find it. 
People are reluctant to go on facebook but you only need to put the bare am=
ount up
to log on, you don=E2=80=99t even need a photo. Use hotmail or gmail.

The roller is on the slack side of the smaller pulley.  The top driving =
pulley is less inclined to slip due to number of teeth in contact and =
the increased angle of wrap.

I expect there would be some interested followers on the Facebook page =
for your race results and reports.

Ian started the page mainly to cover what people were actually doing =
with their pedal boats.

Reluctantly I am shutting down these lists soon.
The pipermail archives will remain online indefinitely.

hpv
hpv-forsale
hpv-boats
trikes
velomobile
vph

If someone wants to port any of them to another place I can provide you
with the subscriber list. Write to me directly if you want information.

Message volume is so low that I don't think it's worth the effort to move
them again.
