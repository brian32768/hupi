Subject: [hpv-forsale] WTB: short cranks in SC
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP38096755F9A225D347B9E7ED820@phx.gbl>

I am temporarily in SC (winter warm-up), and just had a chance to get 
myself a trike.... <<TerraTrike Path 3>> now I NEED some short cranks...
taper square BB, 140mm or 152mm arms, single, double or triple rings... 
need 1 of the rings to be 40 to 48 tooth range.

If I can't find something soon, it will have to wait til I get home.

We planned on keeping this around as a loaner but with all of the review bikes we have coming up, it's become painfully obvious that I don't have room to do that. So I'm selling our test trike for $800. Like new condition other than one pencil eraser sized dent from shipping. Retails for $1200 with the options I have on it.
