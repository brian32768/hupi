Message-ID: <CA+4TE0GFe2xn-eEWdDaT2R2ti-DS6sEhnDroAyMT=k99RdjKgA@mail.gmail.com>

Pair of schwalbe stelvio tires, 26x1.10.

High performance 26" tires, low rolling resistance, very supple and grippy.

Pair is as new, both still have the center ridge on the tread from the mold
at the factory. A bit dusty as they've been sitting a bit, but still in
perfect condition. I don't think I ever even mounted or rode these.

$60 for the pair, I'll throw in shipping. Paypal or money order accepted,
but you cover the paypal fees.

Please reply off list with any interest.

Hi -- I'm selling my Zox dual 26" front-wheel drive recumbent. I bought
this from Nick Hein in 2007(?) ; Nick bought it from Bill Volk, who was
original owner.  I actually haven't ridden it much at all in the last few
years, so time to move it on. Fast and comfortable, able to handle a wide
variety of road surfaces.  Best for taller folks (5'10+).  This bike has a
lot of miles, so a little rough around the edges, but it's also been
well-tended to.  I'd like to get $1000 for it.
See attached pic.
Thanks, JF.

Oops: the Truckit is a delta trike, the ELF is the tadpole ...
