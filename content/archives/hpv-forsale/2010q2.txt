Hi Joel,

That is a VERY large chainring!
Unless you have a 16" or 20"  nominal diameter drive wheel, it might be 
a bit difficult to use on a normal bike/trike. As an athletic rider I 
have a Challenge Hurricane (20" (406mm) wheels) with 60 tooth and 56 
tooth front rings, and an 11-38 9 speed group in the back. I love the 
gear/speed range it gives me. I couldn't really imagine pushing that 20" 
wheel and keeping a comfortable cadence with an extra 13 teeth unless I 
was on a flat with a strong tailwind or going at lest slightly downhill.

The only other thing that comes to mind is the length of your front 
derailleur cage, as it may not be able to easily make jumps between 
smaller rings and that big ring, nor may the post that holds it be long 
enough to accommodate the combined derailleur and chainring height.

best of luck, I'd like to know if you put it to use!

-andy

Given as a donation to Operation Comfort (www.operationcomfort.org) for 
use by wounded veterans. Not used much since the wounded warriors prefer 
something a bit sportier. OC is selling this to finance other purchases.

Standard equipment, 21 speed derailer gearing, dual rear disk brakes, 
front rim brake with parking brake. This is the not the HD model rated 
for 400 pounds, but can likely handle riders a little over 300 pounds. 
This is also a good platform for an e-motor.

Some surface rust on front brake noodle and the heads of some bolts, but 
it shifts, brakes, and rolls just fine. Paint is in good condition and 
there is no evidence of frame rust, just on the cheaper external 
fittings. We can replace or clean all rusty fitting for $20.

This probably won't be the cheapest trike to ship, but it could likely 
go into two fairly cubic boxes and ship for around $80-90, depending on 
distance.

2008 Sun Tomahawk, $595 plus shipping

For photos, please see:
http://www.easystreetrecumbents.com/used__bikes/TOMAHAWK.html

Standard parts including SRAM SX4 shifters and RD, Shimano FD, Avid 
Single Digit 3 rear brake, Avid FR-5 levers, and a Tektro U-brake that 
you can replace for $15 extra (it isn't very strong). Maximum 
recommended rider weight is 225#.

Seat and grips are in good conditions. Sun's seat isn't 
super-lightweight, but it is quite comfortable with its adjustable 
lumbar support and thick base cushion. If you like the seat on your EZ-1 
or EZ-Sport and want something lighter, this is a good choice.

3x8 gearing with 700C drive wheel for high speeds. 406 front wheel 
offers a wide variety of tire choices. Handlebar riser has adjustable 
tilt with a locking pivot and a wide range of height adjustment, 
allowing for a wide range of rider size and seat recline.

Accessories include Greenfield kickstand, 2x Mirrycle mirrors, HB water 
bottle cage, and springer rear rack.

I want to use same size tires front and back on my old EZ-1, so I need a TE
front fork.

I just put my last spare 16x1 3/8 tire on the EZ-1, so this would be a good

Are you sure a Sun EZ Sport fork wouldn't work better?

Seems like people _used_ to be able to use EZ Sport forks. Sun may  
still have something in stock?

Message-ID: <73BA6FA4-5661-4B2A-BB1A-8BCB859D4CBF@sonic.net>

Novatec is a major Taiwanese hub manufacturer both selling hubs under  
their own name and making them for other brands.

I have one slightly used Novatec A141SB 24-hole front hub for  
standard 100 mm dropout spacing. It is black and has cartridge  
bearings. It came from a wheel that came on a RANS F5. Here is a link:

I am selling this hub for $20 plus postage.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] Spinner 406 mm suspension fork
Message-ID: <35B012E4-4D19-4D4D-A98C-17B2FA927138@sonic.net>

This fork came on my 2010 HP Velotechnik Grasshopper FX and I rode it  
for 294 kilometres in dry weather before upgrading to another fork.  
It is in nearly new condition. This Spinner Grind2 suspension fork is  
designed for 406 mm wheels and has fittings for both V-Brakes and a  
disc brake. It also has a fitting on the bridge for mounting a  
mudguard. It has a steel coil spring and MCU elastomers, 45 mm of  
suspension travel, an external pre-load adjuster and a 1" x 157 mm  
threadless steerer tube with star nut installed.

HP Velotechnik sells the Spinner Grind2 fork for $219 plus shipping.  
I'm selling this fork for $150 plus shipping. E-mail me at the  
address in my signature if you'd like to purchase this fork.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] Magura Marta disc brakes
Message-ID: <0899F56E-A6E8-4180-95AC-1A0A5B0BC543@sonic.net>

In 2003 I bought two new sets of Magura Marta disc brakes. These were  
among the lightest weight disc brakes available at the time and are  
still lighter than most disc brakes currently on the market. I bought  
them for a project bike I never ended up going through with. I don't  
currently have a use for them and am trying to consolidate my brake  
collection to one shelf so am offering these for sale.

One brake has a right lever and the other has a left lever. Both have  
black levers and calipers with 160 mm International Standard 6-bolt  
rotors. Both calipers are of the International Standard 51 mm hole  
spacing direct mount type. Both are new in boxes.

I am selling them for $150 each plus shipping if they need to be  
shipped. E-mail me at the address in my signature below to arrange  
purchase.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] HP Velotechnik Speedmachine
Message-ID: <C211B213-9C8D-42BA-B759-754CAC88941D@sonic.net>

I am selling my 2008 HP Velotechnik Speedmachine demo bike. This bike  
has only been ridden brief test rides on dry streets around my shop  
and is being sold as a new bike with full warranty. It has never been  
crashed or dropped and looks new.

It has the following options (with 2010 prices shown after options):
Speedmachine complete bike, silver, aerobars (OSS U-bar type  
steering) $2690
BodyLink seat
Standard rear spring (for rider weight up to 100 kg)
Standard Marathon Racer 40 mm tyres
Concept front suspension with standard spring for riders up to 100 kg  
$439
Shimano XT 27-speed drivetrain $249
155 mm cranks $35
Avid BB7 disc brakes $199
Total $3612 plus shipping and duty

Further information and specifications on the Speedmachine can be  
found here:
http://hpvelotechnik.com/produkte/spm/index_e.html

I am selling this Speedmachine for $2700 plus shipping.

So you save $912 over the cost of a 2010 Speedmachine for essentially  
the same bike with the same components.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] Bebop pedals and cleats for sale
Message-ID: <759330DE-FA7D-4395-BF85-43487401A8C6@sonic.net>

I recently received a shipment of Bebop pedals and cleats from VP  
Components (who made them for Bebop for years and now sell them under  
their own name). The pedals come with cleats and cleat mounting  
hardware. Replacement cleats come with mounting hardware.

The Bebop pedals are available in three versions.
The BBP-11 has black coated CrMo spindles, weighs 210 g/pair and  
costs $95
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp? 
btn=2&cat1=2&cat2=11&pid=11

The BBP-01 has silver stainless steel spindles, weighs 195 g/pair and  
costs $150
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp? 
btn=2&cat1=2&cat2=11&pid=10

The BBP-21 has gold titanium spindles, weighs 150g/pair and costs $350
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp? 
btn=2&cat1=2&cat2=11&pid=9

A set of replacement cleats with hardware are $40.
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp? 
btn=2&cat1=2&cat2=12&pid=12

I've been using Bebop pedals since they first became available in  
1996 and typically get a bit over 15,000 km out of a set of cleats.

The prices do not include postage if they need to be shipped. Like  
with all the bicycle components and accessories I sell, if you see  
them advertised for a lower price I can match that price.

 Build details at http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/Teubner/orangeII.htm

I decided to build a really good vehicle for self-supported touring.  I just
finished a 5-day 350 mile self-supported tour and decided that I don't care
for touring.  The bike was excellent, but my body wore out and my attitude
was bad.  Rode for 2 hours in the rain one day, and none of the cargo got
wet.  Ran 17 mph into a headwind for the last 5 miles to home at the end of
a 91 mile day.  This trike works well.  Fly into GFK, stay in our guest
room, ride it for a few days to decide if you really want it, and I will
either haul you back to GFK, or you can ride it home.  Or drive up and get
it; 56751.  It will fit in a minivan with the back seats out.  Price is
$3000 if you want to negotiate, $1500 if you don't.  teubner at wiktel dot

Update:  I am 5"10" with a 43" X-seam and wear size 43-44 Shimano SPD
sandals.  I'm not certain how much adjustment there is in the bike, but I
would expect 41-44 X-seam but not much larger shoes.
