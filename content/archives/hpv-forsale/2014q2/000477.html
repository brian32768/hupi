<PRE>Highly prefer a local LA cash sale. Bought in 1999 for $2148. Extremely low
mileage as I was never able to make the European trip I hoped to take it
on. Was sent to Bike Friday in 2010 to be completely tuned up for sale and
was packed away in its Carlton until just a week ago when I reassembled it.

There is some wear on the paint and decals due to having to use heavy chain
locks in a high theft area.

I still have the manual, case, marketing materials that came with it, and
the VHS video showing how to break it down or build it up out of its
locking Carlton hardshell suitcase. While the spec sheet mentions a
computer mount, I'm not sure I ever had it. I've never moved anything from
out of the case, though, so I can look and see.

manual, etc. So I can fill in some of the tech info (I'm not a component

understand it!:
