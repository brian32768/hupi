Recumbent -- Easy Racer Gold Rush.  Purchased new from ANGLETECH in 1997.  This is a great bike.  Constantly ridden and maintained each year.  It has some chipped paint and is obviously not new.  Front Wheel is a 37 x 451 Carbon Composite  Aerospoke.  The rear wheel is a Rolf Vector Pro.  Front Crankset is 52/42/30.  Rear cassette 11/32. Will include a usable but not pretty Zipper front fairing with attachment hardware.  $1200.  At this price it cannot be duplicated.  It is truly a deal.

Message-ID: <D34BFD89-6E90-42B8-ACDE-969A5E54759D@bentrideronline.com>

Unexpected bills mean it's time to part with some bikes. I love this Mach 2 (It's actually my second one) but I gotta let it go. Due to the deluge of test bikes I've had this summer, I've only gotten a chance to ride it a few times so it's in pristine shape. SRAM X-7 components. Narrowed RANS Chopper bar. Bontrager rear wheel. Truvativ crankset. TerraCycle idler. Great bike. You can see what I thought of my FIRST Mach 2 (the bike for sale here has much better components) here. Actual bike is pictured below. AD says that this one would run about $900 retail with all of the options. I'd like to get $700 but make an offer! Email bryan at bentrideronline.com with any questions.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] RANS Seavo tandem for sale
Message-ID: <3C253842-CEDC-4C94-9040-426E7B093256@sonic.net>

2009 RANS Seavo tandem, yellow, non-S&S coupled version. This has been ridden as a demo bike and has only 829.6 kilometres on the odometer (514.4 miles). It looks new, has never been sold so and is being offered as a new bike with new bike warranty. This bike has the following upgrades over a stock Seavo shown here: http://rans.com/seavo

Deleted the stock 170 mm cranks and installed da Vinci 150 mm cranks on Tange alloy cup bottom brackets as the 170 mm cranks on a previous Seavo I had were ill suited to this bike design since they resulted in massive heel to front wheel interference on tight turns and the stocker's heels scraping the ground when cornering. The 150 mm cranks solve these problems plus make for smoother spinning, are easier on the knees allow running the handlebars lower and slightly reduce frontal area. I run 150-155 mm cranks on all my personal bikes and have long legs. The daVinci tandem crankset has daVinci 34T timing rings and Sugino 44/32/22 drive rings. If for some reason you want to use longer cranks, I can remove the da Vinci cranks and Tange bottom brackets for a cost reduction or change them out for the cranks and bottom brackets of your choice.

Replaced the much too wide RANS handlebars with Bacchetta handlebars which are also lighter. These are the same handlebars used on the Bacchetta Giro, not the narrower ones used on the Corsa and CA 2.0. I actually initially tried the narrower version of the Bacchetta handlebars and found them too narrow on tight turns as the front wheel has to be turned more on low speed turns on the tandem due to its much longer wheelbase.

Replaced the too tall RANS steering riser tube with a Bacchetta riser tube which brings the handlebars down to a more ergonomic position less in the line of sight yet still has plenty of leg clearance. Also saves weight.

Deleted rear V-Brake as the dual 203 mm Avid BB7 brakes offer plenty of braking power and heat dissipation area and I don't like the idea of the stoker having a brake as the stock setup has.

Replaced the heavy SRAM 11-32 cassette with a lighter weight and better shifting Shimano XT 11-32 cassette.

Replaced the grey Avid Speed Dial 7 brake levers with black SRAM 9.0 brake levers to cosmetically match the black handlebars and for a slight weight savings.

Replaced the stock thick seat pads with RANS thin seat covers with integrated foam to save weight, make it easier to put the feet down and reduce the leg angle to the pedals for increased comfort and pedaling efficiency for short stokers. I can swap back one or both pads for the stock pads at no extra cost. Here is a link for the thin pad: http://www.shoprans.com/proddetail.asp?prod=BPST0133

Replaced wide carbon fibre stoker seat base with a narrower RANS Zephyr carbon fibre seat base to reduce leg to seat base rub for shorter stokers.

Added CatEye Strada Wireless cyclecomputer cleanly installed behind the top of the steering riser where it doesn't add any frontal area or get in the way.

New the stock Seavo is $6575. The price on this one is $4895 if picked up locally. I'd prefer not to ship it but do have the original wooden shipping box which is too large for UPS so it has to be transported by some sort of trucking company.
