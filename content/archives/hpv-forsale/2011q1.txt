Message-ID: <3AE73362-5E41-4782-9D9A-7BC3F30B53B8@sonic.net>

Two more chainrings sold, this is the revised list.

I have the following elliptical or non-round chainrings for sale. All are aluminium with a silver finish. These are an inexpensive (compared to Q-Rings) way to experiment with non-round chainrings. They are listed in order from smallest to largest bolt circle diameter and within those categories lowest to highest number of teeth.

74 mm bolt circle diameter:

Climb Control 22T x 74 mm BCD (only uses 3 bolts, and only fits holes on 36T Climb Control rings), 1 used $10

Climb Control 22T x 74 mm BCD (only uses 3 bolts, and only fits holes on 36T Climb Control rings, 2 very used $3

Climb Control 24T x 74 mm BCD (only uses 3 bolts, requires removable spacers on cranks), 3 slightly used $20 each

110 mm bolt circle diameter:

Climb Control 36T x 110 mm BCD, 2 used $15 each

Climb Control 36T x 110 mm BCD, 4 very used $5 each

Sugino Cycloid 38T x 110 mm BCD, 10 new $20 each

Sugino Cycloid 40T x 110 mm BCD, 1 new $20

Climb Control 46T x 110 mm BCD, 2 used $20 each

Sugino Cycloid 48T x 110 mm BCD, 9 new $25 each

I am looking to buy a P-38 suspension fork for a customer who damaged his.  You can either respond to this email or call me at the shop.  If you have one lying around and want to get rid of it here is your chance.  Any color will do as we are repainting the bike.

Message-ID: <8DDC62B5-EC07-4F7C-A312-57FF3090C687@sonic.net>

I am selling a pair of Velomax Victoria 571 mm (650c) clincher wheels. The front wheel has 18 spokes and the rear wheel has 20 spokes. These wheels are super light, I weighed the front one at 546 g and the rear at 764 g for a total of 1310 g. The rear hub is compatible with Shimano or SRAM 8,9 and 10-speed cassettes. These wheels are in excellent condition. I only used them on special events in dry weather. Includes never installed Velomax quick releases. Does not include cassette, tyres, tubes or rim strips.

Here are links to photos of the wheels:

Subject: [hpv-forsale] Trice Q, wide track,
	26" hardtail and 20" rear suspended, $1900
Message-ID: <4D42D1F5.2080802@easystreetrecumbents.com>

Includes all parts for both the rear suspended 20" wheel, with Trice 
custom 9-32 tooth cassette, and hardtail 26". We will set up this trike 
either way before shipping to you. Conversion is pretty easy. This is 
about $3500 worth of trike once you figure in all costs. We can ship it 
most places for less than $100, disassembled.

The ICE Q is now called the Sprint, now built them in Taiwan. This trike 
is one of the last to be built in-house in Cornwall. This is the wide 
31.5" track version for extra stability when cornering.

This trike has 3400 miles on it but still looks new. No scratches, no 
dings. The black 20" suspended rear section has a wet glossy look that 
the photo does little justice to.

Parts include XT rear derailer, SRAM X9 front derailer, Schwalbe Durano 
front tires, Kojak 20" rear or Schwalbe Big Apple 26" rear. 
Sturmey-Archer drum brake front hubs (less abrupt, more user-friendly 
stopping than disks). 152mm Trice front cranks with Rotor Q-Rings 
22-32-44 triple set. Foam seat cushion insert from Trice. Chain is in OK 
shape, but should be replaced before major riding.

Some parts shown will not transfer. The 650C rear wheel will be 
retained, as will the pedals, Cateye computer, and one of the bottle cages.

Seat recline adjusts through ranges similar to a Catrike Trail or 
Expedition. Converts between high speed 26" hardtail and suspended 20" 
roadster in about 30 minutes.

This is a sensible performance bike for a shorter person. It climbs

I used this Shimano XTR 160 mm Centerlock rotor for 2503 km (1551.86 miles) on dry roads only. It is in excellent condition. I weighed it with the included lockring at 135 g which is light for a disc brake rotor. It has a thick aluminium spider and steel braking surface so it runs more true and has better heat dissipation than conventional all steel brake rotors. It will fit any Shimano Centerlock compatible disc brake hub. $33 plus postage if necessary.

Sorry, I talked about this with Alex off-list and I should have
written everyone especially so the list admins would know details.

I have tried out GoogleGroups with other projects and don't like it. I
prefer to continue with mailman.

I intend to ramp up some projects at HuPI.org over the next months. I
am planning on moving the hpv lists to hupi.org.

I am in the process of setting up a new server for HuPI.org that can
handle more traffic. It will probably be at tektonic.net which worked
well for ihpva.org/whpva.org before I backed out of that fray.

Other than the domain name changing AGAIN... (what is this the 4th
time?) sticking with mailman should make the move relatively painless.
Archives are always a problem but they can continue to live at
bikelist.org at least for now.

Thanks Moz and Bob for offering hosting space. Thanks also to the list
admins for their continued support.

Brian

Greetings --

This mailing list "hpv-forsale at bikelist.org" is moving to
"hpv-forsale at hupi.org".

The move will probably commence on Monday or Tuesday, depending on how
busy we are. When Alex (at bikelist.org) is ready, he will turn off
the list at bikelist.org so no new messages will be accepted there
(this includes commands such as subscribe/unsubscribe requests). Alex
will then send the list data to me and I will install it and
reactivate the list at hupi.org.

We're using the same software at both servers so in theory this should
be a simple move.

You don't have to do anything -- except start using the new address
after the move.
I will send another message when the list is running at hupi.org.

this message more than once!

summary: I want to buy at least one each of

1 a "pi-shaped" metal piece that supports the back of the seat of a
  Lightning Stealth. (Hence I'll call it a "Stealth seatstay.")

2 a pair of metal clamps, each of which attaches a leg of the seatstay
  to one of the rear dropouts.

Several image links follow; please let me know if any are inaccessible.

details:

I recently got right-hooked while driving my Lightning (actually LCD)
Stealth. I'm mostly OK, as is apparently the Stealth, after having a
local shop rebend some steel. However

1 the Stealth seatstay got broken. Fortunately I have a spare, images of
  which are @

http://tinyurl.com/StealthSeatstayAnnotated (separate, annotated)
http://tinyurl.com/StealthFrameSeatstaySeat (attached to frame and seat)

  The seatstay consists of two legs welded perpendicularly to a single
  crosspiece, giving a shape like a very tall ?. All 3 pieces feel
  like aluminum, but steel would probably work for me: it's a pretty
  heavy bike to begin with, and I usually carry a lotta stuff.

  The crosspiece is ~15 cm long (could be longer--see below) and ~22
  mm wide. More importantly, the crosspiece is a semicircular channel
  that clamps onto a Stealth seat's upper/rear support tube; the
  latter has OD?19.4 mm. Since the crosspiece clamps to a smooth tube,
  its inside surface must also be smooth. In the latter image above,
  only the left side of the crosspiece is (Cateye) clamped: normally,
  both sides would be.

  Each leg is a piece of round stock ~55 cm long with OD?12.5 mm, and
  slightly bent. However I don't need all the "leg" length (see
  below): a leg length of 40 cm should suffice, if you've got one
  that's cut down. I also don't see the need for the bends, and
  suspect one could use a longer crosspiece with straight legs (more
  below), but that's how the Stealth seatstay (which may have been
  used on other models) was designed.

  Each of the two legs slides snugly into a clamp that bolts into the
  rear dropout (more below), hence the center-to-center separation of
  the ends of the legs (~160 mm) must match that of the clamps when
  attached to the dropouts; this is another critical dimension.

  The bottom of the blue tape on each leg (see first image above)
  marks the point to which the top of the clamp slides when mounted in
  my customary configuration. As visible in the latter image, the legs
  are overlong for my application, since I keep the seat fairly
  reclined and close to the rear triangle. Accordingly, a leg length
  of ~40 cm would probably work for me.

  The crosspiece ends of the legs are ~102 mm apart, center-to-center.
  This dimension is probably not crucial, as long as the crosspiece
  attachments are symmetric and widely spaced. Again, I don't see why
  one couldn't do straight legs with, e.g., a crosspiece?180 mm.

2 one of the clamps got lost, so I need at least 1, and preferably 2.
  For clamp closeups, see

http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampAttached (attached to left rear dropout)
http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampSideView (separate, side view)
http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampFrontView (separate, front view)
http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampTopView (separate, top view)

  Each clamp has 3 features, orthogonically oriented: one hole
  (ID?12.5 mm) drilled to accept one leg of the seatstay, a slot to
  better clamp the seatstay leg, and a hole drilled to accept an M5
  screw to secure the leg in the clamp and the clamp to a rear
  dropout.

  Each clamp is ~25 mm x 19 mm x 19 mm. Those dimensions are probably
  not as critical as those of the two holes, since the clamp must
  accept the seatstay leg and must screw into a standard rear dropout.

If you've got any of these parts, or have suggestions about where to
get them (other than Lightning, who I will contact), please lemme
know item and shipping costs.

Feel free to forward, and TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

I bought my Cambie Recumboni X2 new in 1999 two months before I broke my leg in a crash on another bike, and it hasn't been ridden at all since we moved in 2002, so it has spent most of its life in storage. It has direct over-seat steering (like the Tour Easy) instead of the later-model link-steering. Rans seats, Arai rear hub brake with stoker lever, fenders, kickstand, rear rack, bottle cages, Shimano/Sakae drivetrain. Weight is listed by the importer as 45 pounds. $1995/best-offer/trade, plus shipping from Las Vegas if necessary ($150 to $300, depending upon destination) or come pick it up while you stay at the Strip -- be sure to bring a trailer, van, or truck!

If anyone out there has the stock seatstay and clamps from a Rotator Tiger
or Pursuit available, those might help Tom.

I'm a happy user of a TerraCycle idler, so am definitely interested in

I'm assuming you mean the clamps that attach the seatstay to the
rear dropout braze-on--correct? If so,

1 could you point me to a page with the details?

2 do you make 1/2" dropout clamps? and if so, details please.

Why I ask:

I can probably get my single-unit 1/2" Stealth pi-shaped seatstay

http://tinyurl.com/StealthSeatstayAnnotated

replaced by a local metal shop, but not its dropout clamps

http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampAttached

I can also buy a pair of 3/8" Rotator seatstays, but (wait for it ...)
not their dropout clamps.
