<PRE>
summary: I want to buy at least one each of

1 a &quot;pi-shaped&quot; metal piece that supports the back of the seat of a
  Lightning Stealth. (Hence I'll call it a &quot;Stealth seatstay.&quot;)

2 a pair of metal clamps, each of which attaches a leg of the seatstay
  to one of the rear dropouts.

Several image links follow; please let me know if any are inaccessible.

details:

I recently got right-hooked while driving my Lightning (actually LCD)
Stealth. I'm mostly OK, as is apparently the Stealth, after having a
local shop rebend some steel. However

1 the Stealth seatstay got broken. Fortunately I have a spare, images of
  which are @

<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/StealthSeatstayAnnotated">http://tinyurl.com/StealthSeatstayAnnotated</A> (separate, annotated)
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/StealthFrameSeatstaySeat">http://tinyurl.com/StealthFrameSeatstaySeat</A> (attached to frame and seat)

  The seatstay consists of two legs welded perpendicularly to a single
  crosspiece, giving a shape like a very tall &#960;. All 3 pieces feel
  like aluminum, but steel would probably work for me: it's a pretty
  heavy bike to begin with, and I usually carry a lotta stuff.

  The crosspiece is ~15 cm long (could be longer--see below) and ~22
  mm wide. More importantly, the crosspiece is a semicircular channel
  that clamps onto a Stealth seat's upper/rear support tube; the
  latter has OD&#8776;19.4 mm. Since the crosspiece clamps to a smooth tube,
  its inside surface must also be smooth. In the latter image above,
  only the left side of the crosspiece is (Cateye) clamped: normally,
  both sides would be.

  Each leg is a piece of round stock ~55 cm long with OD&#8776;12.5 mm, and
  slightly bent. However I don't need all the &quot;leg&quot; length (see
  below): a leg length of 40 cm should suffice, if you've got one
  that's cut down. I also don't see the need for the bends, and
  suspect one could use a longer crosspiece with straight legs (more
  below), but that's how the Stealth seatstay (which may have been
  used on other models) was designed.

  Each of the two legs slides snugly into a clamp that bolts into the
  rear dropout (more below), hence the center-to-center separation of
  the ends of the legs (~160 mm) must match that of the clamps when
  attached to the dropouts; this is another critical dimension.

  The bottom of the blue tape on each leg (see first image above)
  marks the point to which the top of the clamp slides when mounted in
  my customary configuration. As visible in the latter image, the legs
  are overlong for my application, since I keep the seat fairly
  reclined and close to the rear triangle. Accordingly, a leg length
  of ~40 cm would probably work for me.

  The crosspiece ends of the legs are ~102 mm apart, center-to-center.
  This dimension is probably not crucial, as long as the crosspiece
  attachments are symmetric and widely spaced. Again, I don't see why
  one couldn't do straight legs with, e.g., a crosspiece&#8776;180 mm.

2 one of the clamps got lost, so I need at least 1, and preferably 2.
  For clamp closeups, see

<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampAttached">http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampAttached</A> (attached to left rear dropout)
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampSideView">http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampSideView</A> (separate, side view)
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampFrontView">http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampFrontView</A> (separate, front view)
<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampTopView">http://tinyurl.com/StealthClampTopView</A> (separate, top view)

  Each clamp has 3 features, orthogonically oriented: one hole
  (ID&#8776;12.5 mm) drilled to accept one leg of the seatstay, a slot to
  better clamp the seatstay leg, and a hole drilled to accept an M5
  screw to secure the leg in the clamp and the clamp to a rear
  dropout.

  Each clamp is ~25 mm x 19 mm x 19 mm. Those dimensions are probably
  not as critical as those of the two holes, since the clamp must
  accept the seatstay leg and must screw into a standard rear dropout.

If you've got any of these parts, or have suggestions about where to
get them (other than Lightning, who I will contact), please lemme
know item and shipping costs.

Feel free to forward, and TIA, Tom Roche &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/hpv-forsale">Tom_Roche at pobox.com</A>&gt;
