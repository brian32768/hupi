<PRE>Includes all parts for both the rear suspended 20&quot; wheel, with Trice 
custom 9-32 tooth cassette, and hardtail 26&quot;. We will set up this trike 
either way before shipping to you. Conversion is pretty easy. This is 
about $3500 worth of trike once you figure in all costs. We can ship it 
most places for less than $100, disassembled.

The ICE Q is now called the Sprint, now built them in Taiwan. This trike 
is one of the last to be built in-house in Cornwall. This is the wide 
31.5&quot; track version for extra stability when cornering.

This trike has 3400 miles on it but still looks new. No scratches, no 
dings. The black 20&quot; suspended rear section has a wet glossy look that 
the photo does little justice to.

Parts include XT rear derailer, SRAM X9 front derailer, Schwalbe Durano 
front tires, Kojak 20&quot; rear or Schwalbe Big Apple 26&quot; rear. 
Sturmey-Archer drum brake front hubs (less abrupt, more user-friendly 
stopping than disks). 152mm Trice front cranks with Rotor Q-Rings 
22-32-44 triple set. Foam seat cushion insert from Trice. Chain is in OK 
shape, but should be replaced before major riding.

Some parts shown will not transfer. The 650C rear wheel will be 
retained, as will the pedals, Cateye computer, and one of the bottle cages.

Seat recline adjusts through ranges similar to a Catrike Trail or 
Expedition. Converts between high speed 26&quot; hardtail and suspended 20&quot; 
roadster in about 30 minutes.
