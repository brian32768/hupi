Subject: [hpv-forsale] Tilting Hardware for sale
Message-ID: <037e01cfbaf0$efd11c50$cf7354f0$@com>

I made my FWD delta trike into a tilter. See attached "Tilter left.jpg"

Non tilter build info here:
http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/Teubner/orangeII.htm

The tilter works well, but I but decided (after 140 miles) that I don't like
the tilter and am going to reinstall the solid rear axle.

So I'm selling everything you need to make a tilter on a 2" diameter pipe.
See attached "Bare right.jpg"

You supply wheels (with 1/2" axle) and disc brake caliper (for tilt lock).

Can deliver to Battle Mountain.

I have around $625 cash into this project.

Can also supply 2-D cad drawings if someone wants to build their own
