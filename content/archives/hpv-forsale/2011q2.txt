I want a holder for "conventional-sized" liter water bottles (like the
plastic bottles in which water is bought @ grocery stores, or a
Nalgene), rather than a conventional "water bottle" (like the ones
available @ bike shops). If you've got one, please lemme know

* item description (make, model, condition)
* price
* availability
* shipping cost to zip=27510

Tips regarding places that might have them also appreciated.

Feel free to forward, and TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

I have a liter Blackburn bottle holder in good condition. It looks like you
can adjust the length.
