<PRE>I always wanted to be able to rechain my bikes off a bulk spool.
Rechaining my P-38, for instance, takes 2-1/3 &quot;normal&quot; 113-link chins
that you have to pin together, ease the pins, and keep clean all the
while. Well now I can, and so can you.

I'm selling new KMC chain cut to length, dropped into a Priority Mail
box and shipped to you in the US mail.

Because the nature of cut chain, this is a one-way transaction. If you
spec the wrong chain length or decide after the fact that you want a
different chain, there can be no returns. You will get the flavor of
chain (8-speed or 9-speed) you order and the length that you specify.
And it will come in a box. That's it.

For all chains &gt; Five dollar cutting charge

8-speed chain == US$0.10 a link

9-speed chain == US$0.20 a link

Plus postage on all orders, currently US$5

Thus, a chain sized for my P-38 would be $5 + 256 links@ .10 = $25.60
+ $5 postage == $35.60 in 8-speed chain and
$5 + 256 @ .20 = $51.20 + $5 postage == $61.20 in 9-speed chain.

Orders to California addresses add sales tax at 8.75%

You can spec your chain however long you like. You must spec it in
links, which are 24 to the foot in new chain.

Please reply to this e-mail if interested.
