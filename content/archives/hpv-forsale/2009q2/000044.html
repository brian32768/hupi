<PRE>I am selling my one of a kind Inspired Cycle Engineering Mini Light.  
It has
been meticulously set up using much better than stock components and has
been well maintained. I take very god care of my recumbents and have a
maintenance log for the Mini. I originally took delivery of the  
frameset in
September 2002 and first rode the completed trike on 25 October 2002.

The Mini is the most compact recumbent trike I know of due to its narrow
track, short wheelbase and use of 349 mm wheels. The combination of  
narrow
track, short overall length, rear suspension, rear rack, mudguards with
reflective stripes on all wheels, low maintenance hydraulic disc  
brakes and
internal gearing through a Rohloff Speedhub that can be shifted into  
any of
14 gear ratios while stopped, coasting or pedalling make this the ideal
trike for commuting. The gear range is currently 16.44&quot; to 86.46&quot; but  
the
526% overall gear range can easily be moved up or down by simply  
replacing
the chainring or rear cog with one of another size. Also the bottom  
bracket
shell is chamfered for a Schlumpf Speed Drive should you want a wider
overall gear range. I originally configured it with a Speed Drive but  
found
I wasn't using the overdrive gears so converted it to a conventional  
bottom
bracket and single chainring crank to reduce weight, increase  
efficiency and
eliminate accidental front shifting.

The seat is currently set all the way laid back for best aerodynamic
efficiency (29 degrees from horizontal) but can be set as upright as 43
degrees. Information and photos of the Mini can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.ice.hpv.co.uk/custom_trikes/mini.htm">http://www.ice.hpv.co.uk/custom_trikes/mini.htm</A>

The specifications are as follows:

Frame: Yellow Trice Mini Light frameset with rear parking brake  
deleted to
save weight. Custom frame fit option with 20 guage main tube
optimised for rider 73 kg (160 lbs.) or less. Extra set of bottle
bosses under boom. Rear suspension option with Cane Creek AD-5 air shock
with neoprene Lizard Skins boot to protect suspension piston from dirt.
Bottom bracket shell with custom headlight mount braze-on, front  
derailer
post deleted and shell chamfered for a Schlumpf Speed Drive. Double  
Rohloff
cable housing guide braze-ons and left rear dropout for Rohloff OEM axle
cap. No braze-ons for derailer cable housings. Note the Light version  
of the
Mini was a limited edition of an already very rare trike and uses  
thinner
wall tubing and titanium and alloy fasteners to reduce weight.

Seat: Trice carbon fibre

Brake levers: Magura Marta

Brakes: Magura Marta hydraulic disc with 160 mm rotors

Headsets: Stronglight A9 roller bearing

Shifter: Rohloff twist grip on right handlebar

Crank: Tracer 155 mm with single 52T chainring and double guard rings

Bottom Bracket: Shimano UN-72 68 x 107 mm

Cog: Rohloff reversable 15T (when worn reverse for double the life)

Chain: SRAM PC-89R hollow side plate chain

Idler: Stock ICE with stock triple Teflon chain tubes

Front Wheels: Custom built with Velocity Aerohead 32-hole rims, DT  
2.0 mm
spokes with brass nipples, ICE narrow front hubs.
(Note the Velocity Aerohead is the lightest 349 mm rim available yet  
is also
very strong due to its double wall construction and triangular shape)

Rear Wheel: Custom built with Velocity Aerohead 32-hole rim, DT 1.8 mm
spokes with brass nipples, Rohloff Speedhub 500/14 XC/EX, OEM,  
silver. The
Rohloff bearings and seals have been replaced using the newest type  
which
have lower friction than the original seals.

Rim strips: Velox tape

Cheng Shin 37-349 presta valve

Tyres: Greenspeed Scorcher 40-349 (the lowest rolling resistance 349 mm
tyres available and wide enough to handle potholes streets well)

Skewers: Rear Delta bolt on skewer in place of quick release to save
weight and add security.

Grips: high density foam

Rack: ICE custom tubular steel cantilevered design, black.

Mudguards: ICE with 3M yellow reflective tape applied to the rear
surfaces.

Cyclecomputer: CatEye Cordless 2 mounted to right front mudguard  
mount for
easy visibility. Current odometer reading: 6820.8 kilometres.

Price: $6157.00 plus shipping if shipped. Note ICE no longer makes  
custom
trikes like the Mini but if it were available new at today's prices  
it would
be over $10,000.00.

Note price does not include pedals but I can include the pedals of
your choice at extra cost or sell without pedals. The CatEye
cyclecomputer can be deleted to reduce the price by $32. The Tracer  
155 mm
cranks can be exchanged for 170 mm Tracer cranks at no additional  
charge or
the crankset of your choice can be installed.

I can remove the rear wheel with Rohloff hub and remove the Rohloff  
shifter and chain tensioner for a price reduction of $1200 to $4957.  
At this price it would be sold without the rear wheel and you could  
set it up with a rear derailer and SRAM Dual Drive equipped rear  
wheel. Or if you want to configure it with conventional gearing with  
front and rear derailers, I can remove the crankset and bottom  
bracket and sell it with a spare matching yellow boom equipped with a  
front derailer post long enough to run up to a 73T front chainring.  
This would reduce the price by $115 to $4842.
