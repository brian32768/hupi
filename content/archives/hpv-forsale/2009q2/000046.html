<PRE>FS: Challenge Hurricane SL $2100

	I purchased this bike in 2007 from Samuel Harris, who purchased it from 
Kelvin at Angletech as a demo in 2006. I believe it is a 2005. I put on 
about 1000 miles in the last 2 years. It is an absolute speed demon, and 
can climb really well for a 'bent. I have switched out the tires, tubes, 
wheelset, brakes, and front fork. I also changed the second front ring 
to a 56 and went from a road cassette to a mountain one, mainly because 
some of the hilly terrain in Vermont required some more intense brakes 
and nifty climbing gears. It is the fastest bike I have ever ridden, 
hands down, but it is low enough to make it impractical for uses other 
than a road ride. The bike is in good shape, but after a long ride (few 
hours) I find that the Challenge air shock slowly leaks.
	I built some volae/bacchetta inspired dual 559 and 700c highracer 
frames this winter. These are much more multi-purpose, and I need some 
money to spec them out, so I am selling this beautiful machine.

2005 Challenge Hurricane SL flat black.
-Ultegra components, 165mm cranks, 56, 60 tooth challenge front ring 
with guard. unused inner ring on cranks. Aluminum mainframe, Front fork, 
and boom, injection molded- aerospace bonded carbon fiber / aluminum 
rear swingarm and dropouts, challenge air shock, Ti tiller stem, SRAM 
Attack shifters, radius cyclocross brake levers. BB7 Front and Rear Disc 
Brakes, pair spoked Velocity Thracian 9spd. Rear disc wheel 11-34t. 
Velocity Aeroheat &amp; Velocity hub front disc wheel 406 x 1.5&quot; Primo Comet 
tires/tube. I am also including the challenge powerbrake II brake set 
and 406 Schwalbe Stelvio tires/tubes so you can take the rotors and 
calipers off, put the power brakes on and shed some weight if you don't 
want/need the discs. Comes with a computer as well.

I can send pictures if you are interested.

-thanks for looking
