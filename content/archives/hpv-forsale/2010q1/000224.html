<PRE>I am selling my one of a kind Inspired Cycle Engineering Mini Light.  
It has
been meticulously set up using much better than stock components and has
been well maintained. I take very god care of my recumbents and have a
maintenance log for the Mini. I originally took delivery of the  
frameset in
September 2002 and first rode the completed trike on 25 October 2002.

The Mini is the most compact recumbent trike I know of due to its narrow
track, short wheelbase and use of 349 mm wheels. The combination of  
narrow
track, short overall length, rear suspension, rear rack, and  
mudguards with
reflective stripes on all wheels makes this a great trike for urban  
commuting and transportation.

The seat is currently set all the way laid back for best aerodynamic
efficiency (29 degrees from horizontal) but can be set as upright as 43
degrees.

The specifications are as follows:

Frame: Yellow Trice Mini Light frameset with rear parking brake  
deleted to
save weight. Custom frame fit option with 20 guage main tube
optimised for rider 73 kg (160 lbs.) or less. Extra set of bottle
bosses under boom. Rear suspension option with Cane Creek AD-5 air shock
with neoprene Lizard Skins boot to protect suspension piston from dirt.
Bottom bracket shell with custom headlight mount braze-on, front  
derailer
post deleted and shell chamfered for a Schlumpf Speed Drive. Double  
Rohloff
cable housing guide braze-ons and left rear dropout for Rohloff OEM axle
cap. No braze-ons for derailer cable housings. Note the Light version  
of the
Mini was a limited edition of an already very rare trike and uses  
thinner
wall tubing and titanium and alloy fasteners to reduce weight.

Seat: Trice carbon fibre

Brake levers: Magura Marta

Brakes: Magura Marta hydraulic disc with 160 mm rotors

Headsets: Stronglight A9 roller bearing

Shifter: Rohloff twist grip on right handlebar

Bottom Bracket: Shimano UN-72 68 x 107 mm

Chain: SRAM PC-89R hollow side plate chain

Idler: Stock ICE with stock triple Teflon chain tubes

Front Wheels: Custom built with Velocity Aerohead 32-hole rims, DT  
2.0 mm
spokes with brass nipples, ICE narrow front hubs.
(Note the Velocity Aerohead is the lightest 349 mm rim available yet  
is also
very strong due to its double wall construction and triangular shape)

Rim strips: Velox tape

Cheng Shin 37-349 presta valve

Tyres: Greenspeed Scorcher 40-349 (the lowest rolling resistance 349 mm
tyres available and wide enough to handle potholes streets well)

Rack: ICE custom tubular steel cantilevered design, black.

Mudguards: ICE with 3M yellow reflective tape applied to the rear
surfaces.

Cyclecomputer: CatEye Cordless 2 mounted to right front mudguard  
mount for
easy visibility. Current odometer reading: 6820.8 kilometres.

Note, I sold the crankset and Rohloff drivetrain that was on this  
trike so it will need a new rear wheel and drivetrain. I can be  
configured with variety of drivetrains such as single chainring with  
a SRAM Dual Drive hub or Rohloff Speedhub, conventional rear hub with  
a Schlumpf drive up front or a conventional drivetrain with triple  
crankset and derailers. Includes both a front boom without derailer  
post for setting up with a single chainring and a front boom with a  
derailer post long enough to run up to a 73T chainring.

Photos available.

Price: $4395 plus shipping. The CatEye cyclecomputer can be deleted  
to reduce the price
by $32.
