<PRE>This kit came off of an HP Velotechnik Scorpion and was only used for  
short test rides.  Busch &amp; M&#252;ller Dymotec 6 sidewall dynamo with  
Lumotec Oval Plus headlight and DToplight Plus tail light. Wiring is  
included, but I can't guarantee that it will be long enough for your  
bike. Tail light is designed to be mounted on a rear rack with 2  
bolts that can be set to 50 mm or 80mm apart. Various mounts are  
available for the headlight to mount it to a fork crown, handlebar,  
TerraCycle Accessory Mount or braze-on fitting typically found on the  
front of a European recumbent (headlight mount not included). The  
dynamo comes  with a bracket to mount it to a pair of threaded  
fittings on the inside of the left chainstay of an HP Velotechnik  
bike or trike. Clamps are available to mount it to the left chainstay  
of other brands of bikes. See: <A HREF="http://peterwhitecycles.com/dymotec.asp">http://peterwhitecycles.com/dymotec.asp</A>

The headlight has a 2.4 watt halogen bulb and also a white LED which  
only comes on while stopped and runs on a capacitor for several  
minutes to provide a reduced level of light while stopped. The LED  
taillight also has a capacitor which runs it at full brightness for  
several minutes while stopped. The sidewall driven dynamo has more  
drag than hub dynamos and makes a humming noise but it is also  
lighter weight, less expensive, doesn't require building a new wheel  
and doesn't produce any drag when the lights aren't in use. Hub  
dynamos always have a small amount of drag even when the lights are  
off. So this would be a good system for someone who primarily rides  
in the day but wants a battery free system in case they get caught in  
the dark. $50 plus postage.
