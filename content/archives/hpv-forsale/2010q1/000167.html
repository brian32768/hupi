<PRE>NIB SRAM 7.0 rear derailer:
New in never opened package 2009 SRAM 7.0 long cage rear derailer,  
long cage black version. Claimed weight is 270 grams.
It will work with any SRAM 8 or 9-speed shifters with numbers in  
their names such as X.0, X.9, X.7, X.5, 9.0, 7.0 etc. $35

Slightly used SRAM X.0 rear derailer:
I only used this 2009 SRAM X.0 rear derailer for a few rides in dry  
weather and it looks new. It is the long cage version and was SRAM's  
highest end derailer in 2009 (and still their highest end 9-speed  
derailer). It will work with any SRAM 8 or 9-speed shifters with  
numbers in their names such as X.0, X.9, X.7, X.5, 9.0, 7.0 etc. I  
weighed it at 200 grams which is very light for any rear derailer,  
especially one with a long cage. Photos available. $140.

Used Avid BB&amp; disc brake:
2009 Avid BB7 (mountain version) mechanical disc brake with 203 mm  
rotor (6-bolt international standard) and both front and rear  
mounting hardware. I used this brake for 1073 km (665 miles) and it  
has new, never used pads (the stock Avid pads it came with). Other  
than some scrapes it is in good condition and I can provide photos. $38.

Used Shimano 600 headset:
This Shimano 600 HP-6500 1 inch threaded headset is Ultegra level and  
has cartridge bearings. It came on a bike I bought new in June 1999  
and I recently upgraded the fork on this bike and the new fork  
required a threadless headset so I'm selling this Shimano 600  
headset. It has been ridden about 6000 km mostly in dry weather and  
was still turning just as smoothly as when it was new when I took  
took it out of service. The cartridge bearings are readily available  
from Shimano and I believe this model headset is still in production.  
$35.

NIB Planet Bike Cascadia road fenders:
I have a new in package set of Planet Bike Cascadia fenders in the  
road 35 mm wide version in black. I decided not to turn the bike I  
got them for into a rain bike so am offering them for sale for $23.  
These are premium fenders with stainless steel hardware and long  
mudflaps and normally they are $55. Here is a link to them: http:// 
ecom1.planetbike.com/7028_5.html
Note these are for 622 mm (AKA 700C) wheels front and rear.

Nightsun light parts:
I was cleaning out my lighting collection and found the following  
surplus Nightsun parts:

2 new SunSport 6V 6W sealed bulb-reflector units, retails for $19.95,  
will sell these for $10 each.

1 new TriLight 12V 7.5W MR11 sealed bulb-reflector, retails for  
$19.95, will sell for $10.

1 new in box Lithium SunSport, very lightweight and bright emergency  
backup light that can be mounted to helmet. See: <A HREF="http://www.night-">http://www.night-</A> 
sun.com/htmldocs/sunsport_lite.html retails for $39.95, will sell for  
$20.

1 SunSport headlight with cord and switch. Missing the NiCd battery  
and charger. See:
<A HREF="http://www.night-sun.com/htmldocs/sunsport.html">http://www.night-sun.com/htmldocs/sunsport.html</A> $20.

2 Prostick 9-LED taillights. These were the first high intensity  
remote battery powered LED taillights from the early 1990's. Clear  
plastic tube contains 9 LEDs which are steady (no flashing mode).  
Includes mounting bracket cord with Molex plug. Runs off 12V. These  
were the brightest taillights available in their day and are similar  
in brightness to the NiteRider 16-LED taillights. $20 each.
