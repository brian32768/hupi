Purple with yellow seat, Rohloff Speedhub 14 speed rear hub, single front sprocket, 20 inch wheels, adjustable boom&#8230;.fits small-medium rider&#8230;but with adjustable boom.&#160; Drum brakes, Max Hookwork tires on front and checkerboard pattern on the rear.

Asking $3290&#8230;..GREAT RIDE!&#160;&#160; 

Greenspeed. GT&#160; $2490 LIME GREEN Trike....Vintage Trike (Serial #00070) 

Who else do you know that owns a vintage lime green Greenspeed?&#160; Lime Green color; Yellow seat; ( I have a new replacement seat I'll include)&#160; Basic grip shift shifting 3 X 6, 20 inch wheels. ....professional tuned by bike mechanic.

Since this is a Chromoly frame you can expect to use this trike for a little rougher track than the lightweight ones. (Read that as I can carry more behind it, I can take it on rougher territory). It's not heavy, but it is sturdy. This trike is serial number #00070.&#160; Vintage cyclists will love the well made nature of this trike and because of it's great history.&#160;&#160; This trike is for the smaller rider-medium rider. I'm 5'4 and it's my size at the lowest boom point...Adjustable boom. Drum Brakes.&#160; Found in Australia a few years ago with the help of Ian Sims.

$2490... Great trike waiting for your customization or simply to ride and enjoy.
