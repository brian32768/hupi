<PRE>Purple 2005 GTO with Rohloff Speedhub&#160; $3390
Unique
GTO2020 Purchased 2005, LIKE NEW with less than 200 miles logged.
Purple with yellow seat, Rohloff 14 speed rear hub, single front
sprocket, 20 inch wheels, adjustable boom&#8230;.fits small-medium rider&#8230;but
with adjustable boom.&#160; Drum brakes, Max Hookwork tires on front and checkerboard pattern on the rear. This trike was over $5,500 new&#8230; with Rohloff
hub.&#160; Asking $3390 OBO&#8230;..GREAT RIDE!&#160;&#160; Why am I selling this?&#160; Bought it
for my wife and she wants to pay the money on some credit cards.&#160; email
<A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv-forsale">joelblaylock at yahoo.com</A> for photos.
LIME GREEN Older Trike....Vintage Trike by Greenspeed. GT serial # 0070&#160; $2590
Why
will you like this trike ?: Lime Green color; Yellow seat; ( I have a
new replacement seat I'll include, as this one is showing some wear.)&#160;
Basic grip shift shifting 3 (internal rear) X 6 external rear; 1 front , 20 inch wheels Primo-Monster tires.&#160; 15 years
old is my best guess. I am the second owner for the last 10 years;
minimal mileage!


Since this is a Chromoly frame you can expect to use this
trike for a little rougher track than the lightweight ones.&#160; It's not
heavy, but it is sturdy. This trike is serial number #0070.&#160; Vintage
cyclists will love the well made nature of
this trike and it's great history. Who else do you know that owns a
vintage Greenspeed ?&#160; This trike is for the smaller-medium rider.
I'm 5'4 and it's my size at the lowest boom point...Adjustable boom.
Drum Brakes.&#160; Found in the Down Under with the help of Ian Sims (A
wonderful supporter of all things trike!!) Why am I selling, I need the
money for school!


$2590 OBO...;&#160; Great trike waiting for your customization or simply to ride and enjoy.email <A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv-forsale">joelblaylock at yahoo.com</A> for photos.

Fit at the closest pulled in boom fits my X-Seam of 36 on both bikes.
