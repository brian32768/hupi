<PRE>Unique GTO 2020 Purchased 2005, LIKE NEW with less than 200 miles logged. Purple with yellow seat,  (nice tasteful purple, bottom photo taken with Iphone and therefore the color difference). Rohloff 14 speed rear hub, single front sprocket, 20 inch wheels, adjustable boom&#8230;.fits small-medium rider&#8230;but with adjustable boom.  Drum brakes, Maxxis Hookworm tires on front and Maxxis checkerboard pattern on the rear. This trike was over $5,500 new&#8230; with Rohloff hub.  Asking $3750&#8230;..GREAT RIDE!   Why am I selling this?  Bought it for my wife and she wants to pay the money on some credit cards.

Shipping: It depends. Near Dallas,  I can possibly meet you for gas and tolls. Taken to a bike shop,  $150-$200 postage, plus whatever my LBS charges to package.&#8230;Fits in over-sized box! My local bike shop will package and item will be insured, if shipped.

This hub works behind the scene to make shifting a breeze. Just shift and go! All the magic works as you normally shift.

The Rohloff SPEEDHUB 500/14 has been developed for both pros and performance oriented hobby cyclists who can appreciate it because of its reliability, perfect single gear ratios, wide range of gears, low maintenance and easy operation; its weight and efficiency are ideal even for pro racing. 

The sealed gearbox ensures reliability and durability even under the toughest conditions. The even increments of 13.6% from gear to gear make it possible to always ride at the performance peak. The overall range makes sure that you have the right gear in every situation. Pure fun is guaranteed. 

The SPEEDHUB 500/14 is operated by a twist shifter which shifts simply by pulling separate cables up or down. The indexing of the shifting lies not in the shifter as with common designs, but inside the hub. There is no wear on the indexing system nor need to adjust it.
