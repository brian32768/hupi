Hot actually, because I was just hiking in the snow.
16" in Corvallis...

That qualifies as "human power" but not "for sale"

I did not click the spam link that sneaked through.
I imagine there is antispam software that would have caught that
but every 30 days I debate shutting these lists down...

Naaaa, because of low traffic, but it's close to zero maintenance at this
point too so as long as I keep a  mail server running it's not a problem to
keep it running.

I hope you are not considering shutting the list down because you think my email was spam. I suspect that I inadvertently hit the "send" button on a draft that dated back many years while I was cleaning out my "draft" folder. I have been remiss in not doing proper housecleaning of my files and was catching up yesterday. 


all the best,

I would say that the HPV lists have been supplanted by sites like Bentrider and Recumbents.com and thus the low traffic. Like everything in computing, things just keep evolving.  I am still a member but really no longer pay attention. Spend most of my time over at BROL. Even Bike Forums has a section for bents. If its not big deal for you to keep the server up, I guess its fine for the few people that still watch the HPV lists.
