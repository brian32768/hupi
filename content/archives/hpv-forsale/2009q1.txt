Subject: [hpv-forsale] Bacchetta Giro 26 for sale
Message-ID: <0016361643a9e0a9fd046050e1d6@google.com>

I am selling my Giro 26. Medium size frame. Recurve seat. Brakes upgraded  
to Avid BB7.

It is one year old and in excellent condition. I rode about 1200 miles on  
that bike last year.
Only time this bike has seen water is when I clean it. Never been out in  
the rain.

I am asking $1200. I can ship it anywhere in the lower 48 for $100.

Message-ID: <AD4F2A9B-9A50-4CB5-AF0A-0E7CF8F03DC6@earthlink.net>

2008 Bacchetta Corsa, Large, Black, Carbon Hardshell Seat, Several  
upgrades from stock including SRAM PC-991 Hollow Pin Chain, Shimano  
Dura Ace Bar End Shifters, Velogenesis Seat Clamps.  This bike is  
slightly used and in brand new condition.  It served as John  
Schlitter's RAAM back up bike on last years epic race.  John estimates  
that he might have 200 miles on the bike and I've ridden it another  
100 miles.

I'd like $1,700 for the bike plus actual shipping costs, or pick it up  
in Peyton, Colorado and save yourself the shipping.

If interested and you would like some photos, let me know as I just  
took a few and can e-mail them.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <20090126143152.D598E145CE034@cedar.isis.unc.edu>


The seat saddle on my Stealth recently broke: the cross piece (to
which the seat frame clamps) broke on both sides at the weld which
joins the cross piece to the larger piece (which clamps to the main
tube). I've asked Lightning about a replacement, but would also be
interested in a used or new piece you might have.

Message-ID: <5170B3B9-6C6A-4369-A575-7C553DC860A2@earthlink.net>

I have a new old stock 2006 USS Grasshopper full suspension SWB  
recumbent. It has never been sold so has the new bike warranty and it  
has only been used for short test rides in dry weather, never crashed  
or scratched so looks new. The only difference between it and the  
current models is it doesn't have the quick release seat (the system  
with the 3 quick releases is retrofittable) and its optional disc  
brakes are Avid BB5 rather than the BB7 they started using in 2008.

The specs and 2009 pricing are as follows:
Grasshopper base bike, green $2590
Under seat steering $59
SRAM Dual Drive 24-speed drivetrain (stock)
MEKS carbon fork with adjustable hydraulic damping $229
Avid BB5 disc brakes (BB7 on current model) $199
Schmidt hub powered headlight & taillight with wiring internally  
routed through frame and rack $469
HP Velotechnik rear rack $115
HP Velotechnik lowrider rack $110
Kickstand $27
SKS mudguards with flaps $59
Standard spring rear shock
Import charges $169
Total $4026

This would make a great commuting or touring bike for those who  
prefer the smooth ride of full suspension.
$2500 plus shipping if it needs to be shipped.

2008 Rans Screamer Tandem, $3900 plus shipping

Includes featherweight seat cushions, centerstand, and Power Grips on 
the pedals

All stock parts otherwise. Owner is selling because the stoker lost the 
urge to ride.  Under 300 miles, gently used, garage kept.

This is not the Traveler version with the frame couplers, so it will 
incur oversize fees to ship. However, we have the original box 
available. Most likely the frame will ship in one box, the wheels in a 
second box, and the seats in a third, though we may find a box big 
enough for the seats and wheels together. Estimated shipping is probably 
around $175.

I am selling a Zipp 404 571 mm (AKA 650c) clincher front wheel which  
I have used on my Bacchetta Carbon Aero for less than 1000 km (did 3  
double centuries on it). The wheel is in excellent condition with no  
visible sidewall wear and the only sign of use is some black marks on  
the sidewalls from the brake pad rubber. I have only ridden this  
wheel on the 3 double centuries and some short test rides and have  
never ridden it in the rain. I am a lightweight rider at 64 kg. The  
wheel has 16 bladed spokes, a 60 mm deep rim section for excellent  
aerodynamics and is light for an aero clincher wheel. I weighed it at  
712 g. New these wheels are $945, I'm selling this one for $600 plus  
shipping.

Message-ID: <F773844F-0464-46A6-8C51-D607F55A361D@earthlink.net>

I am selling this heavy duty tandem wheelset which has plenty of life  
left in the rim sidewalls. Phil Wood hubs have a reputation for being  
extremely high quality and durable though heavy. Sun Rhyno rims have  
an outside width of 26 mm and thick walled construction so they are  
very strong and the sidewalls are long lasting though they are also  
heavy. This wheelset would make a good upgrade to a 406/559 tandem  
such as a RANS Screamer, ATP Double Vision or Ryan Duplex.

Front wheel has a silver Phil Wood tandem hub, silver 406 mm Sun  
Rhyno rim and 36 Sapim 2 mm stainless steel spokes. A new Phil Wood  
front tandem hub alone is $142. I'll sell the complete front wheel  
for $140 plus postage.


Rear wheel has a silver Phil Wood tandem hub with 145 mm dropout  
spacing and is threaded for an Arai drum brake laced to a silver 559  
mm Sun Rhyno rim with 40 Sapim 2 mm stainless steel spokes. A new  
Phil Wood rear tandem hub alone is $438. I'll sell the complete rear  
wheel for $435 plus postage.

Or buy the complete front and rear set for $500 plus postage.
