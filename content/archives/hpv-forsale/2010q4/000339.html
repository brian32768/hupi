<PRE>2009 RANS Seavo tandem, yellow, non-S&amp;S coupled version. This has  
been ridden as a demo bike and has only 829.6 kilometres on the  
odometer (514.4 miles). It looks new, has never been sold and is  
being offered as a new bike with new bike warranty. This bike has the  
following upgrades over a stock Seavo shown here: http:// 
ransbikes.com/Seavo.htm

Deleted the stock 170 mm cranks and installed da Vinci 150 mm cranks  
on Tange alloy cup bottom brackets as the 170 mm cranks on a previous  
Seavo I had were ill suited to this bike design since they resulted  
in massive heel to front wheel interference on tight turns and the  
stoker's heels scraping the ground when cornering. The 150 mm cranks  
solve these problems plus make for smoother spinning, are easier on  
the knees allow running the handlebars lower and slightly reduce  
frontal area. I run 150-155 mm cranks on all my personal bikes and  
have long legs. The daVinci tandem crankset has daVinci 34T timing  
rings and Sugino 44/32/22 drive rings. If for some reason you want to  
use longer cranks, I can remove the da Vinci cranks and Tange bottom  
brackets for a cost reduction or change them out for the cranks and  
bottom brackets of your choice.

Replaced the much too wide RANS handlebars with Bacchetta handlebars  
which are also lighter. These are the same handlebars used on the  
Bacchetta Giro, not the narrower ones used on the Corsa and CA 2.0. I  
actually initially tried the narrower version of the Bacchetta  
handlebars and found them too narrow on tight turns as the front  
wheel has to be turned more on low speed turns on the tandem due to  
its much longer wheelbase.

Replaced the too tall RANS steering riser tube with a Bacchetta riser  
tube which brings the handlebars down to a more ergonomic position  
less in the line of sight yet still has plenty of leg clearance. Also  
saves weight.

Deleted rear V-Brake as the dual 203 mm Avid BB7 brakes offer plenty  
of braking power and heat dissipation area and I don't like the idea  
of the stoker having a brake as the stock setup has.

Replaced the heavy SRAM 11-32 cassette with a lighter weight and  
better shifting Shimano XT 11-32 cassette.

Replaced the grey Avid Speed Dial 7 brake levers with black SRAM 9.0  
brake levers to cosmetically match the black handlebars and for a  
slight weight savings.

Replaced the stock thick seat pads with RANS thin seat covers with  
integrated foam to save weight, make it easier to put the feet down  
and reduce the leg angle to the pedals for increased comfort and  
pedaling efficiency for short stokers. I can swap back one or both  
pads for the stock pads at no extra cost. Here is a link for the thin  
pad: <A HREF="http://www.shoprans.com/proddetail.asp?prod=BPST0133">http://www.shoprans.com/proddetail.asp?prod=BPST0133</A>

Replaced wide carbon fibre stoker seat base with a narrower RANS  
Zephyr carbon fibre seat base to reduce leg to seat base rub for  
shorter stokers.

Added CatEye Strada Wireless cyclecomputer cleanly installed behind  
the top of the steering riser where it doesn't add any frontal area  
or get in the way.

New the stock Seavo is $6575. The price on this one is $4895 if  
picked up locally. I'd prefer not to ship it but do have the original  
wooden shipping box which is too large for UPS so it has to be  
transported by some sort of trucking company.
