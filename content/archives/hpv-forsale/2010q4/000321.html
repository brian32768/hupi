<PRE>
Please recommend a source for a replacement jockey wheel for my Stealth.
Extra points for a supplier in biking distance of Chapel Hill, NC.
Why I ask:

I had noticed increased drivetrain noise on my Stealth for awhile.
Process of elimination led me to the upper jockey wheel: when I removed
it, the plastic part crumbled away from the sealed bearing. (FWIW I
believe this was OEM from 1997.) I tried just removing it and using a
single long (~1m) piece of teflon chain tube (from Hostel Shoppe--I'd
appreciate local suppliers of that, too) fixed to the crossbar underside
of the Stealth's seat (which mates to a sliding fitting on the Stealth's
main tube). Unfortunately the upper chainline curves, and there's enough
friction between the chain and the chaintube to

- be noticeable. It drops me ~1 speed, and I can feel it while pedaling,
  and maybe hear it (though that may be just suggestability).

- pull the chaintube into the front derailleur. I have the chaintube
  ziptied pretty tightly to the seat crossbar, but there is enough
  friction that cranking the chain slowly but surely pulls the chaintube
  forward.

If there's a better way to do this, please lemme know. Until last week I
was using the upper jockey wheel as designed, but with 2 smaller pieces
of chaintube fore and aft of it attaching to the wheel's &quot;cage&quot; (a piece
of Al with 2 holes through which the jockey-wheel-attaching bolt passed)
via ziptie. The jockey wheel's OD (i.e. of the plastic flange) is ~58 mm
and the cage doesn't look like it would accommodate anything much bigger
(though smaller diameter should be good), and its width is ~13 mm.

TIA, Tom Roche &lt;<A HREF="http://hupi.org/mailman/listinfo/hpv-forsale">Tom_Roche at pobox.com</A>&gt;
