<PRE>The previous owner cared for this bike meticulously, it's in great shape.   A red 1998 Tour Easy, 1 owner.   His description is good - &quot;Has full zzipper fairing. Crank is a Shimano 105 from back when they were nice and hollow. Bottom bracket is, I believe 105. Front der. is 105, rear is XT with XTR pulleys. Rear brake is SRAM 7.0.  Front wheel came from ER and is radially laced LX with Sun rim. Rear wheel is Ultegra and Mavic SUP with XTR cassette. Tires are Conti rear and Kenda front with perhaps 25 miles on them. Possibly 5k miles on the bike.&quot;

Back to Recycled Recumbents.   Frame is in great shape, very clean if I do say so myself.   The tires are 85 PSI commuter tires.   That 105 crankset is a 175mm crank. Frame size is Easy Racer's Large.  The bike shifts well, rides great.  Has water bottle cages, a rack for a pump.  I put a kickstand on it and a Mirracle mirror.   The Bebops on it are for me.  You get regular cage pedals, and if you want them the set of Look pedals that came on the bike.   Fairing is in fair condition - there are cracks at the handlebar mount, both sides - fixed tastefully with Duct tape.   After you fall in love with it and want to put a spiffy fairing on your bike, you can get the experimenter's kit from Zzipper for under $150 and make this bike truly sexy.   Offered at $1,000, I will ship US at your cost.    Thanks for looking.   Pictures on the web at
