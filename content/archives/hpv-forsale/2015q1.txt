Subject: [hpv-forsale] Shutting down lists
Message-ID: <CAFEtus2zi11JsPpkcX5Nz=hOFLFdkTdPz-rm+=vqmWRm=ExvoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Reluctantly I am shutting down these lists soon.
The pipermail archives will remain online indefinitely.

hpv
hpv-forsale
hpv-boats
trikes
velomobile
vph

If someone wants to port any of them to another place I can provide you
with the subscriber list. Write to me directly if you want information.

Message volume is so low that I don't think it's worth the effort to move
them again.
