Message-ID: <438631F2-9ADC-4843-97F5-03C58DBBEC31@earthlink.net>

I took this Ballistic 600A-II suspension fork off a Vision I rode  
about 5000 km in dry weather. The fork is silver, has 40 mm travel  
and has posts for V-Brakes (does not take disc brake). Steerer is a  
threaded 1" diameter x 124 mm length. I'll also include a threadless  
1" x 180 mm steerer that has never been installed. I weighed this  
fork with 124 mm steerer at 1773 grams. Photos available. $100 plus  
postage.

Thanks.

	cut to order
Message-ID: <c74d93000904190800l154b37b0t6700de48d06ec40@mail.gmail.com>

I always wanted to be able to rechain my bikes off a bulk spool.
Rechaining my P-38, for instance, takes 2-1/3 "normal" 113-link chins
that you have to pin together, ease the pins, and keep clean all the
while. Well now I can, and so can you.

I'm selling new KMC chain cut to length, dropped into a Priority Mail
box and shipped to you in the US mail.

Because the nature of cut chain, this is a one-way transaction. If you
spec the wrong chain length or decide after the fact that you want a
different chain, there can be no returns. You will get the flavor of
chain (8-speed or 9-speed) you order and the length that you specify.
And it will come in a box. That's it.

For all chains > Five dollar cutting charge

8-speed chain == US$0.10 a link

9-speed chain == US$0.20 a link

Plus postage on all orders, currently US$5

Thus, a chain sized for my P-38 would be $5 + 256 links@ .10 = $25.60
+ $5 postage == $35.60 in 8-speed chain and
$5 + 256 @ .20 = $51.20 + $5 postage == $61.20 in 9-speed chain.

Orders to California addresses add sales tax at 8.75%

You can spec your chain however long you like. You must spec it in
links, which are 24 to the foot in new chain.

Please reply to this e-mail if interested.

Message-ID: <C69FB124-F00F-4CF8-BD60-C5EEECD1CD46@earthlink.net>

I am selling this heavy duty 406 mm front wheel which has plenty of  
life left in the rim sidewalls. Phil Wood hubs have a reputation for  
being extremely high quality and durable though heavy. Sun Rhyno rims  
have an outside width of 26 mm and thick walled construction so it is  
very strong and the sidewalls are long lasting though also heavy.  
This wheel would be good for a heavy rider, touring or tandem use.

The wheel has a silver Phil Wood tandem hub, silver 406 mm Sun Rhyno  
rim and 36 Sapim 2 mm stainless steel spokes. A new Phil Wood front  
tandem hub alone is $142. I'll sell the complete front wheel for $140  
plus postage.

See photos at:
http://www.easystreetrecumbents.com/.../screamer.html

Includes featherweight seat cushions, centerstand, and Power Grips on 
the pedals.

All stock parts otherwise. Owner is selling because the stoker lost the 
urge to ride. Under 300 miles, gently used, garage kept.

This is not the Traveler version with the frame couplers, so it will 
incur oversize fees to ship. However, we have the original box 
available. Most likely the frame will ship in one box, the wheels in a 
second box, and the seats in a third, though we may find a box big 
enough for the seats and wheels together. Estimated shipping is probably 
around $175.

A nicely equipped electric trike for in-city use, designed for moving a

career that necessitates more driving.

The X-3 trike is well suited for a range of rider heights and spare 
parts are readily available through any bike shop. The electric system 
is a Wilderness Energy 36V system with an instant-start brushless motor 
built into a 16" wheel. Top speed is about 12mph, but it has excellent 
torque for moving loads up hills.

The motor system reflects Easy Street's years of doing such conversions. 
This system has much more than just the bare essentials.

I bought my Cambie Recumboni X2 new in 1999 two months before I broke my leg in a crash on another bike, and it hasn't been ridden at all since we moved in 2002, so it has spent most of its life in storage. It has direct over-seat steering (like the Tour Easy) instead of the later-model link-steering. Rans seats, Arai rear hub brake with stoker lever, fenders, kickstand, rear rack, bottle cages, Shimano/Sakae drivetrain. Weight is listed by the importer as 45 pounds. $1995/best offer/trade, plus shipping from Las Vegas if necessary ($150 to $300, depending upon destination) or come pick it up while you stay at the Strip -- be sure to bring a trailer, van, or truck!

has very little sidewall wear. Note this older model Ultegra level  
hub takes an 8/9/10-speed cassette but doesn't have the groove at the  
end of the cassette body for taking an 11-tooth cog. However you can  
run an 11-tooth cog on this hub by putting a 1 mm spacer between the

I have a new old stock 2006 USS Grasshopper full suspension SWB  
recumbent. It has never been sold so has the new bike warranty and it  
has only been used for short test rides in dry weather, never crashed  
or scratched so looks new. The only difference between it and the  
current models is it doesn't have the quick release seat (the system  
with the 3 quick releases is retrofittable) and its optional disc  
brakes are Avid BB5 rather than the BB7 they started using in 2008.

The specs and 2009 pricing are as follows:
Grasshopper base bike, green $2590
Under seat steering $59
SRAM Dual Drive 24-speed drivetrain (stock)
MEKS carbon fork with adjustable hydraulic damping $229
Avid BB5 disc brakes (BB7 on current model) $199
Schmidt hub powered headlight & taillight with wiring internally  
routed through frame and rack $469
HP Velotechnik rear rack $115
HP Velotechnik lowrider rack $110
Kickstand $27
SKS mudguards with flaps $59
Standard spring rear shock
Import charges $169
Total $4026

This would make a great commuting or touring bike for those who  
prefer the smooth ride of full suspension.
$2500 plus shipping if it needs to be shipped.

LoGo trikes and some models of Trice use 355 mm wheels.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] Custom Trice Mini for sale
Message-ID: <4B98C39D-ACDA-4313-B908-E1768E508ED8@earthlink.net>

I am selling my one of a kind Inspired Cycle Engineering Mini Light.  
It has
been meticulously set up using much better than stock components and has
been well maintained. I take very god care of my recumbents and have a
maintenance log for the Mini. I originally took delivery of the  
frameset in
September 2002 and first rode the completed trike on 25 October 2002.

The Mini is the most compact recumbent trike I know of due to its narrow
track, short wheelbase and use of 349 mm wheels. The combination of  
narrow
track, short overall length, rear suspension, rear rack, mudguards with
reflective stripes on all wheels, low maintenance hydraulic disc  
brakes and
internal gearing through a Rohloff Speedhub that can be shifted into  
any of
14 gear ratios while stopped, coasting or pedalling make this the ideal
trike for commuting. The gear range is currently 16.44" to 86.46" but  
the
526% overall gear range can easily be moved up or down by simply  
replacing
the chainring or rear cog with one of another size. Also the bottom  
bracket
shell is chamfered for a Schlumpf Speed Drive should you want a wider
overall gear range. I originally configured it with a Speed Drive but  
found
I wasn't using the overdrive gears so converted it to a conventional  
bottom
bracket and single chainring crank to reduce weight, increase  
efficiency and
eliminate accidental front shifting.

The seat is currently set all the way laid back for best aerodynamic
efficiency (29 degrees from horizontal) but can be set as upright as 43
degrees. Information and photos of the Mini can be found at:
http://www.ice.hpv.co.uk/custom_trikes/mini.htm

The specifications are as follows:

Frame: Yellow Trice Mini Light frameset with rear parking brake  
deleted to
save weight. Custom frame fit option with 20 guage main tube
optimised for rider 73 kg (160 lbs.) or less. Extra set of bottle
bosses under boom. Rear suspension option with Cane Creek AD-5 air shock
with neoprene Lizard Skins boot to protect suspension piston from dirt.
Bottom bracket shell with custom headlight mount braze-on, front  
derailer
post deleted and shell chamfered for a Schlumpf Speed Drive. Double  
Rohloff
cable housing guide braze-ons and left rear dropout for Rohloff OEM axle
cap. No braze-ons for derailer cable housings. Note the Light version  
of the
Mini was a limited edition of an already very rare trike and uses  
thinner
wall tubing and titanium and alloy fasteners to reduce weight.

Seat: Trice carbon fibre

Brake levers: Magura Marta

Brakes: Magura Marta hydraulic disc with 160 mm rotors

Headsets: Stronglight A9 roller bearing

Shifter: Rohloff twist grip on right handlebar

Crank: Tracer 155 mm with single 52T chainring and double guard rings

Bottom Bracket: Shimano UN-72 68 x 107 mm

Cog: Rohloff reversable 15T (when worn reverse for double the life)

Chain: SRAM PC-89R hollow side plate chain

Idler: Stock ICE with stock triple Teflon chain tubes

Front Wheels: Custom built with Velocity Aerohead 32-hole rims, DT  
2.0 mm
spokes with brass nipples, ICE narrow front hubs.
(Note the Velocity Aerohead is the lightest 349 mm rim available yet  
is also
very strong due to its double wall construction and triangular shape)

Rear Wheel: Custom built with Velocity Aerohead 32-hole rim, DT 1.8 mm
spokes with brass nipples, Rohloff Speedhub 500/14 XC/EX, OEM,  
silver. The
Rohloff bearings and seals have been replaced using the newest type  
which
have lower friction than the original seals.

Rim strips: Velox tape

Cheng Shin 37-349 presta valve

Tyres: Greenspeed Scorcher 40-349 (the lowest rolling resistance 349 mm
tyres available and wide enough to handle potholes streets well)

Skewers: Rear Delta bolt on skewer in place of quick release to save
weight and add security.

Grips: high density foam

Rack: ICE custom tubular steel cantilevered design, black.

Mudguards: ICE with 3M yellow reflective tape applied to the rear
surfaces.

Cyclecomputer: CatEye Cordless 2 mounted to right front mudguard  
mount for
easy visibility. Current odometer reading: 6820.8 kilometres.

Price: $6157.00 plus shipping if shipped. Note ICE no longer makes  
custom
trikes like the Mini but if it were available new at today's prices  
it would
be over $10,000.00.

Note price does not include pedals but I can include the pedals of
your choice at extra cost or sell without pedals. The CatEye
cyclecomputer can be deleted to reduce the price by $32. The Tracer  
155 mm
cranks can be exchanged for 170 mm Tracer cranks at no additional  
charge or
the crankset of your choice can be installed.

I can remove the rear wheel with Rohloff hub and remove the Rohloff  
shifter and chain tensioner for a price reduction of $1200 to $4957.  
At this price it would be sold without the rear wheel and you could  
set it up with a rear derailer and SRAM Dual Drive equipped rear  
wheel. Or if you want to configure it with conventional gearing with  
front and rear derailers, I can remove the crankset and bottom  
bracket and sell it with a spare matching yellow boom equipped with a  
front derailer post long enough to run up to a 73T front chainring.  
This would reduce the price by $115 to $4842.

Photos of my Mini can be found by clicking the "OWNERS" link at  
"Trice Mini" found at this link to the ICE picture gallery:

I was cleaning out my lighting collection and found the following  
surplus Nightsun parts:

2 new SunSport 6V 6W sealed bulb-reflector units, retails for $19.95,  
will sell these for $10 each.

1 new TriLight 12V 7.5W MR11 sealed bulb-reflector, retails for  
$19.95, will sell for $10.

2 Prostick 9-LED taillights. These were the first high intensity  
remote battery powered LED taillights from the early 1990's. Clear  
plastic tube contains 9 LEDs which are steady (no flashing mode).  
Includes mounting bracket cord with Molex plug. Runs off 12V. These  
were the brightest taillights available in their day and are similar

FS: Challenge Hurricane SL $2100

	I purchased this bike in 2007 from Samuel Harris, who purchased it from 
Kelvin at Angletech as a demo in 2006. I believe it is a 2005. I put on 
about 1000 miles in the last 2 years. It is an absolute speed demon, and 
can climb really well for a 'bent. I have switched out the tires, tubes, 
wheelset, brakes, and front fork. I also changed the second front ring 
to a 56 and went from a road cassette to a mountain one, mainly because 
some of the hilly terrain in Vermont required some more intense brakes 
and nifty climbing gears. It is the fastest bike I have ever ridden, 
hands down, but it is low enough to make it impractical for uses other 
than a road ride. The bike is in good shape, but after a long ride (few 
hours) I find that the Challenge air shock slowly leaks.
	I built some volae/bacchetta inspired dual 559 and 700c highracer 
frames this winter. These are much more multi-purpose, and I need some 
money to spec them out, so I am selling this beautiful machine.

2005 Challenge Hurricane SL flat black.
-Ultegra components, 165mm cranks, 56, 60 tooth challenge front ring 
with guard. unused inner ring on cranks. Aluminum mainframe, Front fork, 
and boom, injection molded- aerospace bonded carbon fiber / aluminum 
rear swingarm and dropouts, challenge air shock, Ti tiller stem, SRAM 
Attack shifters, radius cyclocross brake levers. BB7 Front and Rear Disc 
Brakes, pair spoked Velocity Thracian 9spd. Rear disc wheel 11-34t. 
Velocity Aeroheat & Velocity hub front disc wheel 406 x 1.5" Primo Comet 
tires/tube. I am also including the challenge powerbrake II brake set 
and 406 Schwalbe Stelvio tires/tubes so you can take the rotors and 
calipers off, put the power brakes on and shed some weight if you don't 
want/need the discs. Comes with a computer as well.

I can send pictures if you are interested.

-thanks for looking

Owner is selling because he likes his less reclined Catrike Expedition 
better. This trike has about 3500 miles on it. It has been garage kept 
by someone who knows how to take care of bicycles.

This trike will need to ship in two boxes. Shipping cost depends on 
distance from Austin, Texas, but should be around $90.

The woman that works for the VA coordinating tandem rides for blind

If you have a tandem you are willing to sell please send me: model,
price, pictures.


I included the first detail because i would like to encourage any of
you out there to contact your local blind centers or VA.  there are a
lot of past cyclist that can no longer cycle alone ( i am sure there
are children would would love it too but i don't have contact into
those groups) and each of you can make a difference.  Some of them
love recumbent and others upright bikes (just ask Zach).

thank you.

A nicely equipped electric trike for in-city use, designed for moving a 
child or large amounts of groceries. Owner must sell due to a change of 
career that necessitates more driving.

The X-3 trike is well suited for a range of rider heights and spare 
parts are readily available through any bike shop. The electric system 
is a Wilderness Energy 36V system with an instant-start brushless motor 
built into a 16" wheel. Top speed is about 12mph, but it has excellent 
torque for moving loads up hills.

The motor system reflects Easy Street's years of doing such conversions. 
This system has much more than just the bare essentials.

	wheel
Message-ID: <C2115AAA-915F-4FBE-B6B5-1CD2DDA9FE8B@earthlink.net>

I have available one lightly used 559 mm (AKS 26" MTB size) front  
wheel built around a Schmidt SON28S 32-hole black disc brake hub.  
This hub takes any ISO 6-bolt disc  brake rotor. The rim is a black  
Ritchey OCR Disc which has a curved profile for strength (no parallel  
sidewalls so not for use with rim brakes) and offset spoke holes to  
reduce dish and thus increase wheel strength. Spokes are DT double  
butted 2.0-1.8-2.0 mm laced 3-cross with brass nipples. Includes  
Velox rim strip. This is a very strong wheel and the Schmidt hub is  
the highest quality, most efficient dynamo hub available for powering  
your headlight and taillight. This wheel would be a good choice for a  
mountain bike used for commuting or a 559 mm wheeled disc brake  
equipped recumbent used for commuting or long distance riding such as  
a Bacchetta Giro 26, RANS F5 Enduro, RANS Stratus XP or Volae  
Expedition.

New the SON28S disc brake hub is $333 plus shipping. I'm selling this  
complete wheel for $305 plus shipping.

Unfortunatelly I am forced to sell my *brand new *2009 Stratus XP.
The bike is in the new 2009 champagne silver color.

It is 3 month old. Has been out on the street maybe 3 or 4 times. No
scratches, no dents.
*
This bike is as good as new!!!*

Standard size frame. Chopper Handle Bar.

It is upgraded with:
- Avid BB7 Disk brakes
- Front and rear fender
- RANs rear rack
- Greenfield kickstand

The price for this bike new with all the upgrades is more than $2500.

I will sell it for $1800 plus $50 for shipping = less than 75% of the price
you'd pay for a new bike!

Subject: [hpv-forsale] Schwalbe Marathon Supreme 42-406 tyres for sale
Message-ID: <EDD4B3BB-F8EB-4F67-836D-310154A30570@earthlink.net>

These are the newest Schwalbe 406 mm touring/commuting tyres. This is  
what Schwalbe has to say about them at http://schwalbetires.com/ 
marathon_supreme

"Exceptional. Outstanding. The best. A touring tire that can do  
everything. That was the goal
of our development team. For 2009 we have completely revised our : HD  
Ceramic Guard, TripleNano Compound, LiteSkin side wall. The Marathon  
Supreme is now even lighter and faster. Puncture resistance has also  
been improved and its grip on wet roads remains outstanding!"

I'll add they have reflective sidewall stripes and folding beads and  
are light for their 42 mm width at 325 grams. The maximum pressure  
rating is 6 bar (85 psi).

Schwalbetires sell the Marathon Supreme 42-406 tyres for $69.95 each  
plus shipping. I'm selling these three lightly used ones for $36 each  
plus shipping. I only used them for 429 km (266 miles) commuting on  
my trike since 5 June 2009 and they don't have any visible wear.
