Selling a folding bike, upright or recumbent? Make me an offer.

I recently started a pretty good gig with a pretty nasty commute (and
a vicious telework policy). The good news is, I can take a bus most of
the way. The bad news is, last week I got bumped 3 times due to full
bike racks. So I want something that's easy to take on/off the bus.

TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

He's a good guy, specializing in repair, selling mostly used bikes (he will order new, but doesn't stock them). However neither he nor I have folder experience. So I'd appreciate any recommendations folks could provide (esp pointers to doc) regarding what to {look for, avoid} in an older folder, esp a late 90s Bike Friday.

Late-nineties Bike Friday was a take-apart bike, not really a folder like their newer commuter bikes -- a good bike, but a bit of a chore to take apart and put together twice or more per working day. Among older bikes, a true folder like a Brompton or a Montague is a better choice for a commuter.

Message-ID: <03EE285E6A284FB9B8350DE8D2B94613@newfd2ae8b55ef>

For physical reasons, I can no longer ride my Sidewinder Sport Z. It is in factory condition expept for the fact that the previous owner removed the quick release from the steering wheel in back. I can't do any better for photos than the factory website     www.sidewindercycle.com            Mine is yellow. I think the emphasis on its ability to brake steer is misguided. When I could ride, I used it about once a month.

I am in San Antonio and could meet anybody in Texas halfway. Shipping otherwise is about $85 in the contiguous states. You can see from the website how far it packs down.

I haven't been able to buy these new for a while. I find Woods Valve
tubes, but not in 406 sizes. Anyone have any that are surplus?

Why I like them: the valve fits a Schrader drilled hole, but takes a
Presta pump fitting. You can take the guts out to fill the tube with
TrueGoo.
