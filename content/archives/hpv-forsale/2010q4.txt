Subject: [hpv-forsale] WTB: replacement jockey wheel
Message-ID: <874ocwh401.fsf@pobox.com>


Please recommend a source for a replacement jockey wheel for my Stealth.
Extra points for a supplier in biking distance of Chapel Hill, NC.
Why I ask:

I had noticed increased drivetrain noise on my Stealth for awhile.
Process of elimination led me to the upper jockey wheel: when I removed
it, the plastic part crumbled away from the sealed bearing. (FWIW I
believe this was OEM from 1997.) I tried just removing it and using a
single long (~1m) piece of teflon chain tube (from Hostel Shoppe--I'd
appreciate local suppliers of that, too) fixed to the crossbar underside
of the Stealth's seat (which mates to a sliding fitting on the Stealth's
main tube). Unfortunately the upper chainline curves, and there's enough
friction between the chain and the chaintube to

- be noticeable. It drops me ~1 speed, and I can feel it while pedaling,
  and maybe hear it (though that may be just suggestability).

- pull the chaintube into the front derailleur. I have the chaintube
  ziptied pretty tightly to the seat crossbar, but there is enough
  friction that cranking the chain slowly but surely pulls the chaintube
  forward.

If there's a better way to do this, please lemme know. Until last week I
was using the upper jockey wheel as designed, but with 2 smaller pieces
of chaintube fore and aft of it attaching to the wheel's "cage" (a piece
of Al with 2 holes through which the jockey-wheel-attaching bolt passed)
via ziptie. The jockey wheel's OD (i.e. of the plastic flange) is ~58 mm
and the cage doesn't look like it would accommodate anything much bigger
(though smaller diameter should be good), and its width is ~13 mm.

TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

Great Package and a huge value.

Used Burley Koosah is also a sweet deal.

$75 would get either recumbent shipped to your doorstep (continental US).

I have a complete, new, in box Rans seat that I bought years
ago for a project that didn't materialize.

Just to be safe, send me your email address and I can post a
photo of all the pieces so that you can confirm that it is the
model you want/need?

It appears to be the "Tour Easy" model from their site:

hasn't been installed and they doesn't include mesh or mounting  
hardware. I'll sell for $60. Shipping extra if it can't be picked up

older Trice or for use on a homebuilt. I don't know if it will fit a  
modern ICE trike.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] RANS Seavo tandem
Message-ID: <E4E5DF70-B265-4844-AA93-A004440300AF@sonic.net>

2009 RANS Seavo tandem, yellow, non-S&S coupled version. This has  
been ridden as a demo bike and has only 829.6 kilometres on the  
odometer (514.4 miles). It looks new, has never been sold and is  
being offered as a new bike with new bike warranty. This bike has the  
following upgrades over a stock Seavo shown here: http:// 
ransbikes.com/Seavo.htm

Deleted the stock 170 mm cranks and installed da Vinci 150 mm cranks  
on Tange alloy cup bottom brackets as the 170 mm cranks on a previous  
Seavo I had were ill suited to this bike design since they resulted  
in massive heel to front wheel interference on tight turns and the  
stoker's heels scraping the ground when cornering. The 150 mm cranks  
solve these problems plus make for smoother spinning, are easier on  
the knees allow running the handlebars lower and slightly reduce  
frontal area. I run 150-155 mm cranks on all my personal bikes and  
have long legs. The daVinci tandem crankset has daVinci 34T timing  
rings and Sugino 44/32/22 drive rings. If for some reason you want to  
use longer cranks, I can remove the da Vinci cranks and Tange bottom  
brackets for a cost reduction or change them out for the cranks and  
bottom brackets of your choice.

Replaced the much too wide RANS handlebars with Bacchetta handlebars  
which are also lighter. These are the same handlebars used on the  
Bacchetta Giro, not the narrower ones used on the Corsa and CA 2.0. I  
actually initially tried the narrower version of the Bacchetta  
handlebars and found them too narrow on tight turns as the front  
wheel has to be turned more on low speed turns on the tandem due to  
its much longer wheelbase.

Replaced the too tall RANS steering riser tube with a Bacchetta riser  
tube which brings the handlebars down to a more ergonomic position  
less in the line of sight yet still has plenty of leg clearance. Also  
saves weight.

Deleted rear V-Brake as the dual 203 mm Avid BB7 brakes offer plenty  
of braking power and heat dissipation area and I don't like the idea  
of the stoker having a brake as the stock setup has.

Replaced the heavy SRAM 11-32 cassette with a lighter weight and  
better shifting Shimano XT 11-32 cassette.

Replaced the grey Avid Speed Dial 7 brake levers with black SRAM 9.0  
brake levers to cosmetically match the black handlebars and for a  
slight weight savings.

Replaced the stock thick seat pads with RANS thin seat covers with  
integrated foam to save weight, make it easier to put the feet down  
and reduce the leg angle to the pedals for increased comfort and  
pedaling efficiency for short stokers. I can swap back one or both  
pads for the stock pads at no extra cost. Here is a link for the thin  
pad: http://www.shoprans.com/proddetail.asp?prod=BPST0133

Replaced wide carbon fibre stoker seat base with a narrower RANS  
Zephyr carbon fibre seat base to reduce leg to seat base rub for  
shorter stokers.

Added CatEye Strada Wireless cyclecomputer cleanly installed behind  
the top of the steering riser where it doesn't add any frontal area  
or get in the way.

New the stock Seavo is $6575. The price on this one is $4895 if  
picked up locally. I'd prefer not to ship it but do have the original  
wooden shipping box which is too large for UPS so it has to be  
transported by some sort of trucking company.

Novatec is a major Taiwanese hub manufacturer both selling hubs under  
their own name and making them for other brands.

I have one slightly used Novatec A141SB 24-hole front hub for  
standard 100 mm dropout spacing. It is black and has cartridge  
bearings. It came from a wheel that came on a RANS F5. Here is a link:

I am selling this hub for $20 plus postage.

Message-ID: <1EF1DB2E-3A17-4E1A-B17C-F17FCFB9D95E@sonic.net>

I received some Panaracer Minits Lite folding 32-406 (AKA 20x1.25")  
tyres. These are made in Japan and appear to be very high quality.  
They are all black with completely smooth treads and thin, supple  
casings so they look like they will have low rolling resistance,  
perhaps at the expense of durability. The claimed weight is 180 g and  
I weighed one at 181 g and another at 182 g. For comparison I've  
weighed Schwalbe Durano folding 28-406 tyre at 170 to 181 g. This  
makes the Panaracer Minits Lite the second lightest 406 mm tyre  
available and the lightest in the 32 mm width. $40 plus postage. To  
arrange purchase, e-mail me at the address in my signature below.

I have two 451 tubes (28mm nominal width) with Presta valve.  There is nothing wrong with them; I think they're new.  It's been years since I had a bike with 451 wheels, and it's time to give them a new home.

Free for the price of shipping anywhere, which will be about $3 to US addresses, or pick up in person in the San Francisco bay area.

I have a set (left and right) of carbon fibre aerodynamic wheel  
covers for a 406 mm wheel that were made by Garrie Hill for the rear  
wheel of my Earth Cycles Sunset. I have sold the Sunset so am making  
these wheel covers available. They were designed to work with a  
Velocity Aeroheat 406 mm rim built into a rear wheel with disc brake  
hub. The two halves bolt together for easy installation and removal.  
I weighed the set of wheel covers with mounting hardware at 185  
grams. I don't know what they are worth but will take any reasonable  
offer for them. They are in excellent condition and photos of them on  
the Sunset can be found here:
http://www.recumbentblog.com/images/020408a5.jpg
http://www.recumbentblog.com/images/020408a9.jpg

I also have available the rear wheel these wheel covers were mounted  
to. It has a Velocity Aeroheat 406 mm rim built to a Hugi (DT Swiss)  
240 disc brake rear hub with 32 2.0 mm stainless steel spokes and  
brass nipples.

Message-ID: <5EEECD52-7E19-40CC-A7B1-CF4E69347995@sonic.net>

I have a pair of new in boxes Continental Grand Prix Supersonic 20-571 (AKA 650x20) tyres. These no longer made tyres were designed for time trial use and are super light. I weighed one of them at 128 grams and the other at 130 grams. Their maximum inflation pressure is 12 BAR (170 psi).

On the box it reads "The fastest clincher in the world! The Grand Prix Supersonic offers exceptionally low rolling resistance that rivals that of our renowned tubulars. Our super-fine polyamide casing combined with a thin layer of ASC Silica tread compound is extremely lightweight (140g - 700x20c). The Supersonic has outstanding wet and dry adhesion with excellent ride. Possibly one of the best time trial tires ever designed, the distinctive black sidewall and anthracite tread looks fast standing still."

I'll sell the pair for $50 plus postage cost (if necessary).

Message-ID: <75FB522E-5DB7-451C-B22E-FBE1A8FAFCD9@sonic.net>

I have one lightly used HED H3 571 mm (AKA 650c) clincher front wheel for sale. I only used it on special events in dry weather. This wheel has the newer rim extrusion with thicker hooks at the edges to keep the tyre on at high pressures. Older H3 wheels had minimal hooks at the edges of the rim and had a reputation for looser fitting tyres like the Vredestein Fortrezza blowing off. The thicker hooks correct that problem and this wheel has them. That does make this wheel heavier at 840 grams vs. 796 grams for the original.

HED sells the H3 front wheel for $800:
http://www.hedcycling.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=3&idcategory=3

I'm selling this wheel for $400 plus shipping (if necessary). The wheel is in this photo:
http://www.recumbentblog.com/images/121106a8.jpg

As you can see it doesn't have the latest HED graphics shown here: 
http://www.hedcycling.com/wheels/H3_clincher.asp

However, it does have the latest rim which I think is much more important than the graphics.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] Old stock elliptical chainrings (revised list
	16.12.2010)
Message-ID: <6E0EBE68-9432-4E70-8AF2-80E22C9D117F@sonic.net>

Several more chainrings sold, this is the revised list.

I have the following elliptical or non-round chainrings for sale. All are aluminium with a silver finish. These are an inexpensive (compared to Q-Rings) way to experiment with non-round chainrings. They are listed in order from smallest to largest bolt circle diameter and within those categories lowest to highest number of teeth.

74 mm bolt circle diameter:

Climb Control 22T x 74 mm BCD (only uses 3 bolts, and only fits holes on 36T Climb Control rings), 1 used $10

Climb Control 22T x 74 mm BCD (only uses 3 bolts, and only fits holes on 36T Climb Control rings, 2 very used $3

Climb Control 24T x 74 mm BCD (only uses 3 bolts, requires removable spacers on cranks), 3 slightly used $20 each

110 mm bolt circle diameter:

Climb Control 36T x 110 mm BCD, 2 used $15 each

Climb Control 36T x 110 mm BCD, 4 very used $5 each

Sugino Cycloid 38T x 110 mm BCD, 11 new $20 each

Sugino Cycloid 40T x 110 mm BCD, 1 new $20

Climb Control 46T x 110 mm BCD, 2 used $20 each

Climb Control 46T x 110 mm BCD, 3 very used $10 each

Sugino Cycloid 48T x 110 mm BCD, 10 new $25 each

Subject: [hpv-forsale] 2010 SRAM X.0 short cage rear derailer for sale
Message-ID: <4A955621-DF56-44A4-8D3A-0F9C86EA0E9E@sonic.net>

I am selling this excellent condition 2010 SRAM X.0 short cage 9-speed rear derailer because I converted the bike it was on from a 9-speed 11-34 cassette to a 10-speed 11-36 cassette. It was only used for road riding and never dropped or crashed. It has a claimed weight of 190 g and I weighed it at just 182 g which is extremely light for a rear derailer, 14 g less than I weighed the 2011 10-speed X.0 short cage replacement derailer at.

According to SRAM, this 2010 X.0 rear derailer has the following features:
ESP compatible (1:1 actuation ratio) for ESP trigger or twist shifters
D.I.R.T. (direct Route Technology) for light-effort shifting performance
Forged lloy links and B-knuckle with Grilon composite P-knuckle
Titanium hardware and parallelogram return spring
Heat-treated, oversized pivot pins and sealed cartridge bearing pulleys
Carbon fibre outer cage with alloy inner cage
8/9-speed compatible with top-normal resting position
"Select" colour options have colour-anodised B-bolt, inner cage, and outer parallelogram link, plus colour matched pad-print graphics on P-body

This one has the standard silver/carbon/black colour scheme so it will go with any bike.

$133 plus postage (if necessary). Photos available.

I bought a medium framed 24 as a complete bike with intentions of converting it into a 650 then I bought a ready to ride large framed 650 so now I would like to sell the 24 or trade for a catrike. The bike is all original with less than 500 miles on it.

The previous owner cared for this bike meticulously, it's in great shape.   A red 1998 Tour Easy, 1 owner.   His description is good - "Has full zzipper fairing. Crank is a Shimano 105 from back when they were nice and hollow. Bottom bracket is, I believe 105. Front der. is 105, rear is XT with XTR pulleys. Rear brake is SRAM 7.0.  Front wheel came from ER and is radially laced LX with Sun rim. Rear wheel is Ultegra and Mavic SUP with XTR cassette. Tires are Conti rear and Kenda front with perhaps 25 miles on them. Possibly 5k miles on the bike."

Back to Recycled Recumbents.   Frame is in great shape, very clean if I do say so myself.   The tires are 85 PSI commuter tires.   That 105 crankset is a 175mm crank. Frame size is Easy Racer's Large.  The bike shifts well, rides great.  Has water bottle cages, a rack for a pump.  I put a kickstand on it and a Mirracle mirror.   The Bebops on it are for me.  You get regular cage pedals, and if you want them the set of Look pedals that came on the bike.   Fairing is in fair condition - there are cracks at the handlebar mount, both sides - fixed tastefully with Duct tape.   After you fall in love with it and want to put a spiffy fairing on your bike, you can get the experimenter's kit from Zzipper for under $150 and make this bike truly sexy.   Offered at $1,000, I will ship US at your cost.    Thanks for looking.   Pictures on the web at
