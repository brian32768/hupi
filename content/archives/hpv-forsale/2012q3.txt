Subject: [hpv-forsale] FOR SALE: Upgraded RANS Formula V2
Message-ID: <A8C23C93-78B9-4DA5-91D6-611AA55067B8@cruzio.com>

I?m offering for $1,095.00 my upgraded RANS Formula V2 long-wheelbase recumbent bicycle. This is a fast bike, lightweight for its class. Its configuration is no longer offered. It is comparable to the current Formula LE model, but equipped to better specifications. Its frame is polished aluminum, set up with RANS ?chopper? 3-way adjustable handlebars. I bought it new from Hostel Shoppe in 2008, and I?ve ridden it less than 100 miles. I added a Windwrap RNS full front grey-tinted fairing, a black Tailsok seat-back fairing, a ?dashboard? bar with three bottle cages mounted, and two Cage Rocket S-pods for carrying tubes and small tools, all from Terra Cycle. It is in perfect, like-new condition. I will include SPD pedals, if desired. Its specs as-is include:

Truvativ Elita Powerglide 52/39/30 T crankset.

SRAM X-7 rear derailleur.

SRAM X-5 grip shifters.

Avid Single Digit caliper brakes.

Volae brake levers.

Alex DA-16 wheel rims, rear 559 mm. / front 406 mm.

Kenda Kwest 100 psi road tires.

 I?m in Santa Cruz, California. If you're interested, e-mail me at jweller at cruzio.com. Or call my cell phone: 510-325-1361. I can provide pictures if requested.
