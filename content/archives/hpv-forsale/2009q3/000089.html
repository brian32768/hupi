<PRE>Is anybody interested in one of the first Zox to make it into the US.  It's either the first or second one that made it into this country.  They were actually not being sold in the US.  Oliver Zechlin  bought this one for me and mailed it to me.  (I paid him of course.)
But, I built it up with parts I had around  (e.g. Avocet crank and bottom bracket) plus some new gripshifter deraileurs and brakes from Topo (by Performance Cycles) and two new wheels built for me by Fool's Crow Cyclery in Tallahassee.  I also had a large chain ring made by a guy whose name I have forgotten.
The seat cushion got ditched a long time ago.  The chain is rusty.  And, I haven't ridden it in 5 or 6 years.  It's only got about 300 miles on the frame.  I rode a couple of metric centuries and on rails-to-trails around my home.
Can we negotiate?  It's in the Tampa Bay area.  
</PRE>
