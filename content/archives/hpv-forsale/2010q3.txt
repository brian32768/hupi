Subject: [hpv-forsale] 46-tooth Q-Ring for sale
Message-ID: <4F65C83D-409B-4A18-A7EB-8210B24DB775@sonic.net>

I am selling one slightly used Rotor Q-Ring 46-tooth x 110 mm BCD  
chainring for $116 plus postage if it needs to be shipped. These are  
$185 new. I used this on a 406 mm drive wheel bike with single  
chainring and SRAM Dual Drive hub with 11-34 cassette giving a gear  
range of 18.27" to 105.21". Because it was used on a single chainring  
bike it doesn't have any wear from shifting.

My knees really like the smooth power delivery of Q-Rings and have  
them on all my recumbents I ride regularly. The only reason why I'm  
selling this 46T Q-Ring is because I found the 18.27" first gear  
insufficiently low for some of the steep hills around here and seldom  
used the top gear. So I replaced it with a 40T Q-Ring giving a gear  
range of 15.89" to 91.49".

Separable cadence and speed lines.

They can be pulled apart gently, up to the handlebar mounting bracket.
130 cm cadence sensor cable, 140 cm speed sensor cable.

 

Speedo should take a 18.5" OD tire to 140 mph.    Eat your Watties.

Other bike speedometers would only take a 18.5" to 56 mph.  Not near fast
enough for a real rider.

Message-ID: <580E3164-0B25-4565-B912-187FF3028F0D@sonic.net>

I recently received a shipment of Bebop pedals and cleats from VP  
Components (who made them for Bebop for years and now sell them under  
their own name). The pedals come with cleats and cleat mounting  
hardware. Replacement cleats come with mounting hardware.

The Bebop pedals are available in three versions.
The BBP-11 has black coated CrMo spindles, weighs 210 g/pair and  
costs $95
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp?

The BBP-01 has silver stainless steel spindles, weighs 195 g/pair and  
costs $150
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp? 
btn=2&cat1=2&cat2=11&pid=10

The BBP-21 has gold titanium spindles, weighs 150g/pair and costs $350
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp? 
btn=2&cat1=2&cat2=11&pid=9

A set of replacement cleats with hardware are $40.
http://www.vpcomponents.com/vpone/product_detail.asp? 
btn=2&cat1=2&cat2=12&pid=12

I've been using Bebop pedals since they first became available in  
1996 and typically get a bit over 15,000 km out of a set of cleats.

The prices do not include postage if they need to be shipped. Like  
with all the bicycle components and accessories I sell, if you see  
them advertised for a lower price I can match that price.

Message-ID: <E3C172848BDE48568C7F7E58A1C2FE7A@MarkHPDV5>

2001 V-Rex, $500. 8000 actual miles. Mostly standard RANS components for
that year: 9-speed SRAM 9.0/105/LX, old style seat clamp. Upgraded with
Magura hydraulic rim (not disc) brakes, new Grip Shifts, new headset, newish
RANS seat back, Specialized computer. Tires: Rear is your choice of Ritchey
Tom Slick 1.4 or Avocet Cross II; front is Primo 1.75 and/or Tioga Comp Pool
(you get both). Could use a new seat cushion cover. It's in the Rans
gallery: http://www.ransbikes.com/Gallery/Gardner.htm.

I am pricing it somewhat low IMO, due to a slight bend in the frame stay
just behind the head tube (see photo), which happened on Thanksgiving 2002
when my Thule rack fell off the car at 20 mph, with the bike on it. I've
ridden it 5000 miles since then with no problems, and honestly don't think
it has any functional effect.

Located in Longmont, CO. Local sale preferred.

I am selling my 2008 HP Velotechnik Speedmachine demo bike. This bike  
has only been ridden brief test rides on dry streets around my shop  
and is being sold as a new bike with full warranty. It has never been  
crashed or dropped and looks new.

It has the following options (with 2010 prices shown after options):
Speedmachine complete bike, silver, aerobars (OSS U-bar type  
steering) $2690
BodyLink seat
Standard rear spring (for rider weight up to 100 kg)
Standard Marathon Racer 40 mm tyres
Concept front suspension with standard spring for riders up to 100 kg  
$439
Shimano XT 27-speed drivetrain $249
155 mm cranks $35
Avid BB7 disc brakes $199
Total $3612 plus shipping and duty

Further information and specifications on the Speedmachine can be  
found here:
http://hpvelotechnik.com/produkte/spm/index_e.html

I am selling this Speedmachine for $2700 plus shipping.

So you save $912 over the cost of a 2010 Speedmachine for essentially  
the same bike with the same components.

If you have any questions, want photos sent or would like to  
purchase, e-mail or phone me (contact info in signature below).

Subject: [hpv-forsale] RANS Seavo tandem
Message-ID: <D350DC13-8459-4862-B46E-D6C11BACDA8C@sonic.net>

2009 RANS Seavo tandem, yellow, non-S&S coupled version. This has  
been ridden as a demo bike and has only 829.6 kilometres on the  
odometer (514.4 miles). It looks new, has never been sold and is  
being offered as a new bike with new bike warranty. This bike has the  
following upgrades over a stock Seavo shown here: http:// 
ransbikes.com/Seavo.htm

Deleted the stock 170 mm cranks and installed da Vinci 150 mm cranks  
on Tange alloy cup bottom brackets as the 170 mm cranks on a previous  
Seavo I had were ill suited to this bike design since they resulted  
in massive heel to front wheel interference on tight turns and the  
stoker's heels scraping the ground when cornering. The 150 mm cranks  
solve these problems plus make for smoother spinning, are easier on  
the knees allow running the handlebars lower and slightly reduce  
frontal area. I run 150-155 mm cranks on all my personal bikes and  
have long legs. The daVinci tandem crankset has daVinci 34T timing  
rings and Sugino 44/32/22 drive rings. If for some reason you want to  
use longer cranks, I can remove the da Vinci cranks and Tange bottom  
brackets for a cost reduction or change them out for the cranks and  
bottom brackets of your choice.

Replaced the much too wide RANS handlebars with Bacchetta handlebars  
which are also lighter. These are the same handlebars used on the  
Bacchetta Giro, not the narrower ones used on the Corsa and CA 2.0. I  
actually initially tried the narrower version of the Bacchetta  
handlebars and found them too narrow on tight turns as the front  
wheel has to be turned more on low speed turns on the tandem due to  
its much longer wheelbase.

Replaced the too tall RANS steering riser tube with a Bacchetta riser  
tube which brings the handlebars down to a more ergonomic position  
less in the line of sight yet still has plenty of leg clearance. Also  
saves weight.

Deleted rear V-Brake as the dual 203 mm Avid BB7 brakes offer plenty  
of braking power and heat dissipation area and I don't like the idea  
of the stoker having a brake as the stock setup has.

Replaced the heavy SRAM 11-32 cassette with a lighter weight and  
better shifting Shimano XT 11-32 cassette.

Replaced the grey Avid Speed Dial 7 brake levers with black SRAM 9.0  
brake levers to cosmetically match the black handlebars and for a  
slight weight savings.

Replaced the stock thick seat pads with RANS thin seat covers with  
integrated foam to save weight, make it easier to put the feet down  
and reduce the leg angle to the pedals for increased comfort and  
pedaling efficiency for short stokers. I can swap back one or both  
pads for the stock pads at no extra cost. Here is a link for the thin  
pad: http://www.shoprans.com/proddetail.asp?prod=BPST0133

Replaced wide carbon fibre stoker seat base with a narrower RANS  
Zephyr carbon fibre seat base to reduce leg to seat base rub for  
shorter stokers.

Added CatEye Strada Wireless cyclecomputer cleanly installed behind  
the top of the steering riser where it doesn't add any frontal area  
or get in the way.

New the stock Seavo is $6575. The price on this one is $4895 if  
picked up locally. I'd prefer not to ship it but do have the original  
wooden shipping box which is too large for UPS so it has to be  
transported by some sort of trucking company.

Message-ID: <87k4mv3tdt.fsf@pobox.com>


To those of you who have messages waiting to go out on the list, and
to whoever is maintaining our mailman: please note that attempting to
access hpv-forsale's mailman moderation queue gets a 500. If you don't
know what that means:

The reason why hpv-forsale does not have spam (at least as some of us
define it--YMMV) is that all posts to the list are moderated: i.e. a
real human (at least as I define me :-) must approve any post before
it goes to you. The software that does this, and much more, is mailman:

http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/

Unfortunately, our particular installation of mailman currently has a
problem: when I attempt to look at the items awaiting moderation, I
get

http://hupi.org/mailman/admindb/hpv-forsale
> Bug in Mailman version 2.1.11
> We're sorry, we hit a bug!
> Please inform the webmaster for this site of this problem.

Unfortunately I lack rights to fix that (and probably the time, even if
I did), so I'm hoping that this post reaches someone who will fix that.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikAom-YCsKcY9eKCRpsu751ZOxG1QVTsugwbCa7@mail.gmail.com>

Vision's first year for a production high-racer. The R-60 ?Saber? series
bikes are the fastest bicycles Vision ever made. With dual 24" wheels their
handling is a bit more like a traditional road bike but with the comfort of
a recumbent. The Saber bikes have more laid-back rider position and a higher
bottom-bracket. They put the rider in a faster low wind resistance position,
have higher seats than most recumbents, riders under ~5?8? may have trouble
reaching the ground. Above Average shape.

$475 firm. Extra tires and tubes included.  Shipping extra.

Only selling because there are not enough hooks in the garage! i.e. too many
bikes!

Email Biker at BIKEIOWA.com if interested.

Message-ID: <970CBAA8-0742-4D69-BA44-F1EEB4A952D5@sonic.net>

I recently received this new OSS Grasshopper FX and no one has ridden  
it other than myself doing a brief test ride after assembling it. The  
specifications and prices are as follows:
Grasshopper FX, OSS, green $2690
ErgoMesh seat (can fit BodyLink seat for same price)
Medium rear spring (can fit with hard rear spring for same price)
MEKS Carbon AC fork with hydraulic damping $229
Sugino 155 mm cranks $35
Total $2954

HP Velotechnik is raising their prices on 1 October so if you want a  
new HP Velotechnik, now is a good time to order before the prices go up.

Message-ID: <4C962A87.70609@easystreetrecumbents.com>

Standard Frame Corsa SS, 2009, $1795 plus shipping

Upgrades include 62-tooth chainring (39/52/62 triple crankset), Schwalbe 
Ultremo tires, Look pedals and cleats, yellow Brain Box bag, mirror, 
spare tube, side-load bottle cage.

SRAM X0 shifters and rear derailer. Low miles... tires, grips and seat 
all in great shape. Chain still good.

The oversize chainrings would make this bike less fit for hilly terrain, 
but it is well suited for flat ground and aerodynamic enhancements like 
a TailSock, which can be added for $200.

Message-ID: <5BD0D29B-5C4D-45A7-B43E-06ABCD4DF294@sonic.net>

I have one slightly used Bacchetta front sidepull brake. The cable  
enters from the bottom on the non-drive side to avoid chain or boom  
interference. This is one of the older silver brakes, not the black  
ones that come on new Bacchetta bikes. It has Koolstop Salmon pads  
which don't show much wear. This came off a Bacchetta Aero that I  
converted to a front disc brake. $20 plus $4.95 Priority Mail if it  
isn't picked up locally.
