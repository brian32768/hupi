Hi Joel,

That is a VERY large chainring!
Unless you have a 16&quot; or 20&quot;  nominal diameter drive wheel, it might be 
a bit difficult to use on a normal bike/trike. As an athletic rider I 
have a Challenge Hurricane (20&quot; (406mm) wheels) with 60 tooth and 56 
tooth front rings, and an 11-38 9 speed group in the back. I love the 
gear/speed range it gives me. I couldn't really imagine pushing that 20&quot; 
wheel and keeping a comfortable cadence with an extra 13 teeth unless I 
was on a flat with a strong tailwind or going at lest slightly downhill.

The only other thing that comes to mind is the length of your front 
derailleur cage, as it may not be able to easily make jumps between 
smaller rings and that big ring, nor may the post that holds it be long 
enough to accommodate the combined derailleur and chainring height.

best of luck, I'd like to know if you put it to use!
