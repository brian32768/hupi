<PRE>Orange II velomobile.  Build details at
<A HREF="http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/Teubner/orangeII.htm">http://www.wisil.recumbents.com/wisil/Teubner/orangeII.htm</A>

I decided to build a really good vehicle for self-supported touring.  I just
finished a 5-day 350 mile self-supported tour and decided that I don't care
for touring.  The bike was excellent, but my body wore out and my attitude
was bad.  Rode for 2 hours in the rain one day, and none of the cargo got
wet.  Ran 17 mph into a headwind for the last 5 miles to home at the end of
a 91 mile day.  This trike works well.  Fly into GFK, stay in our guest
room, ride it for a few days to decide if you really want it, and I will
either haul you back to GFK, or you can ride it home.  Or drive up and get
it; 56751.  It will fit in a minivan with the back seats out.  Price is
$3000 if you want to negotiate, $1500 if you don't.  teubner at wiktel dot
com 218-463-4549 days, 1007 evenings/weekends.

Update:  I am 5&quot;10&quot; with a 43&quot; X-seam and wear size 43-44 Shimano SPD
sandals.  I'm not certain how much adjustment there is in the bike, but I
would expect 41-44 X-seam but not much larger shoes.
