Subject: [hpv-forsale] Lightning Thumbolt price?
Message-ID: <mailman.0.1334580120.32262.hpv-forsale@hupi.org>

I need to sell a Lightning Thunderbolt. It has had very little use.

I don't have a good idea of what it might be worth. It's the economy
model from Lightning that they no longer make, and it sold for about
$1K.

Any help?

TC

The economy model sells for $800 now.

Subject: [hpv-forsale] FS: 2006 MR Recumbent SWIFT plus rollers
Message-ID: <COL120-W153A992A1E72DE45CE7CA4C93F0@phx.gbl>


It is an old Australian Swift race trike made in 2006. It has maybe 50 road miles on it. It weighs 26 lbs.



It comes with rollers for the rear wheel. I added the aluminum sides to 
the seat. The seat is aluminum with some padding. I had fenders and a 
rack installed by the manufacturer http://mrrecumbenttrikes.com/mrtrikes.html and it is now called the Ultra Swift that sells for $4,950 AU ($5,208 USD).



However - I am 5'8" with a pants inseam of 30" and the trike was made 
for me. It is probably adjustable for someone up to 5'10". You might be 
able to change the seat so you sit a little higher or even add a mesh 
seat as with the new models. Components are good quality, a Deore rear 
d?railleur.

I would like $1,600. Some pictures are posted on Craigslist: http://boise.craigslist.org/bik/2899421019.html The bike/rollers will ship in 4 boxes if necessary.

Thank you,
Jerome

I was organising my shop and came across this rare rigid carbon fibre  
mountain bike fork some of you may be interested in. I bought it for  
a project I ended up not going through with.

New in box Ritchey WCS Carbon disc brake mountain bike fork. Has  
never been installed. Super light, I weighed it at 480 grams. It has  
a 1-1/8" x 300 mm carbon steerer. The axle to crown measurement is  
409 mm and the offset is 48 mm. More info can be found here: http:// 
www.ritcheylogic.com/dyn_prodfamily.php?k=98469

Will sell for $340.

My Stealth SWB recently got hit by a car. (I did not, because I managed
to clip out just before the car hit the crank.) My LBS (great guy, but
doesn't do any other recumbents) says he can get all the replacement
parts *except* a 60t 130mm chainwheel. Please help!

I have a 2002 Swift that was shipped to the US from http://mrrecumbenttrikes.com/mrtrikes.html. It is now called the Ultra Swift and retails for now $4,950 AU, weighing 25 lbs without accessories. It comes with a detachable rack, headrest, fenders and computer, no mirror.

I added "wings" to the seat to make it seem more stable in tight turns. It comes with a $100 set of "rollers." The tires are used and old but do not have more than 100 road miles on them. It rides like a low racer with the seat cushion that came with it :) A very large 56 tooth dual chain ring and a 9 tooth rear cluster. A non-specific Deore rear d?railleur. No name front brakes. The rear 26" wheel is missing every 3rd spoke for light weight.

***>It was custom built for me with an x-seam of 42 inches. There are two adjusting points on the square frame so it might accommodate someone up to a 45 inch x-seam. I would say there is +/-3 inches of adjustment.

For $1,550 US I will ship it to you, OBO. If you wish to have the Coroplast tail section we can arrange a meeting place or extra shipping costs. The trike is in the central mountains of Idaho.

Dunno why I said "chainwheel" instead of chainring. Apologies for the
repeat post, and just in case someone's searching the list:

Veulta carries the 60t 130 ring we use on the tandem. Its a flat ring, not
ramped and/or pinned.

I'm offering to sell my pretty 2005 RANS Stratus Classic for $895. I paid $1500 for it new in 2007. I'm in Santa Cruz, California. This LWB recumbent bike is in excellent condition, has been very well maintained, and has been ridden less than 1,000 miles. The ?Classic? model is no longer in production. The XL-size frameset is similar in design to the current Stratus LE. The higher component specs are similar to those of the current Stratus XP model.

Specs include:

Beautiful deep emerald green paint job.
Truvativ Roleur triple crankset, 170 mm.
SRAM X-9 rear derailleur and shift levers.
Avid SD-7 brakes and brake levers.
Alex DA-16 rims, 559 mm. rear wheel, 406 mm. front wheel.
Primo comet tyres.
RANS B37 black handlebars.
RANS Rad-loc seat clamp.
Mem-lock seat rail position keeper, Velogenesis seat strut clamps.
RANS rear rack.
RANS Streamline Tail-pack, yellow.
