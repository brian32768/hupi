<div style="text-align: left;">On 5th December Al Krause of the IHPVA
(the Californian version) took control of the registration for the
domain name "IHPVA.org" in a hostile takeover against the wishes of the
IHPVA (international version), owner of the domain name. The registrar
"godaddy.com" forked it over in less than an hour without any advance
notice to the legal registrants Richard Ballantine or Brian Wilson. We
recommend anyone who has a domain to protect that is using this
company's service to move it. <br><br>There is at present a mirror on <a href="http://www.whpva.org">http://www.whpva.org</a>
but Al Krause has demanded control of this as well and anyway countless
links of archival material may break in the future. You may be able to
find pre-December 2008 content on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ihpva.org" target="_blank">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ihpva.org</a> We find the tactics of the Californian IHPVA deplorable and will now concentrate on content here at HuPI in the future.<br><br>Cheers! <br>Brian Wilson<br>ihpva.org webmaster 1996 (or so) - 2008<br>Corvallis, Oregon, USA<br><br>Theo Schmidt, editor <a href="http://www.hupi.org/HPeJ/index.htm">HPeJ</a><br>Steffisburg, Switzerland<br><br></div>
